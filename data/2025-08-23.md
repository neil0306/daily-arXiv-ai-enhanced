### [1] [Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904)
*Jianfeng Si,Lin Sun,Zhewen Tan,Xiangzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified co-training framework that integrates multiple safety behaviors (positive, negative, rejective) within a single SFT stage, enabling dynamic control via system instructions or magic tokens at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety methods like SFT and RLHF rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained post-deployment controllability, requiring a more efficient and flexible solution.

Method: Proposes a co-training framework that simultaneously trains multiple safety behaviors in a single SFT stage, using system-level instructions or magic tokens to dynamically activate different safety modes during inference.

Result: Matches safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with an 8B model surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance while significantly reducing training complexity and deployment costs.

Conclusion: Presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety that enables fine-grained behavioral switching and demonstrates strong safety robustness through a distinct Safety Alignment Margin.

Abstract: Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained,
post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a
unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety
behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and
rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably,
each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction,
or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at
inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as
positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and
rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals.
This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the
output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions
corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides
empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented
fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety
alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1
(671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training
complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and
highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Preliminary automatic ranking for WMT25 MT shared task, with caveats about bias towards re-ranking systems and pending human evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide task participants with early results for system preparation while acknowledging limitations of automatic metrics.

Method: Automatic evaluation metrics applied to machine translation systems in the WMT25 General MT Shared Task.

Result: Preliminary ranking generated, but may be biased towards systems using re-ranking techniques like Quality Estimation or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding.

Conclusion: This is not the final ranking - official results will be based on more reliable human evaluation that will supersede this automatic ranking.

Abstract: We present the preliminary ranking of the WMT25 General Machine Translation
Shared Task, in which MT systems have been evaluated using automatic metrics.
As this ranking is based on automatic evaluations, it may be biased in favor of
systems that employ re-ranking techniques, such as Quality Estimation
re-ranking or Minimum Bayes Risk decoding. The official WMT25 ranking will be
based on human evaluation, which is more reliable and will supersede the
automatic ranking.
  The purpose of this report is not to present the final findings of the
General MT task, but rather to share preliminary results with task
participants, which may be useful when preparing their system submission
papers.

### [3] [Bridging the Culture Gap: A Framework for LLM-Driven Socio-Cultural Localization of Math Word Problems in Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14913)
*Israel Abebe Azime,Tadesse Destaw Belay,Dietrich Klakow,Philipp Slusallek,Anshuman Chhabra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-driven framework for cultural localization of math word problems to address English-centric entity bias in multilingual benchmarks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual mathematical reasoning lags behind English due to scarcity of culturally-grounded datasets with native entities like names, organizations, and currencies

Method: Framework for automatic cultural localization using LLMs to construct datasets with native entities from existing sources

Result: Translated benchmarks obscure true multilingual math ability; framework mitigates English-centric bias and improves robustness with native entities

Conclusion: LLM-driven cultural localization effectively addresses entity bias and enhances multilingual math reasoning performance across languages

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in
solving mathematical problems expressed in natural language. However,
multilingual and culturally-grounded mathematical reasoning in low-resource
languages lags behind English due to the scarcity of socio-cultural task
datasets that reflect accurate native entities such as person names,
organization names, and currencies. Existing multilingual benchmarks are
predominantly produced via translation and typically retain English-centric
entities, owing to the high cost associated with human annotater-based
localization. Moreover, automated localization tools are limited, and hence,
truly localized datasets remain scarce. To bridge this gap, we introduce a
framework for LLM-driven cultural localization of math word problems that
automatically constructs datasets with native names, organizations, and
currencies from existing sources. We find that translated benchmarks can
obscure true multilingual math ability under appropriate socio-cultural
contexts. Through extensive experiments, we also show that our framework can
help mitigate English-centric entity bias and improves robustness when native
entities are introduced across various languages.

### [4] [Improving LLMs for Machine Translation Using Synthetic Preference Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14951)
*Dario Vajda,Domen Vreš,Marko Robnik-Šikonja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning a general instruction-tuned LLM (GaMS-9B-Instruct) using DPO on programmatically curated Slovene translation data improves machine translation performance over baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance machine translation capabilities of general instruction-tuned large language models using minimal, easily produced data resources, specifically for low-resource languages like Slovene.

Method: Used Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on programmatically curated dataset from English Wikipedia translations. Generated quality-ranked translation pairs using GaMS-9B-Instruct and EuroLLM-9B-Instruct, ranked with heuristics and COMET metrics.

Result: The fine-tuned model outperformed both baseline models, achieving COMET score gains of ~0.04 and ~0.02 respectively on Wikipedia translations, with more consistent avoidance of language and formatting errors.

Conclusion: DPO training with programmatically curated preference data effectively improves machine translation performance in LLMs, demonstrating a viable approach for enhancing translation quality with limited resources.

Abstract: Large language models have emerged as effective machine translation systems.
In this paper, we explore how a general instruction-tuned large language model
can be improved for machine translation using relatively few easily produced
data resources. Using Slovene as a use case, we improve the GaMS-9B-Instruct
model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training on a programmatically
curated and enhanced subset of a public dataset. As DPO requires pairs of
quality-ranked instances, we generated its training dataset by translating
English Wikipedia articles using two LLMs, GaMS-9B-Instruct and
EuroLLM-9B-Instruct. We ranked the resulting translations based on heuristics
coupled with automatic evaluation metrics such as COMET. The evaluation shows
that our fine-tuned model outperforms both models involved in the dataset
generation. In comparison to the baseline models, the fine-tuned model achieved
a COMET score gain of around 0.04 and 0.02, respectively, on translating
Wikipedia articles. It also more consistently avoids language and formatting
errors.

### [5] [Multilingual Datasets for Custom Input Extraction and Explanation Requests Parsing in Conversational XAI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14982)
*Qianli Wang,Tatiana Anikina,Nils Feldhus,Simon Ostermann,Fedor Splitt,Jiaao Li,Yoana Tsoneva,Sebastian Möller,Vera Schmitt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses limitations in multilingual Conversational XAI systems by introducing MultiCoXQL dataset extension and Compass dataset for custom input extraction, with evaluations across multiple languages and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ConvXAI systems based on intent recognition face challenges with multilingual generalization due to training data scarcity and limited support for free-form custom inputs in languages beyond English.

Method: Introduces MultiCoXQL (multilingual extension of CoXQL dataset across 5 languages) and Compass dataset for custom input extraction. Proposes new parsing approach and evaluates multiple LLMs and BERT-type models using various parsing strategies.

Result: The research provides multilingual datasets spanning 5 typologically diverse languages including a low-resource language, and conducts comprehensive evaluations including monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual assessments.

Conclusion: The work bridges gaps in multilingual ConvXAI systems by providing datasets and evaluation frameworks that support better multilingual generalization and custom input handling across diverse languages.

Abstract: Conversational explainable artificial intelligence (ConvXAI) systems based on
large language models (LLMs) have garnered considerable attention for their
ability to enhance user comprehension through dialogue-based explanations.
Current ConvXAI systems often are based on intent recognition to accurately
identify the user's desired intention and map it to an explainability method.
While such methods offer great precision and reliability in discerning users'
underlying intentions for English, a significant challenge in the scarcity of
training data persists, which impedes multilingual generalization. Besides, the
support for free-form custom inputs, which are user-defined data distinct from
pre-configured dataset instances, remains largely limited. To bridge these
gaps, we first introduce MultiCoXQL, a multilingual extension of the CoXQL
dataset spanning five typologically diverse languages, including one
low-resource language. Subsequently, we propose a new parsing approach aimed at
enhancing multilingual parsing performance, and evaluate three LLMs on
MultiCoXQL using various parsing strategies. Furthermore, we present Compass, a
new multilingual dataset designed for custom input extraction in ConvXAI
systems, encompassing 11 intents across the same five languages as MultiCoXQL.
We conduct monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual evaluations on Compass,
employing three LLMs of varying sizes alongside BERT-type models.

### [6] [Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling Is An Efficient Test-Time Weak-to-Strong Aligner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15044)
*Bolian Li,Yanran Wu,Xinyu Luo,Ruqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm uses an aligned draft model with an unaligned target model to achieve efficient test-time alignment of LLMs with human preferences, reducing inference costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time alignment techniques for LLMs often incur substantial inference costs, limiting practical application. The paper aims to address this efficiency bottleneck while maintaining alignment quality.

Method: Proposes SSS algorithm that uses a human-preference-aligned draft model with an unaligned target model, modifying acceptance criteria and bonus token distribution to exploit distributional shift between models.

Result: Achieves superior gold reward scores at significantly reduced inference cost in test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments.

Conclusion: SSS algorithm effectively addresses the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment while maintaining alignment quality, making it practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has become a
critical step in their development. Recent research has increasingly focused on
test-time alignment, where additional compute is allocated during inference to
enhance LLM safety and reasoning capabilities. However, these test-time
alignment techniques often incur substantial inference costs, limiting their
practical application. We are inspired by the speculative sampling
acceleration, which leverages a small draft model to efficiently predict future
tokens, to address the efficiency bottleneck of test-time alignment. We
introduce the reward-Shifted Speculative Sampling (SSS) algorithm, in which the
draft model is aligned with human preferences, while the target model remains
unchanged. We theoretically demonstrate that the distributional shift between
the aligned draft model and the unaligned target model can be exploited to
recover the RLHF optimal solution without actually obtaining it, by modifying
the acceptance criterion and bonus token distribution. Our algorithm achieves
superior gold reward scores at a significantly reduced inference cost in
test-time weak-to-strong alignment experiments, thereby validating both its
effectiveness and efficiency.

### [7] [LongRecall: A Structured Approach for Robust Recall Evaluation in Long-Form Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15085)
*MohamamdJavad Ardestani,Ehsan Kamalloo,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongRecall is a three-stage framework for evaluating recall in machine-generated text that decomposes answers into facts, filters candidates, and verifies alignment through structured entailment checks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing recall metrics rely on lexical overlap and are prone to errors with paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods suffer from misalignment and hallucinations without structured verification, creating risks in critical domains like medicine and law.

Method: A three-stage framework that: 1) decomposes answers into self-contained facts, 2) narrows candidate matches through lexical and semantic filtering, and 3) verifies alignment through structured entailment checks to reduce false positives/negatives.

Result: Substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines on three challenging long-form QA benchmarks, validated with both human annotations and LLM-based judges.

Conclusion: LongRecall serves as a foundational building block for systematic recall assessment, effectively handling diverse phrasings and contextual variations while reducing errors in completeness evaluation of machine-generated text.

Abstract: LongRecall. The completeness of machine-generated text, ensuring that it
captures all relevant information, is crucial in domains such as medicine and
law and in tasks like list-based question answering (QA), where omissions can
have serious consequences. However, existing recall metrics often depend on
lexical overlap, leading to errors with unsubstantiated entities and
paraphrased answers, while LLM-as-a-Judge methods with long holistic prompts
capture broader semantics but remain prone to misalignment and hallucinations
without structured verification. We introduce LongRecall, a general three-stage
recall evaluation framework that decomposes answers into self-contained facts,
successively narrows plausible candidate matches through lexical and semantic
filtering, and verifies their alignment through structured entailment checks.
This design reduces false positives and false negatives while accommodating
diverse phrasings and contextual variations, serving as a foundational building
block for systematic recall assessment. We evaluate LongRecall on three
challenging long-form QA benchmarks using both human annotations and LLM-based
judges, demonstrating substantial improvements in recall accuracy over strong
lexical and LLM-as-a-Judge baselines.

### [8] [Mapping the Course for Prompt-based Structured Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15090)
*Matt Pauk,Maria Leonor Pacheco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Combining LLMs with combinatorial inference improves structured prediction by enhancing consistency and accuracy, with structured learning remaining valuable despite LLM advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucinations and complex reasoning due to their autoregressive nature, particularly in structured prediction tasks where structural consistency is crucial.

Method: Proposes combining LLMs with combinatorial inference, experimenting with various prompting strategies to estimate LLM confidence values for use with symbolic inference methods.

Result: Symbolic inference on top of prompting alone consistently leads to more accurate and consistent predictions. Calibration and fine-tuning with structured prediction objectives further improve performance on challenging tasks.

Conclusion: Structured learning remains valuable in the LLM era, and the combination of LLMs with symbolic inference methods effectively addresses hallucinations and improves reasoning consistency in structured prediction tasks.

Abstract: LLMs have been shown to be useful for a variety of language tasks, without
requiring task-specific fine-tuning. However, these models often struggle with
hallucinations and complex reasoning problems due to their autoregressive
nature. We propose to address some of these issues, specifically in the area of
structured prediction, by combining LLMs with combinatorial inference in an
attempt to marry the predictive power of LLMs with the structural consistency
provided by inference methods. We perform exhaustive experiments in an effort
to understand which prompting strategies can effectively estimate LLM
confidence values for use with symbolic inference, and show that, regardless of
the prompting strategy, the addition of symbolic inference on top of prompting
alone leads to more consistent and accurate predictions. Additionally, we show
that calibration and fine-tuning using structured prediction objectives leads
to increased performance for challenging tasks, showing that structured
learning is still valuable in the era of LLMs.

*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi,Sanjeev Satheesh,Shrimai Prabhumoye,Mostofa Patwary,Mohammad Shoeybi,Bryan Catanzaro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Nemotron-CC-Math is a high-quality mathematical corpus extracted from Common Crawl using a novel pipeline that preserves mathematical structure across various formats, yielding significant performance gains in math, code, and general reasoning tasks when used for LLM pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math datasets from Common Crawl suffer from degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text conversion, and failure to preserve mathematical structure, limiting their effectiveness for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: A novel domain-agnostic pipeline using layout-aware rendering with lynx and targeted LLM-based cleaning to recover math across various formats (MathJax, KaTeX, MathML), preserve structural integrity of equations and code blocks, remove boilerplate, standardize notation to LaTeX, and correct inconsistencies.

Result: Created Nemotron-CC-Math-3+ (133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens) datasets. Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ surpasses all prior open math datasets and contains 5.5x more tokens than previous highest-quality dataset. Pretraining Nemotron-T 8B model yielded +4.8 to +12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over baselines, while improving general-domain performance.

Conclusion: This work presents the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific content including math from noisy web-scale data, achieving measurable gains across multiple reasoning domains and setting new state-of-the-art for open math pretraining corpora, with code and datasets released to support open-source efforts.

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on high-quality, structured data
such as mathematics and code substantially enhances reasoning capabilities.
However, existing math-focused datasets built from Common Crawl suffer from
degraded quality due to brittle extraction heuristics, lossy HTML-to-text
conversion, and the failure to reliably preserve mathematical structure. In
this work, we introduce Nemotron-CC-Math, a large-scale, high-quality
mathematical corpus constructed from Common Crawl using a novel,
domain-agnostic pipeline specifically designed for robust scientific text
extraction.
  Unlike previous efforts, our pipeline recovers math across various formats
(e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML) by leveraging layout-aware rendering with lynx
and a targeted LLM-based cleaning stage. This approach preserves the structural
integrity of equations and code blocks while removing boilerplate,
standardizing notation into LaTeX representation, and correcting
inconsistencies.
  We collected a large, high-quality math corpus, namely Nemotron-CC-Math-3+
(133B tokens) and Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ (52B tokens). Notably,
Nemotron-CC-Math-4+ not only surpasses all prior open math datasets-including
MegaMath, FineMath, and OpenWebMath-but also contains 5.5 times more tokens
than FineMath-4+, which was previously the highest-quality math pretraining
dataset. When used to pretrain a Nemotron-T 8B model, our corpus yields +4.8 to
+12.6 gains on MATH and +4.6 to +14.3 gains on MBPP+ over strong baselines,
while also improving general-domain performance on MMLU and MMLU-Stem.
  We present the first pipeline to reliably extract scientific
content--including math--from noisy web-scale data, yielding measurable gains
in math, code, and general reasoning, and setting a new state of the art among
open math pretraining corpora. To support open-source efforts, we release our
code and datasets.

### [10] [Identifying and Answering Questions with False Assumptions: An Interpretable Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15139)
*Zijie Wang,Eduardo Blanco*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses how to handle questions with false assumptions by using external evidence and atomic assumption validation to reduce LLM hallucinations and provide interpretable answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models often generate misleading answers to questions with false assumptions due to hallucinations, requiring a method to identify and address these false premises.

Method: The approach reduces the problem to fact verification, leverages external evidence to mitigate hallucinations, and generates/validates atomic assumptions for interpretability.

Result: Experiments with five LLMs show that incorporating retrieved evidence is beneficial, and generating/validating atomic assumptions yields further improvements while specifying false assumptions.

Conclusion: Using external evidence and atomic assumption validation effectively reduces hallucinations in LLMs when answering questions with false assumptions, providing more accurate and interpretable responses.

Abstract: People often ask questions with false assumptions, a type of question that
does not have regular answers. Answering such questions require first
identifying the false assumptions. Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate
misleading answers because of hallucinations. In this paper, we focus on
identifying and answering questions with false assumptions in several domains.
We first investigate to reduce the problem to fact verification. Then, we
present an approach leveraging external evidence to mitigate hallucinations.
Experiments with five LLMs demonstrate that (1) incorporating retrieved
evidence is beneficial and (2) generating and validating atomic assumptions
yields more improvements and provides an interpretable answer by specifying the
false assumptions.

*Seungmin Han,Haeun Kwon,Ji-jun Park,Taeyang Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMDR-Bench is a new multi-modal dialogue reasoning benchmark with 300 complex scenarios, and CoLVLM Agent framework enhances LVLMs with memory-perception-planning-execution cycle, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LVLMs struggle with complex multi-turn visually-grounded tasks requiring deep reasoning, entity tracking, and sustained contextual understanding. Existing benchmarks fail to capture real-world multi-modal interaction complexities.

Method: Introduces MMDR-Bench dataset with 300 complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios (5-7 turns each) across 6 dimensions. Proposes CoLVLM Agent framework using iterative "memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle without extensive re-training.

Result: CoLVLM Agent achieves average human evaluation score of 4.03, surpassing GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (3.85). Shows significant advantages in reasoning depth, instruction adherence, error suppression, and maintains robust performance over extended turns.

Conclusion: The modular design and iterative approach of CoLVLM Agent effectively addresses complex multi-modal interaction challenges, validating the framework's superiority over current state-of-the-art commercial models.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), current models still face substantial
challenges in handling complex, multi-turn, and visually-grounded tasks that
demand deep reasoning, sustained contextual understanding, entity tracking, and
multi-step instruction following. Existing benchmarks often fall short in
capturing the dynamism and intricacies of real-world multi-modal interactions,
leading to issues such as context loss and visual hallucinations. To address
these limitations, we introduce MMDR-Bench (Multi-Modal Dialogue Reasoning
Benchmark), a novel dataset comprising 300 meticulously designed complex
multi-turn dialogue scenarios, each averaging 5-7 turns and evaluated across
six core dimensions including visual entity tracking and reasoning depth.
Furthermore, we propose CoLVLM Agent (Contextual LVLM Agent), a holistic
framework that enhances existing LVLMs with advanced reasoning and instruction
following capabilities through an iterative
"memory-perception-planning-execution" cycle, requiring no extensive
re-training of the underlying models. Our extensive experiments on MMDR-Bench
demonstrate that CoLVLM Agent consistently achieves superior performance,
attaining an average human evaluation score of 4.03, notably surpassing
state-of-the-art commercial models like GPT-4o (3.92) and Gemini 1.5 Pro
(3.85). The framework exhibits significant advantages in reasoning depth,
instruction adherence, and error suppression, and maintains robust performance
over extended dialogue turns, validating the effectiveness of its modular
design and iterative approach for complex multi-modal interactions.

### [12] [SemToken: Semantic-Aware Tokenization for Efficient Long-Context Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15190)
*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemToken is a semantic-aware tokenization framework that reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency by using contextual semantic embeddings and local clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tokenization approaches like BPE and WordPiece rely purely on frequency statistics and ignore semantic structure, leading to over-tokenization of redundant spans and underutilization of contextual coherence in long-context scenarios.

Method: SemToken extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders, performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens, and allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density (finer-grained in content-rich regions, coarser compression in repetitive spans).

Result: Experiments show up to 2.4× reduction in token count and 1.9× speedup on benchmarks like WikiText-103 and LongBench, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity and downstream accuracy.

Conclusion: Semantic structure offers a promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large language models, with SemToken demonstrating significant efficiency improvements while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a critical role in language modeling, yet existing
approaches such as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece operate purely on
frequency statistics, ignoring the underlying semantic structure of text. This
leads to over-tokenization of semantically redundant spans and underutilization
of contextual coherence, particularly in long-context scenarios. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SemToken}, a semantic-aware tokenization framework that
jointly reduces token redundancy and improves computation efficiency. SemToken
first extracts contextual semantic embeddings via lightweight encoders and
performs local semantic clustering to merge semantically equivalent tokens.
Then, it allocates heterogeneous token granularity based on semantic density,
allowing finer-grained tokenization in content-rich regions and coarser
compression in repetitive or low-entropy spans. SemToken can be seamlessly
integrated with modern language models and attention acceleration methods.
Experiments on long-context language modeling benchmarks such as WikiText-103
and LongBench show that SemToken achieves up to $2.4\times$ reduction in token
count and $1.9\times$ speedup, with negligible or no degradation in perplexity
and downstream accuracy. Our findings suggest that semantic structure offers a
promising new axis for optimizing tokenization and computation in large
language models.

*Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Jie Zhu,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fin-PRM is a domain-specialized process reward model for financial reasoning that outperforms general PRMs and improves downstream LLM performance in financial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRMs are trained on general or STEM domains and perform poorly in finance where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and requires factual/regulatory correctness.

Method: Fin-PRM integrates step-level and trajectory-level reward supervision for fine-grained evaluation of financial reasoning. Applied in offline/online settings for: (1) distillation-based SFT, (2) RL with dense process rewards, (3) reward-informed Best-of-N inference.

Result: Outperforms general PRMs and domain baselines on financial benchmarks (CFLUE, FinQA). Downstream models show 12.9% gain in SL, 5.2% in RL, and 5.1% in test-time performance.

Conclusion: Domain-specialized reward modeling is valuable for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning, demonstrating significant improvements over general approaches.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising framework for
supervising intermediate reasoning in large language models (LLMs), yet
existing PRMs are primarily trained on general or Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) domains and fall short in domain-specific
contexts such as finance, where reasoning is more structured, symbolic, and
sensitive to factual and regulatory correctness. We introduce \textbf{Fin-PRM},
a domain-specialized, trajectory-aware PRM tailored to evaluate intermediate
reasoning steps in financial tasks. Fin-PRM integrates step-level and
trajectory-level reward supervision, enabling fine-grained evaluation of
reasoning traces aligned with financial logic. We apply Fin-PRM in both offline
and online reward learning settings, supporting three key applications: (i)
selecting high-quality reasoning trajectories for distillation-based supervised
fine-tuning, (ii) providing dense process-level rewards for reinforcement
learning, and (iii) guiding reward-informed Best-of-N inference at test time.
Experimental results on financial reasoning benchmarks, including CFLUE and
FinQA, demonstrate that Fin-PRM consistently outperforms general-purpose PRMs
and strong domain baselines in trajectory selection quality. Downstream models
trained with Fin-PRM yield substantial improvements with baselines, with gains
of 12.9\% in supervised learning, 5.2\% in reinforcement learning, and 5.1\% in
test-time performance. These findings highlight the value of domain-specialized
reward modeling for aligning LLMs with expert-level financial reasoning. Our
project resources will be available at https://github.com/aliyun/qwen-dianjin.

TL;DR: SPARK is a training-free KV cache compression method that uses channel-level pruning to reduce memory usage by over 30% while maintaining model accuracy, enabling longer sequence processing within the same memory budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods focus on temporal axis compression but ignore fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (channel axis), limiting their ability to balance efficiency and accuracy effectively.

Method: SPARK applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV cache at the channel level and dynamically restoring pruned entries during attention score computation. It's a plug-and-play method orthogonal to existing compression techniques.

Result: SPARK reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods while preserving or improving model accuracy. Even with 80% pruning ratio, it maintains performance with less than 5% degradation compared to baseline.

Conclusion: SPARK effectively addresses the KV cache bottleneck by leveraging channel-level redundancy, enabling longer sequence processing with the same memory budget while maintaining model performance, and is compatible with existing compression techniques for further acceleration.

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with
sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing
approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal
axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and
computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained
importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis),
thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model
accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically
across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero
information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this
oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies
unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically
restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our
approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques,
making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration.
By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer
sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK
not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage
by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an
aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less
degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its
robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at

*Bolei He,Xinran He,Run Shao,Shanfu Shu,Xianwei Xue,Mingquan Cheng,Haifeng Li,Zhenhua Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selct2Know (S2K) is a cost-effective framework that improves domain-specific QA by progressively internalizing knowledge through self-selection strategy and selective fine-tuning, outperforming existing methods with lower cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific QA due to long-tail knowledge distribution. RAG causes hallucinations and latency, while continued pretraining is costly and inflexible across domains.

Method: Proposes S2K framework with internal-external knowledge self-selection, selective supervised fine-tuning, structured reasoning data generation pipeline, and GRPO integration for enhanced reasoning.

Result: Experiments on medical, legal, and financial QA benchmarks show S2K consistently outperforms existing methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

Conclusion: S2K provides an effective and cost-efficient solution for domain-specific QA by mimicking human progressive learning and optimizing knowledge utilization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general QA but often struggle in
domain-specific scenarios. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces
external knowledge but suffers from hallucinations and latency due to noisy
retrievals. Continued pretraining internalizes domain knowledge but is costly
and lacks cross-domain flexibility. We attribute this challenge to the
long-tail distribution of domain knowledge, which leaves partial yet useful
internal knowledge underutilized. We further argue that knowledge acquisition
should be progressive, mirroring human learning: first understanding concepts,
then applying them to complex reasoning. To address this, we propose Selct2Know
(S2K), a cost-effective framework that internalizes domain knowledge through an
internal-external knowledge self-selection strategy and selective supervised
fine-tuning. We also introduce a structured reasoning data generation pipeline
and integrate GRPO to enhance reasoning ability. Experiments on medical, legal,
and financial QA benchmarks show that S2K consistently outperforms existing
methods and matches domain-pretrained LLMs with significantly lower cost.

### [16] [Self-Guided Function Calling in Large Language Models via Stepwise Experience Recall](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15214)
*Sijia Cui,Aiyao He,Shuai Xu,Hongming Zhang,Yanna Wang,Qingyang Zhang,Yajing Wang,Bo Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER is a self-guided method that performs stepwise retrieval from an experience pool to improve LLM tool usage, achieving significant performance gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step tool usage including tool selection, parameter generation, and planning. Existing methods require manual demonstration design and complex prompt engineering, which becomes inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty scale.

Method: Stepwise Experience Recall (SEER) performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from a continually updated experience pool. It incrementally augments the pool with past successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion and improved performance over time.

Result: On ToolQA benchmark: 6.1% improvement on easy questions, 4.7% on hard questions. On τ-bench with real-world domains: 7.44% gain with Qwen2.5-7B and 23.38% gain with Qwen2.5-72B models.

Conclusion: SEER provides an effective self-guided approach for improving LLM tool usage through continuous experience accumulation and stepwise retrieval, demonstrating substantial performance improvements across different model sizes and benchmarks.

Abstract: Function calling enables large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external systems by leveraging tools and APIs. When faced with multi-step tool
usage, LLMs still struggle with tool selection, parameter generation, and
tool-chain planning. Existing methods typically rely on manually designing
task-specific demonstrations, or retrieving from a curated library. These
approaches demand substantial expert effort and prompt engineering becomes
increasingly complex and inefficient as tool diversity and task difficulty
scale. To address these challenges, we propose a self-guided method, Stepwise
Experience Recall (SEER), which performs fine-grained, stepwise retrieval from
a continually updated experience pool. Instead of relying on static or manually
curated library, SEER incrementally augments the experience pool with past
successful trajectories, enabling continuous expansion of the pool and improved
model performance over time. Evaluated on the ToolQA benchmark, SEER achieves
an average improvement of 6.1\% on easy and 4.7\% on hard questions. We further
test SEER on $\tau$-bench, which includes two real-world domains. Powered by
Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-72B models, SEER demonstrates substantial accuracy gains
of 7.44\% and 23.38\%, respectively.

*Momoka Furuhashi,Kouta Nakayama,Takashi Kodama,Saku Sugawara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selective checklist use improves automatic evaluation performance in pairwise comparisons but shows inconsistent benefits in direct scoring tasks, highlighting the need for clearer evaluation criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using LLMs faces challenges due to ambiguous criteria, and while automatic checklist generation shows promise, its effectiveness remains underexplored.

Method: Investigated selective vs. universal checklist use, generated checklists using six methods, evaluated across eight model sizes, and analyzed correlation with human evaluations through pairwise comparison and direct scoring experiments.

Result: Selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation performance in pairwise settings but shows less consistent benefits in direct scoring. Checklist items with low correlation to human scores often still reflect human-written criteria, indicating human evaluation inconsistencies.

Conclusion: Findings emphasize the need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human and automatic evaluations, as current inconsistencies affect both approaches.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of generative tasks using large language models faces
challenges due to ambiguous criteria. Although automatic checklist generation
is a potentially promising approach, its usefulness remains underexplored. We
investigate whether checklists should be used for all questions or selectively,
generate them using six methods, evaluate their effectiveness across eight
model sizes, and identify checklist items that correlate with human
evaluations. Through experiments on pairwise comparison and direct scoring
tasks, we find that selective checklist use tends to improve evaluation
performance in pairwise settings, while its benefits are less consistent in
direct scoring. Our analysis also shows that even checklist items with low
correlation to human scores often reflect human-written criteria, indicating
potential inconsistencies in human evaluation. These findings highlight the
need to more clearly define objective evaluation criteria to guide both human
and automatic evaluations. \footnote{Our code is available

*Hanling Zhang,Yayu Zhou,Tongcheng Fang,Zhihang Yuan,Guohao Dai,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VocabTailor is a dynamic vocabulary selection framework that reduces SLM memory usage by up to 99% through embedding offloading and hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection, outperforming static pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models (SLMs) face memory bottlenecks on edge devices due to large vocabulary components (embeddings and LM heads), and existing static pruning methods cause information loss and lack flexibility.

Method: Based on lexical locality principle and computational asymmetry insights, VocabTailor implements a decoupled framework with embedding offloading and hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection for LM Head, enabling on-demand loading of vocabulary components.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show VocabTailor achieves up to 99% reduction in vocabulary-related memory usage with minimal or no performance degradation across diverse downstream tasks.

Conclusion: VocabTailor substantially outperforms existing static vocabulary pruning by providing flexible, on-demand vocabulary selection while maintaining performance, making SLMs more viable for resource-constrained edge deployments.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) provide computational advantages in
resource-constrained environments, yet memory limitations remain a critical
bottleneck for edge device deployment. A substantial portion of SLMs' memory
footprint stems from vocabulary-related components, particularly embeddings and
language modeling (LM) heads, due to large vocabulary sizes. Existing static
vocabulary pruning, while reducing memory usage, suffers from rigid,
one-size-fits-all designs that cause information loss from the prefill stage
and a lack of flexibility. In this work, we identify two key principles
underlying the vocabulary reduction challenge: the lexical locality principle,
the observation that only a small subset of tokens is required during any
single inference, and the asymmetry in computational characteristics between
vocabulary-related components of SLM. Based on these insights, we introduce
VocabTailor, a novel decoupled dynamic vocabulary selection framework that
addresses memory constraints through offloading embedding and implements a
hybrid static-dynamic vocabulary selection strategy for LM Head, enabling
on-demand loading of vocabulary components. Comprehensive experiments across
diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that VocabTailor achieves a reduction of
up to 99% in the memory usage of vocabulary-related components with minimal or
no degradation in task performance, substantially outperforming existing static
vocabulary pruning.

TL;DR: WangchanThaiInstruct is a human-authored Thai instruction dataset that improves LLM performance in Thai through culturally-grounded native supervision, outperforming translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for low-resource languages like Thai rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific nuances needed for real-world applications, creating performance gaps in instruction-following capabilities.

Method: Created a human-authored Thai dataset through multi-stage quality control with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers, covering four professional domains and seven task types. Conducted zero-shot evaluation and instruction tuning studies with ablations to isolate native supervision effects.

Result: Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance improvements on culturally and professionally specific tasks.

Conclusion: Culturally and professionally grounded instruction data is essential for improving LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings, highlighting the limitations of translation-based approaches.

Abstract: Large language models excel at instruction-following in English, but their
performance in low-resource languages like Thai remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks often rely on translations, missing cultural and domain-specific
nuances needed for real-world use. We present WangchanThaiInstruct, a
human-authored Thai dataset for evaluation and instruction tuning, covering
four professional domains and seven task types. Created through a multi-stage
quality control process with annotators, domain experts, and AI researchers,
WangchanThaiInstruct supports two studies: (1) a zero-shot evaluation showing
performance gaps on culturally and professionally specific tasks, and (2) an
instruction tuning study with ablations isolating the effect of native
supervision. Models fine-tuned on WangchanThaiInstruct outperform those using
translated data in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. These findings
underscore the need for culturally and professionally grounded instruction data
to improve LLM alignment in low-resource, linguistically diverse settings.

TL;DR: UniCoM pipeline generates high-quality code-switched speech samples using SWORDS algorithm to substitute words with translations while preserving semantics, creating CS-FLEURS corpus for ASR and S2TT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching is common in real conversations but challenging for multilingual speech technology due to scarcity of suitable datasets.

Method: Propose Universal Code-Mixer (UniCoM) pipeline with SWORDS algorithm that substitutes words with translations while considering parts of speech, without altering sentence semantics.

Result: Constructed CS-FLEURS corpus achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to existing datasets on objective and subjective metrics.

Conclusion: The approach advances CS speech technology and enables more inclusive multilingual systems.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternation between two or more languages within a
single speaker's utterances, is common in real-world conversations and poses
significant challenges for multilingual speech technology. However, systems
capable of handling this phenomenon remain underexplored, primarily due to the
scarcity of suitable datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Universal
Code-Mixer (UniCoM), a novel pipeline for generating high-quality, natural CS
samples without altering sentence semantics. Our approach utilizes an algorithm
we call Substituting WORDs with Synonyms (SWORDS), which generates CS speech by
replacing selected words with their translations while considering their parts
of speech. Using UniCoM, we construct Code-Switching FLEURS (CS-FLEURS), a
multilingual CS corpus designed for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and
speech-to-text translation (S2TT). Experimental results show that CS-FLEURS
achieves high intelligibility and naturalness, performing comparably to
existing datasets on both objective and subjective metrics. We expect our
approach to advance CS speech technology and enable more inclusive multilingual
systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EMNLP framework evaluates teacher-role LLMs' personality, moral development, and ethical vulnerability to soft prompt injection, revealing idealized personalities, strong abstract reasoning but emotional struggles, and a safety-capability paradox.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation for LLMs simulating professional roles, particularly in education where ethical alignment is crucial.

Method: Developed EMNLP framework with extended scales and 88 teacher-specific moral dilemmas, tested on 12 LLMs with targeted soft prompt injection to assess compliance and vulnerability.

Result: Teacher-role LLMs show more idealized/polarized personalities than humans, excel in abstract moral reasoning but struggle with emotional complexity. Stronger reasoning models are more vulnerable to harmful prompts, showing safety-capability paradox.

Conclusion: EMNLP provides the first benchmark for assessing ethical and psychological alignment of teacher-role LLMs, highlighting critical safety concerns in educational AI applications.

Abstract: Simulating Professions (SP) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to emulate
professional roles. However, comprehensive psychological and ethical evaluation
in these contexts remains lacking. This paper introduces EMNLP, an
Educator-role Moral and Normative LLMs Profiling framework for personality
profiling, moral development stage measurement, and ethical risk under soft
prompt injection. EMNLP extends existing scales and constructs 88
teacher-specific moral dilemmas, enabling profession-oriented comparison with
human teachers. A targeted soft prompt injection set evaluates compliance and
vulnerability in teacher SP. Experiments on 12 LLMs show teacher-role LLMs
exhibit more idealized and polarized personalities than human teachers, excel
in abstract moral reasoning, but struggle with emotionally complex situations.
Models with stronger reasoning are more vulnerable to harmful prompt injection,
revealing a paradox between capability and safety. The model temperature and
other hyperparameters have limited influence except in some risk behaviors.
This paper presents the first benchmark to assess ethical and psychological
alignment of teacher-role LLMs for educational AI. Resources are available at

*Eunseong Choi,June Park,Hyeri Lee,Jongwuk Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE is a new RAG method that uses a context assessor with memory token embeddings and soft prompting to resolve conflicts between external context and LLM's parametric knowledge, achieving 5.0% performance gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address context-memory conflicts in RAG systems where retrieved external context contradicts the LLM's correct parametric knowledge, causing the model to fail at resolving such conflicts.

Method: Introduces Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation (CARE) with a context assessor that encodes compact memory token embeddings and uses grounded/adversarial soft prompting to discern unreliable context and guide reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments show CARE effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, achieving an average 5.0% performance gain on QA and fact-checking benchmarks.

Conclusion: CARE establishes a promising direction for developing trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems by effectively handling knowledge conflicts between external context and internal parametric knowledge.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge into their input
prompts. However, when the retrieved context contradicts the LLM's parametric
knowledge, it often fails to resolve the conflict between incorrect external
context and correct parametric knowledge, known as context-memory conflict. To
tackle this problem, we introduce Conflict-Aware REtrieval-Augmented Generation
(CARE), consisting of a context assessor and a base LLM. The context assessor
encodes compact memory token embeddings from raw context tokens. Through
grounded/adversarial soft prompting, the context assessor is trained to discern
unreliable context and capture a guidance signal that directs reasoning toward
the more reliable knowledge source. Extensive experiments show that CARE
effectively mitigates context-memory conflicts, leading to an average
performance gain of 5.0\% on QA and fact-checking benchmarks, establishing a
promising direction for trustworthy and adaptive RAG systems.

### [23] [TComQA: Extracting Temporal Commonsense from Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15274)
*Lekshmi R Nair,Arun Sankar,Koninika Pal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with temporal commonsense reasoning. This paper proposes a pipeline to automatically extract temporal commonsense from text using LLMs, creating TComQA dataset that improves model performance on temporal QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Machines struggle to infer implicit temporal context from events described in natural language, and even advanced LLMs have difficulty with temporal commonsense reasoning due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.

Method: Proposed a temporal commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine temporal commonsense from text, constructing TComQA dataset from SAMSum and RealNews corpora.

Result: TComQA achieves over 80% precision in extracting temporal commonsense through crowdsourcing validation. Models trained with TComQA outperform LLMs fine-tuned on existing temporal QA datasets.

Conclusion: Automatically mining temporal commonsense using LLMs enables creation of robust language models that better understand temporal context, addressing a key limitation in current NLP systems.

Abstract: Understanding events necessitates grasping their temporal context, which is
often not explicitly stated in natural language. For example, it is not a
trivial task for a machine to infer that a museum tour may last for a few
hours, but can not take months. Recent studies indicate that even advanced
large language models (LLMs) struggle in generating text that require reasoning
with temporal commonsense due to its infrequent explicit mention in text.
Therefore, automatically mining temporal commonsense for events enables the
creation of robust language models. In this work, we investigate the capacity
of LLMs to extract temporal commonsense from text and evaluate multiple
experimental setups to assess their effectiveness. Here, we propose a temporal
commonsense extraction pipeline that leverages LLMs to automatically mine
temporal commonsense and use it to construct TComQA, a dataset derived from
SAMSum and RealNews corpora. TComQA has been validated through crowdsourcing
and achieves over 80\% precision in extracting temporal commonsense. The model
trained with TComQA also outperforms an LLM fine-tuned on existing dataset of
temporal question answering task.

TL;DR: CUPE is a lightweight phoneme recognition model that processes 120ms windows independently, achieving competitive cross-lingual performance by learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many speech processing tasks require pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, but current approaches typically require analyzing long speech segments and language-specific patterns.

Method: CUPE processes short, fixed-width windows (120ms, about one phoneme's length) independently with fewer parameters than current approaches, learning fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages.

Result: Achieves competitive cross-lingual performance through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including strong zero-shot generalization on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus.

Conclusion: Effective universal speech processing is possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length windows, demonstrating strong cross-lingual generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Universal phoneme recognition typically requires analyzing long speech
segments and language-specific patterns. Many speech processing tasks require
pure phoneme representations free from contextual influence, which motivated
our development of CUPE - a lightweight model that captures key phoneme
features in just 120 milliseconds, about one phoneme's length. CUPE processes
short, fixed-width windows independently and, despite fewer parameters than
current approaches, achieves competitive cross-lingual performance by learning
fundamental acoustic patterns common to all languages. Our extensive evaluation
through supervised and self-supervised training on diverse languages, including
zero-shot tests on the UCLA Phonetic Corpus, demonstrates strong cross-lingual
generalization and reveals that effective universal speech processing is
possible through modeling basic acoustic patterns within phoneme-length
windows.

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes EDAS, a unified meta-metric for Knowledge Graph Completion evaluation that integrates performance across multiple datasets and metrics into a single normalized score to address inconsistent rankings from traditional metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KGC evaluation faces challenges with inconsistent model rankings across different datasets and metrics (MRR, MR, Hit@k), making holistic comparisons difficult and hindering reliable model selection for downstream tasks.

Method: EDAS (Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution) - a robust meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized score (M_i ∈ [0,1]).

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR) demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset performance into a unified ranking, providing consistent and robust evaluation.

Conclusion: EDAS offers a global perspective for KGC model evaluation, enabling more informed model selection, promoting fairness in cross-dataset evaluation, and providing a generalizable framework that addresses the limitations of traditional isolated metrics.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable applications in various domains such as
semantic search, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. KGs
are often incomplete, missing entities and relations, an issue addressed by
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods that predict missing elements.
Different evaluation metrics, such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Mean Rank
(MR), and Hit@k, are commonly used to assess the performance of such KGC
models. A major challenge in evaluating KGC models, however, lies in comparing
their performance across multiple datasets and metrics. A model may outperform
others on one dataset but underperform on another, making it difficult to
determine overall superiority. Moreover, even within a single dataset,
different metrics such as MRR and Hit@1 can yield conflicting rankings, where
one model excels in MRR while another performs better in Hit@1, further
complicating model selection for downstream tasks. These inconsistencies hinder
holistic comparisons and highlight the need for a unified meta-metric that
integrates performance across all metrics and datasets to enable a more
reliable and interpretable evaluation framework. To address this need, we
propose KG Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), a robust
and interpretable meta-metric that synthesizes model performance across
multiple datasets and diverse evaluation criteria into a single normalized
score ($M_i \in [0,1]$). Unlike traditional metrics that focus on isolated
aspects of performance, EDAS offers a global perspective that supports more
informed model selection and promotes fairness in cross-dataset evaluation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets such as FB15k-237 and WN18RR
demonstrate that EDAS effectively integrates multi-metric, multi-dataset
performance into a unified ranking, offering a consistent, robust, and
generalizable framework for evaluating KGC models.

TL;DR: A comprehensive review of 283 LLM benchmarks categorized into general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific types, highlighting issues like data contamination, cultural biases, and lack of process evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid development of large language models, numerous evaluation benchmarks have emerged. This paper aims to systematically review and categorize these benchmarks to provide a clear understanding of current evaluation practices and identify limitations.

Method: The authors systematically reviewed and categorized 283 representative benchmarks into three main categories: general capabilities (linguistics, knowledge, reasoning), domain-specific (natural sciences, humanities, engineering), and target-specific (risks, reliability, agents).

Result: The review identified significant problems including score inflation due to data contamination, unfair evaluation from cultural and linguistic biases, and deficiencies in evaluating process credibility and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: The paper provides a reference design paradigm for future benchmark innovation and calls for addressing current limitations to improve the fairness and effectiveness of LLM evaluation.

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of the depth and breadth of large
language models' capabilities, various corresponding evaluation benchmarks have
been emerging in increasing numbers. As a quantitative assessment tool for
model performance, benchmarks are not only a core means to measure model
capabilities but also a key element in guiding the direction of model
development and promoting technological innovation. We systematically review
the current status and development of large language model benchmarks for the
first time, categorizing 283 representative benchmarks into three categories:
general capabilities, domain-specific, and target-specific. General capability
benchmarks cover aspects such as core linguistics, knowledge, and reasoning;
domain-specific benchmarks focus on fields like natural sciences, humanities
and social sciences, and engineering technology; target-specific benchmarks pay
attention to risks, reliability, agents, etc. We point out that current
benchmarks have problems such as inflated scores caused by data contamination,
unfair evaluation due to cultural and linguistic biases, and lack of evaluation
on process credibility and dynamic environments, and provide a referable design
paradigm for future benchmark innovation.

TL;DR: MultiTrust-X is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating trustworthiness in MLLMs, covering 5 aspects, 2 risk types, and various mitigation strategies across 32 tasks and 28 datasets, revealing significant vulnerabilities and proposing a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation approaches for Multimodal Large Language Models focus on narrow aspects and overlook risks introduced by multimodality, creating concerns about MLLM trustworthiness despite their significant capabilities progress.

Method: Proposed MultiTrust-X benchmark with three-dimensional framework: 5 trustworthiness aspects (truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, privacy), 2 novel risk types (multimodal risks, cross-modal impacts), and various mitigation strategies from data, model architecture, training, and inference perspectives.

Result: Extensive experiments revealed significant vulnerabilities including gap between trustworthiness and general capabilities, amplification of base LLM risks by multimodal training/inference, and limitations in existing mitigation strategies that often introduce unexpected trade-offs compromising model utility.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for future improvements, showing benefits of reasoning for balancing safety and performance, leading to the proposed Reasoning-Enhanced Safety Alignment (RESA) approach that achieves state-of-the-art results by equipping models with chain-of-thought reasoning to discover underlying risks.

Abstract: The trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains an
intense concern despite the significant progress in their capabilities.
Existing evaluation and mitigation approaches often focus on narrow aspects and
overlook risks introduced by the multimodality. To tackle these challenges, we
propose MultiTrust-X, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating, analyzing, and
mitigating the trustworthiness issues of MLLMs. We define a three-dimensional
framework, encompassing five trustworthiness aspects which include
truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy; two novel risk types
covering multimodal risks and cross-modal impacts; and various mitigation
strategies from the perspectives of data, model architecture, training, and
inference algorithms. Based on the taxonomy, MultiTrust-X includes 32 tasks and
28 curated datasets, enabling holistic evaluations over 30 open-source and
proprietary MLLMs and in-depth analysis with 8 representative mitigation
methods. Our extensive experiments reveal significant vulnerabilities in
current models, including a gap between trustworthiness and general
capabilities, as well as the amplification of potential risks in base LLMs by
both multimodal training and inference. Moreover, our controlled analysis
uncovers key limitations in existing mitigation strategies that, while some
methods yield improvements in specific aspects, few effectively address overall
trustworthiness, and many introduce unexpected trade-offs that compromise model
utility. These findings also provide practical insights for future
improvements, such as the benefits of reasoning to better balance safety and
performance. Based on these insights, we introduce a Reasoning-Enhanced Safety
Alignment (RESA) approach that equips the model with chain-of-thought reasoning
ability to discover the underlying risks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: An adaptive speculative decoding method that uses confidence-based uncertainty measures to dynamically adjust drafting length and verification criteria, achieving faster inference while maintaining output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speculative decoding methods use static drafting lengths and rigid verification, which limits adaptability across different model uncertainties and input complexities.

Method: Information-theoretic framework using entropy and margin-based uncertainty measures from the drafter's output distribution to dynamically adjust the number of speculative tokens and modulate verification criteria.

Result: Significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or improving BLEU and ROUGE scores on machine translation and summarization tasks.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled, plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under varying uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating
autoregressive inference by parallelizing token generation through a
draft-then-verify paradigm. However, existing methods rely on static drafting
lengths and rigid verification criteria, limiting their adaptability across
varying model uncertainties and input complexities. This paper proposes an
information-theoretic framework for speculative decoding based on
confidence-modulated drafting. By leveraging entropy and margin-based
uncertainty measures over the drafter's output distribution, the proposed
method dynamically adjusts the number of speculatively generated tokens at each
iteration. This adaptive mechanism reduces rollback frequency, improves
resource utilization, and maintains output fidelity. Additionally, the
verification process is modulated using the same confidence signals, enabling
more flexible acceptance of drafted tokens without sacrificing generation
quality. Experiments on machine translation and summarization tasks demonstrate
significant speedups over standard speculative decoding while preserving or
improving BLEU and ROUGE scores. The proposed approach offers a principled,
plug-in method for efficient and robust decoding in large language models under
varying conditions of uncertainty.

### [29] [Exploiting Vocabulary Frequency Imbalance in Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15390)
*Woojin Chung,Jeonghoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Larger vocabularies help language models by reducing the complexity of tokenized text rather than through better word coverage, with benefits mainly coming from improved performance on frequent words despite increased token-frequency imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why larger vocabularies benefit language models, given that common words are already single tokens in smaller vocabularies and larger vocabularies mainly deepen token-frequency imbalance.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments scaling vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and optimization fixed. Analyzed complexity via Kolmogorov complexity, performed word-level loss decomposition, and constrained embedding norms to test effects of token-frequency imbalance.

Result: Larger vocabularies reduce cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most frequent words, even though loss on rare words increases. The model exploits rather than suffers from token-frequency imbalance, and this benefit transfers to downstream benchmarks covering ~77% of tokens.

Conclusion: The benefit of larger vocabularies comes from lowering the complexity of tokenized text, not better word coverage. This provides a principled approach for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifies loss dynamics in language model scaling.

Abstract: Large language models are trained with tokenizers, and the resulting token
distribution is highly imbalanced: a few words dominate the stream while most
occur rarely. Recent practice favors ever-larger vocabularies, but the source
of the benefit is unclear. We conduct a controlled study that scales the
language model's vocabulary from 24K to 196K while holding data, compute, and
optimization fixed. We first quantify the complexity of tokenized text,
formalized via Kolmogorov complexity, and show that larger vocabularies reduce
this complexity. Above 24K, every common word is already a single token, so
further growth mainly deepens the relative token-frequency imbalance. A
word-level loss decomposition shows that larger vocabularies reduce
cross-entropy almost exclusively by lowering uncertainty on the 2,500 most
frequent words, even though loss on the rare tail rises. Constraining input and
output embedding norms to attenuate the effect of token-frequency imbalance
reverses the gain, directly showing that the model exploits rather than suffers
from imbalance. Because the same frequent words cover roughly 77% of tokens in
downstream benchmarks, this training advantage transfers intact. We also show
that enlarging model parameters with a fixed vocabulary yields the same
frequent-word benefit. Our results reframe "bigger vocabularies help" as
"lowering the complexity of tokenized text helps," providing a simple,
principled lever for tokenizer-model co-design and clarifying the loss dynamics
that govern language-model scaling in pre-training.

*Cheng Wang,Gelei Deng,Xianglin Yang,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LALMs show significant text bias when processing conflicting audio-text inputs, leading to performance degradation in audio tasks. MCR-BENCH benchmark reveals this issue and explores mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) can process multimodal audio-text inputs, but their handling of conflicting information between modalities remains unexamined, raising reliability concerns for real-world applications.

Method: Introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate LALMs' information prioritization with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Evaluates across diverse audio understanding tasks and investigates text bias factors, mitigation through supervised finetuning, and model confidence patterns.

Result: LALMs display significant bias toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence when inconsistencies exist. This leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks. Models show persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs.

Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for improved modality balance during training and more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance robustness when handling conflicting multimodal inputs. The benchmark provides a foundation for addressing these reliability issues.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are enhanced with audio perception
capabilities, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal
inputs that combine audio and text. However, their performance in handling
conflicting information between audio and text modalities remains largely
unexamined. This paper introduces MCR-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate how LALMs prioritize information when
presented with inconsistent audio-text pairs. Through extensive evaluation
across diverse audio understanding tasks, we reveal a concerning phenomenon:
when inconsistencies exist between modalities, LALMs display a significant bias
toward textual input, frequently disregarding audio evidence. This tendency
leads to substantial performance degradation in audio-centric tasks and raises
important reliability concerns for real-world applications. We further
investigate the influencing factors of text bias, and explore mitigation
strategies through supervised finetuning, and analyze model confidence patterns
that reveal persistent overconfidence even with contradictory inputs. These
findings underscore the need for improved modality balance during training and
more sophisticated fusion mechanisms to enhance the robustness when handling
conflicting multi-modal inputs. The project is available at

Motivation: Address fragmented architectures and lack of transparency in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) by providing open resources for systematic comparison and reproducibility, unlike current practices of releasing weights without training data and configurations.

Method: Introduces LLaSO framework with three components: LLaSO-Align (12M speech-text alignment corpus), LLaSO-Instruct (13.5M multi-task instruction-tuning dataset), and LLaSO-Eval (reproducible benchmark). Builds LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter model trained exclusively on public data.

Result: LLaSO-Base achieves normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Analysis shows broader training coverage enhances performance but significant generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, especially in pure audio scenarios.

Conclusion: LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs by releasing complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models, addressing critical transparency and reproducibility gaps in the field.

Abstract: The development of Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs) has been slowed by
fragmented architectures and a lack of transparency, hindering the systematic
comparison and reproducibility of research. Unlike in the vision-language
domain, the LSLM field suffers from the common practice of releasing model
weights without their corresponding training data and configurations. To
address these critical gaps, we introduce LLaSO, the first fully open,
end-to-end framework for large-scale speech-language modeling. LLaSO provides
the community with three essential resources: (1) LLaSO-Align, a 12M-instance
speech-text alignment corpus; (2) LLaSO-Instruct, a 13.5M-instance multi-task
instruction-tuning dataset; and (3) LLaSO-Eval, a reproducible benchmark for
standardized evaluation. To validate our framework, we build and release
LLaSO-Base, a 3.8B-parameter reference model trained exclusively on our public
data. It achieves a normalized score of 0.72, establishing a strong,
reproducible baseline that surpasses comparable models. Our analysis reveals
that while broader training coverage enhances performance, significant
generalization gaps persist on unseen tasks, particularly in pure audio
scenarios. By releasing the complete stack of data, benchmarks, and models,
LLaSO establishes a foundational open standard to unify research efforts and
accelerate community-driven progress in LSLMs. We release the code, dataset,
pretrained models, and results in https://github.com/EIT-NLP/LLaSO.

*Mohammad Ibrahim Qani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This research paper explores methods for translating non-equivalent words between languages, focusing on cultural and traditional terms that lack direct equivalents, with examples from Dari/Uzbek to English/Russian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address translation challenges caused by non-equivalent words in different languages, particularly cultural, traditional, food, and garment terms that create misunderstandings between languages.

Method: Library-based research analyzing different translation methods and rules for rendering non-equivalent words from source to target languages.

Result: The paper presents various professional translation methods and successfully rendered 25 non-equivalent words from Dari and Uzbek languages into English and Russian.

Conclusion: Effective translation of non-equivalent words requires specialized methods and rules, and there remains significant work to be done in rendering culturally-specific terms across languages.

Abstract: These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge
where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate
misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words
because there are different local and internal words like food, garment,
cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these
words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be
worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the
both languages. The purpose of this research is to introduce the methods of
rendering non-equivalent words professionally from the source language to the
target language and this research has been completed using library-based
research. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already
professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words
to be rendered. As a result, this research paper includes different ways and
rules of rendering non-equivalent words from source language to the target
language and 25 non-equvalent words have been rendered from Dar & Uzbek into
English and Russian languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programmable task-oriented dialogue agents require accurate state tracking, but existing approaches have limitations in effectiveness and error correction capabilities.

Method: PyTOD generates executable code to track dialogue state and employs constrained decoding using a language model (instead of grammar rules) to follow API schemata, with policy and execution feedback for error correction.

Result: PyTOD achieves state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD benchmark, surpassing strong baselines in both accuracy and robust user goal estimation as dialogues progress.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking for programmable task-oriented dialogue agents.

Abstract: Programmable task-oriented dialogue (TOD) agents enable language models to
follow structured dialogue policies, but their effectiveness hinges on accurate
state tracking. We present PyTOD, an agent that generates executable code to
track dialogue state and uses policy and execution feedback for efficient error
correction. To this end, PyTOD employs a simple constrained decoding approach,
using a language model instead of grammar rules to follow API schemata. This
leads to state-of-the-art state tracking performance on the challenging SGD
benchmark. Our experiments show that PyTOD surpasses strong baselines in both
accuracy and robust user goal estimation as the dialogue progresses,
demonstrating the effectiveness of execution-aware state tracking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RadReason is a novel evaluation framework for radiology reports that provides fine-grained sub-scores across six clinically defined error types with human-readable justifications, outperforming existing methods and achieving parity with GPT-4 while being more explainable and cost-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for automatically generated radiology reports are limited to coarse overall scores or rely on opaque black-box models, which restricts their usefulness in real-world clinical workflows where interpretable and clinically grounded metrics are needed.

Method: Builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization with two key innovations: (1) Sub-score Dynamic Weighting that adaptively prioritizes clinically challenging error types based on live F1 statistics, and (2) Majority-Guided Advantage Scaling that adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt difficulty derived from sub-score agreement.

Result: Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations while remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: RadReason provides a clinically grounded, interpretable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for radiology reports that addresses the limitations of existing methods and demonstrates strong performance comparable to state-of-the-art while being more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Evaluating automatically generated radiology reports remains a fundamental
challenge due to the lack of clinically grounded, interpretable, and
fine-grained metrics. Existing methods either produce coarse overall scores or
rely on opaque black-box models, limiting their usefulness in real-world
clinical workflows. We introduce RadReason, a novel evaluation framework for
radiology reports that not only outputs fine-grained sub-scores across six
clinically defined error types, but also produces human-readable justifications
that explain the rationale behind each score. Our method builds on Group
Relative Policy Optimization and incorporates two key innovations: (1)
Sub-score Dynamic Weighting, which adaptively prioritizes clinically
challenging error types based on live F1 statistics; and (2) Majority-Guided
Advantage Scaling, which adjusts policy gradient updates based on prompt
difficulty derived from sub-score agreement. Together, these components enable
more stable optimization and better alignment with expert clinical judgment.
Experiments on the ReXVal benchmark show that RadReason surpasses all prior
offline metrics and achieves parity with GPT-4-based evaluations, while
remaining explainable, cost-efficient, and suitable for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: SLM4Offer is a generative AI model for personalized offer generation using contrastive learning with T5-Small, achieving 17% improvement in offer acceptance rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized marketing can boost revenue by up to 40%, but current efforts focus mainly on recommendations and ads, leaving personalized offer generation underexplored despite its potential for conversion rates and customer satisfaction.

Method: Fine-tuned Google's T5-Small (60M) encoder-decoder model using contrastive learning with InfoNCE loss to align customer personas with relevant offers in shared embedding space, trained on synthetic customer behavior dataset.

Result: 17% improvement in offer acceptance rate compared to supervised fine-tuning baseline, demonstrating enhanced generalizability through adaptive learning behavior from contrastive loss.

Conclusion: Contrastive learning objectives effectively advance personalized marketing by reshaping latent space during training, making SLM4Offer a promising approach for data-driven personalized offer generation.

Abstract: Personalized marketing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing
customer engagement and driving business growth. Academic and industry efforts
have predominantly focused on recommendation systems and personalized
advertisements. Nonetheless, this facet of personalization holds significant
potential for increasing conversion rates and improving customer satisfaction.
Prior studies suggest that well-executed personalization strategies can boost
revenue by up to 40 percent, underscoring the strategic importance of
developing intelligent, data-driven approaches for offer generation. This work
introduces SLM4Offer, a generative AI model for personalized offer generation,
developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained encoder-decoder language model,
specifically Google's Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5-Small 60M) using a
contrastive learning approach. SLM4Offer employs InfoNCE (Information
Noise-Contrastive Estimation) loss to align customer personas with relevant
offers in a shared embedding space. A key innovation in SLM4Offer lies in the
adaptive learning behaviour introduced by contrastive loss, which reshapes the
latent space during training and enhances the model's generalizability. The
model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a synthetic dataset designed to simulate
customer behaviour and offer acceptance patterns. Experimental results
demonstrate a 17 percent improvement in offer acceptance rate over a supervised
fine-tuning baseline, highlighting the effectiveness of contrastive objectives
in advancing personalized marketing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small LMs with page-level tokenizers outperform large LMs for browsing behavior modeling, and cluster-specific training (HeTLM) achieves better performance and alignment than single LMs for heterogeneous user behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception that large language models are universally better, particularly for subjective user behaviors like browsing patterns which form individual "languages" without natural language structure.

Method: Proposed HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model) using clusterwise training with page-level tokenizers and heterogeneous cluster-specific parameters instead of a single LM approach.

Result: Small LMs with page-level tokenizers outperform large pretrained/finetuned LMs; HeTLM with cluster-specific parameters outperforms single LMs with same parameter count; achieves higher mean and lower variance in generation performance.

Conclusion: Cluster-specific training approach (HeTLM) provides better representation of subjective browsing behaviors and improved user-level alignment compared to single large language models.

Abstract: A Large Language Model (LLM) offers versatility across domains and tasks,
purportedly benefiting users with a wide variety of behaviors and preferences.
We question this perception about an LLM when users have inherently subjective
behaviors and preferences, as seen in their ubiquitous and idiosyncratic
browsing of websites or apps. The sequential behavior logs of pages, thus
generated, form something akin to each user's self-constructed "language",
albeit without the structure and grammar imbued in natural languages. We ask:
(i) Can a small LM represent the "language of browsing" better than a large LM?
(ii) Can an LM with a single set of parameters (or, single LM) adequately
capture myriad users' heterogeneous, subjective behaviors and preferences?
(iii) Can a single LM with high average performance, yield low variance in
performance to make alignment good at user level? We introduce clusterwise LM
training, HeTLM (Heterogeneity aware Training of Language Model), appropriate
for subjective behaviors. We find that (i) a small LM trained using a
page-level tokenizer outperforms large pretrained or finetuned LMs; (ii) HeTLM
with heterogeneous cluster specific set of parameters outperforms a single LM
of the same family, controlling for the number of parameters; and (iii) a
higher mean and a lower variance in generation ensues, implying improved
alignment.

*Loris Schoenegger,Lukas Thoma,Terra Blevins,Benjamin Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Curriculum learning using model-centric difficulty metrics (training data influence) instead of human-centered metrics improves language model pre-training by over 10 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional curriculum learning with human-centered difficulty metrics has shown limited success for pre-training language models. The authors investigate whether using model-centric difficulty metrics that better reflect actual training challenges would make curriculum learning more effective.

Method: The researchers replaced conventional difficulty metrics with training data influence scores, which estimate the effect of individual training examples on model output. They sorted training examples by this model-centric difficulty metric and trained language models using this curriculum.

Result: Models trained with the curriculum based on training data influence outperformed models trained with random ordering by over 10 percentage points in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Curriculum learning is beneficial for language model pre-training when using model-centric difficulty notions rather than human-centered metrics, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Curriculum learning, a training technique where data is presented to the
model in order of example difficulty (e.g., from simpler to more complex
documents), has shown limited success for pre-training language models. In this
work, we investigate whether curriculum learning becomes competitive if we
replace conventional human-centered difficulty metrics with one that more
closely corresponds to example difficulty as observed during model training.
Specifically, we experiment with sorting training examples by their
\textit{training data influence}, a score which estimates the effect of
individual training examples on the model's output. Models trained on our
curricula are able to outperform ones trained in random order by over 10
percentage points in benchmarks, confirming that curriculum learning is
beneficial for language model pre-training, as long as a more model-centric
notion of difficulty is adopted.

*Guy Mor-Lan,Naama Rivlin-Angert,Yael R. Kaplan,Tamir Sheafer,Shaul R. Shenhav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HebID is the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social identity detection, featuring 5,536 annotated sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts with 12 nuanced identity categories, achieving best results with Hebrew-tuned LLMs (F1=0.74).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing identity detection datasets are predominantly English-centric, single-label, and use coarse identity categories, lacking nuanced multilingual approaches for political language analysis.

Method: Created HebID corpus with manual annotations of Israeli politicians' Facebook posts (2018-2021) for 12 social identities, benchmarked multilabel/single-label encoders and Hebrew-tuned LLMs (2B-9B parameters).

Result: Hebrew-tuned LLMs achieved best performance (macro-F1=0.74). Analysis revealed differences in popularity, temporal trends, clustering patterns, and gender variations in identity expression across Facebook posts and parliamentary speeches.

Conclusion: HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying social identities in Hebrew and serves as a model for similar research in other non-English political contexts, enabling comparison between elite discourse and public identity priorities.

Abstract: Political language is deeply intertwined with social identities. While social
identities are often shaped by specific cultural contexts and expressed through
particular uses of language, existing datasets for group and identity detection
are predominantly English-centric, single-label and focus on coarse identity
categories. We introduce HebID, the first multilabel Hebrew corpus for social
identity detection: 5,536 sentences from Israeli politicians' Facebook posts
(Dec 2018-Apr 2021), manually annotated for twelve nuanced social identities
(e.g. Rightist, Ultra-Orthodox, Socially-oriented) grounded by survey data. We
benchmark multilabel and single-label encoders alongside 2B-9B-parameter
generative LLMs, finding that Hebrew-tuned LLMs provide the best results
(macro-$F_1$ = 0.74). We apply our classifier to politicians' Facebook posts
and parliamentary speeches, evaluating differences in popularity, temporal
trends, clustering patterns, and gender-related variations in identity
expression. We utilize identity choices from a national public survey, enabling
a comparison between identities portrayed in elite discourse and the public's
identity priorities. HebID provides a comprehensive foundation for studying
social identities in Hebrew and can serve as a model for similar research in
other non-English political contexts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study political delegitimization discourse - symbolic attacks on the normative validity of political entities - through computational methods to understand patterns and trends in democratic discourse.

Method: Curated and annotated a Hebrew corpus of 10,410 sentences from Knesset speeches, Facebook posts, and news outlets. Developed a two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and decoder LLMs (DictaLM 2.0).

Result: Best model achieved F1 of 0.74 for binary PDD detection and macro-F1 of 0.67 for classification characteristics. Analysis revealed rising PDD over 30 years, higher prevalence on social media, greater use by male politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors, with spikes during elections.

Conclusion: Automated PDD analysis is feasible and valuable for understanding democratic discourse, demonstrating computational methods can effectively detect and analyze political delegitimization patterns across platforms and time periods.

Abstract: We present the first large-scale computational study of political
delegitimization discourse (PDD), defined as symbolic attacks on the normative
validity of political entities. We curate and manually annotate a novel
Hebrew-language corpus of 10,410 sentences drawn from Knesset speeches
(1993-2023), Facebook posts (2018-2021), and leading news outlets, of which
1,812 instances (17.4\%) exhibit PDD and 642 carry additional annotations for
intensity, incivility, target type, and affective framing. We introduce a
two-stage classification pipeline combining finetuned encoder models and
decoder LLMs. Our best model (DictaLM 2.0) attains an F$_1$ of 0.74 for binary
PDD detection and a macro-F$_1$ of 0.67 for classification of delegitimization
characteristics. Applying this classifier to longitudinal and cross-platform
data, we see a marked rise in PDD over three decades, higher prevalence on
social media versus parliamentary debate, greater use by male than female
politicians, and stronger tendencies among right-leaning actors - with
pronounced spikes during election campaigns and major political events. Our
findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of automated PDD analysis for
understanding democratic discourse.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SDGO is a reinforcement learning framework that uses LLMs' own discrimination capabilities as reward signals to enhance generation safety without additional data or external models, achieving robust performance against jailbreaking attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content generation, and there's a safety inconsistency where models can better identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators.

Method: Proposes SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal for iterative self-improvement of generation safety.

Result: SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks, and shows robust performance against out-of-distribution jailbreaking attacks.

Conclusion: Aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities through SDGO enables tighter coupling between these capabilities, allowing generation capability to be enhanced with only small amounts of discriminative samples.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content
generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can
more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend
against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the
model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we
propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement
learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities
as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative
self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or
external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and
training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks.
By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings
robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This
alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling
the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small
amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual survey creation is becoming infeasible due to rapid growth of academic literature, but progress in automated survey generation is hindered by lack of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.

Method: Introduces SurGE benchmark with test instances (topic descriptions, expert-written surveys, cited references) and large academic corpus. Proposes automated evaluation framework across four dimensions: information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and content quality.

Result: Evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows survey generation remains highly challenging even for advanced self-reflection frameworks, highlighting task complexity.

Conclusion: Scientific survey generation is a complex task requiring continued research. The SurGE benchmark provides standardized evaluation and all resources are open-sourced to facilitate future work.

Abstract: Scientific survey articles play a vital role in summarizing research
progress, yet their manual creation is becoming increasingly infeasible due to
the rapid growth of academic literature. While large language models (LLMs)
offer promising capabilities for automating this process, progress in this area
is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols.
To address this gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new
benchmark for evaluating scientific survey generation in the computer science
domain. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a
topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited
references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers
that serves as the retrieval pool. In addition, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that measures generated surveys across four dimensions:
information coverage, referencing accuracy, structural organization, and
content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based approaches shows that
survey generation remains highly challenging, even for advanced self-reflection
frameworks. These findings highlight the complexity of the task and the
necessity for continued research. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pos2Distill is a knowledge distillation framework that transfers capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones to mitigate positional bias in long-context processing, achieving improved uniformity and performance across all contextual positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias significantly impairs long-context comprehension and processing capabilities, and prior mitigation approaches through architectural modifications still leave significant bias persisting.

Method: Introduces Pos2Distill, a position-to-position knowledge distillation framework with two specialized instantiations: Pos2Distill-R¹ for retrieval tasks and Pos2Distill-R² for reasoning tasks, leveraging position-induced disparity to counteract positional bias itself.

Result: Achieves enhanced uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks, with strong cross-task generalization between the specialized systems.

Conclusion: The Pos2Distill framework effectively addresses positional bias by transferring superior capabilities from advantageous to less favorable positions, resulting in improved performance and uniformity across long-context processing tasks.

Abstract: Positional bias (PB), manifesting as non-uniform sensitivity across different
contextual locations, significantly impairs long-context comprehension and
processing capabilities. While prior work seeks to mitigate PB through
modifying the architectures causing its emergence, significant PB still
persists. To address PB effectively, we introduce \textbf{Pos2Distill}, a
position to position knowledge distillation framework. Pos2Distill transfers
the superior capabilities from advantageous positions to less favorable ones,
thereby reducing the huge performance gaps. The conceptual principle is to
leverage the inherent, position-induced disparity to counteract the PB itself.
We identify distinct manifestations of PB under \textbf{\textsc{r}}etrieval and
\textbf{\textsc{r}}easoning paradigms, thereby designing two specialized
instantiations: \emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{1}} and
\emph{Pos2Distill-R\textsuperscript{2}} respectively, both grounded in this
core principle. By employing the Pos2Distill approach, we achieve enhanced
uniformity and significant performance gains across all contextual positions in
long-context retrieval and reasoning tasks. Crucially, both specialized systems
exhibit strong cross-task generalization mutually, while achieving superior
performance on their respective tasks.

TL;DR: Survey paper on Bangla stemming approaches highlighting resource scarcity, methodological gaps, and need for better evaluation metrics and implementations for this low-resource language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla faces digital under-representation with limited resources and annotated datasets, making stemming crucial for reducing algorithmic complexity in this highly-inflectional language.

Method: Comprehensive survey of existing Bangla stemming approaches, analyzing literature gaps, implementation accessibility, and evaluation methodologies.

Result: Identifies significant research discontinuity, scarcity of replicable implementations, and inadequate evaluation metrics in current Bangla stemming research.

Conclusion: Advocates for robust Bangla stemmer development with improved methodologies and continued research to enhance language processing for this widely spoken but under-resourced language.

Abstract: Bangla, the seventh most widely spoken language worldwide with 300 million
native speakers, faces digital under-representation due to limited resources
and lack of annotated datasets. Stemming, a critical preprocessing step in
language analysis, is essential for low-resource, highly-inflectional languages
like Bangla, because it can reduce the complexity of algorithms and models by
significantly reducing the number of words the algorithm needs to consider.
This paper conducts a comprehensive survey of stemming approaches, emphasizing
the importance of handling morphological variants effectively. While exploring
the landscape of Bangla stemming, it becomes evident that there is a
significant gap in the existing literature. The paper highlights the
discontinuity from previous research and the scarcity of accessible
implementations for replication. Furthermore, it critiques the evaluation
methodologies, stressing the need for more relevant metrics. In the context of
Bangla's rich morphology and diverse dialects, the paper acknowledges the
challenges it poses. To address these challenges, the paper suggests directions
for Bangla stemmer development. It concludes by advocating for robust Bangla
stemmers and continued research in the field to enhance language analysis and
processing.

TL;DR: EcomMMMU dataset reveals product images don't always improve MLLM performance in e-commerce tasks, sometimes degrading it. Proposed SUMEI method strategically uses images by predicting visual utilities first.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets are limited in scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine whether product images enhance or degrade understanding in e-commerce multimodal tasks.

Method: Introduced EcomMMMU dataset with 406,190 samples and 8.9M images across 8 tasks, then proposed SUMEI - a data-driven method that predicts visual utilities before using images for downstream tasks.

Result: Analysis showed product images do not consistently improve performance and can sometimes degrade it, indicating MLLMs struggle to effectively leverage visual content. SUMEI demonstrated effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments.

Conclusion: MLLMs may not effectively utilize rich visual content for e-commerce tasks, and strategic image selection through utility prediction (SUMEI) is needed for optimal performance.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rich in multimodal data, featuring a variety of
images that depict product details. However, this raises an important question:
do these images always enhance product understanding, or can they sometimes
introduce redundancy or degrade performance? Existing datasets are limited in
both scale and design, making it difficult to systematically examine this
question. To this end, we introduce EcomMMMU, an e-commerce multimodal
multitask understanding dataset with 406,190 samples and 8,989,510 images.
EcomMMMU is comprised of multi-image visual-language data designed with 8
essential tasks and a specialized VSS subset to benchmark the capability of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively utilize visual content.
Analysis on EcomMMMU reveals that product images do not consistently improve
performance and can, in some cases, degrade it. This indicates that MLLMs may
struggle to effectively leverage rich visual content for e-commerce tasks.
Building on these insights, we propose SUMEI, a data-driven method that
strategically utilizes multiple images via predicting visual utilities before
using them for downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SUMEI. The data and code are available through

Motivation: Medical LLMs suffer from knowledge gaps and hallucinations, and current retrieval-augmented methods have limited impact due to weak external knowledge utilization and poor feedback-reasoning traceability.

Method: End-to-end reinforcement learning training framework with tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure, and diagnostic accuracy, using a large-scale medical retrieval corpus as the environment.

Result: Substantially outperforms GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical frameworks in diagnostic accuracy for both common and rare diseases in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: The approach provides more reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses with improved interpretability, demonstrating the effectiveness of agentic RL training for medical RAG systems.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis with medical large language models is hindered by
knowledge gaps and hallucinations. Retrieval and tool-augmented methods help,
but their impact is limited by weak use of external knowledge and poor
feedback-reasoning traceability. To address these challenges, We introduce
Deep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement
learning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for
medical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical
retrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge
sources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More
crutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its
environment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,
and diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from
large-scale data through RL.
  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework
consistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches
across multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic
baselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks
for both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and
out-of-distribution settings. Moreover, ablation studies on reward design and
retrieval corpus components confirm their critical roles, underscoring the
uniqueness and effectiveness of our approach compared with traditional
implementations. Finally, case studies and interpretability analyses highlight
improvements in Deep-DxSearch's diagnostic policy, providing deeper insight
into its performance gains and supporting clinicians in delivering more
reliable and precise preliminary diagnoses. See

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning tasks
through methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often fall
short in tasks requiring precise computations. Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)
has emerged as a solution by incorporating external tools into the reasoning
process. Nevertheless, the generalization of TIR in improving the reasoning
ability of LLM is still unclear. Additionally, whether TIR has improved the
model's reasoning behavior and helped the model think remains to be studied. We
introduce ReasonZoo, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing nine diverse
reasoning categories, to evaluate the effectiveness of TIR across various

*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an alternative to Soft-argmax for facial landmark detection, achieving faster convergence and state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heatmap regression methods for facial landmark detection rely on Soft-argmax as a differentiable approximation of argmax, but this may not be the optimal approach. The authors aim to explore alternative training objectives.

Method: The authors propose a training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework as an alternative to Soft-argmax for end-to-end training of deep networks in facial landmark detection.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converges 2.2x faster during training, and maintains competitive or better accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Soft-argmax is not the only effective approach for facial landmark detection; structured prediction-based training objectives can provide superior performance with faster convergence, offering a viable alternative to the long-standing Soft-argmax method.

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: YOPO is a single-stage RGB-only framework that unifies object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation using a transformer detector with lightweight pose head, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at category level without relying on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation.

Method: Single-stage query-based framework using transformer detector with lightweight pose head, bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. Trained end-to-end only with RGB images and category-level pose labels.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on three benchmarks. On REAL275: 79.6% IoU50 and 54.1% under 10°10cm metric, surpassing prior RGB-only methods and closing gap to RGB-D systems.

Conclusion: YOPO demonstrates that object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation can be unified with high performance using only RGB images, without additional data requirements.

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework for detecting both physical and digital face spoofing attacks using paired contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional face recognition systems use separate models for physical and digital spoofing detection, which increases complexity, latency, and vulnerability to combined attacks.

Method: Proposes Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework that uses automatically matched pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues through contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves 2.10% average classification error rate (ACER) on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge benchmark, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework effectively handles both physical and digital spoofing attacks with high accuracy and efficiency, making it practical for real-world deployment in face recognition systems.

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at

*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen is a training-free black-box adversarial attack method that uses diffusion models with only 3-20 sampling steps, achieving high attack success rates while maintaining image quality and being 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models need hundreds of sampling steps for adversarial generation, making them inefficient.

Method: TAIGen injects perturbations during the mixing step interval without processing all timesteps. It uses a selective RGB channel strategy: attention maps on red channel and GradCAM-guided perturbations on green and blue channels to preserve structure while maximizing misclassification.

Result: TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR >30 dB. On ImageNet with VGGNet source: 70.6% success vs ResNet, 80.8% vs MNASNet, 97.8% vs ShuffleNet. Generates adversarial examples 10x faster than existing diffusion-based attacks and achieves the lowest robust accuracy.

Conclusion: TAIGen provides an efficient and effective training-free black-box adversarial attack method that significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining high attack success rates and image quality.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++ is a reversible unfolding network with generative refinement that addresses concealed visual perception by combining reversible modeling across mask and RGB domains with a targeted diffusion model for uncertainty refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVP methods are limited to mask domain reversible strategies and don't fully exploit RGB domain potential, leaving uncertainty issues unresolved.

Method: Formulates CVP as optimization problem, unfolds iterative solution into multi-stage network with three modules: CORE (mask domain reversible modeling), CARE (RGB domain extension), and FINE (targeted Bernoulli diffusion for uncertain regions).

Result: Provides efficient uncertainty mitigation with reduced computational cost compared to full-image diffusion processes, significantly reducing false positives and negatives.

Conclusion: RUN++ introduces a novel synergy between unfolding networks and diffusion models, creating a robust CVP framework effective under real-world degradations through bi-level optimization.

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

TL;DR: CurveFlow introduces curvature-aware flow matching with non-linear trajectories to improve semantic alignment in text-to-image generation, outperforming linear rectified flow models on semantic consistency metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear trajectories in existing rectified flow models force generation through low-probability regions, potentially harming semantic alignment between generated images and text captions. The relationship between trajectory curvature and instructional compliance remains underexplored.

Method: Proposes CurveFlow framework that learns smooth non-linear trajectories by incorporating curvature guidance into flow paths. Uses robust curvature regularization to penalize abrupt changes in trajectory dynamics.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on MS COCO 2014 and 2017 datasets, significantly outperforming standard rectified flow variants and non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. Shows substantial improvements in semantic consistency metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CLAIR) while maintaining high image quality.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex instructions in text-to-image generation, confirming that non-linear trajectories improve semantic alignment compared to linear approaches.

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is

TL;DR: HiRQA is a self-supervised, opinion-unaware NR-IQA framework that uses hierarchical ranking and quality alignment to predict image quality scores without pristine references or auxiliary modalities at inference time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels hinder the generalization performance of existing no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) methods.

Method: Combines ranking and contrastive learning with a novel higher-order ranking loss for relational ordering across distortion pairs, embedding distance loss for feature-perception consistency, and training-time contrastive alignment with structured textual prompts.

Result: HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations (lens flare, haze, motion blur, low-light) despite being trained only on synthetic distortions. HiRQA-S variant achieves 3.5 ms inference time per image for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: Extensive experiments validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization ability, and scalability across synthetic and authentic benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management for reliable multi-view 3D reconstruction in dynamic edge environments with spatiotemporally correlated disruptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications in emergency response and tactical scenarios require near-real-time performance in dynamic edge environments, but suffer from reliability issues due to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions that degrade reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes a portfolio theory-inspired edge resource management strategy using genetic algorithm optimization to solve the camera selection problem, ensuring reliable reconstruction despite disruptions.

Result: The proposed camera selection strategy demonstrates benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction compared to traditional baseline strategies under spatiotemporal disruptions, using both publicly available and customized 3D datasets.

Conclusion: The portfolio-theoretic approach provides an effective solution for maintaining reconstruction quality in dynamic edge environments with correlated disruptions, with genetic algorithm offering quick convergence for realistic system settings.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM successfully bridges the gap between automated diagnosis and clinical needs by providing robust, interpretable insights through natural language explanations, making it suitable for clinical adoption in diabetic retinopathy diagnosis.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

TL;DR: MeSS generates high-quality, style-consistent outdoor scenes using city mesh models as geometric prior, combining image diffusion models with 3D Gaussian Splatting for improved cross-view consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: City mesh models lack realistic textures, limiting their use in virtual urban navigation and autonomous driving. Existing diffusion models struggle with 3D scene generation and cross-view consistency.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Generate geometrically consistent sparse views with Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets, 2) Propagate denser views with AGInpaint, 3) Eliminate visual inconsistencies with GCAlign module. Reconstruct 3D Gaussian Splatting scene from mesh surface.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment and generation quality. Enables diverse style rendering through relighting and style transfer.

Conclusion: MeSS successfully addresses texture generation for city mesh models, providing high-quality, consistent 3D scenes suitable for virtual navigation and autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Motivation: In safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, it's crucial to properly model rule-based surrounding agents to ensure optimal behavior and safety. Existing approaches use various behavior modeling strategies and IDM models, but there's a need to test these models against adversarial scenarios.

Method: The paper presents a learning-based method to derive adversarial behavior for rule-based agents. This approach creates failure scenarios by training adversarial agents that can exploit weaknesses in the rule-based models.

Result: The adversarial agent was evaluated against all rule-based agents and demonstrated a significant decrease in cumulative reward, indicating successful creation of failure scenarios that compromise the performance of rule-based systems.

Conclusion: The learning-based adversarial approach effectively identifies vulnerabilities in rule-based agent models, providing valuable insights for improving the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in critical applications like autonomous driving.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a
learning based method to derive the adversarial behavior for the rule based
agents to cause failure scenarios. We evaluate our adversarial agent against
all the rule based agents and show the decrease in cumulative reward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing renal pathology datasets and methods only provide binary semantic masks, limiting precision for downstream morphological analysis of functional units that require instance-level segmentation.

Method: Integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations in a unified framework with adaptive geometric refinement and class-specific hyperparameter tuning through systematic parameter optimization.

Result: Outperforms individual classical approaches and naive combinations, robustly separating adherent and heterogeneous structures in binary masks for superior instance separation.

Conclusion: Enables more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows by providing precise instance-level segmentation from binary masks, with the pipeline publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a cost-effective accident prediction system using only dash-cam video input, which is more challenging but easier to deploy than sensor-based systems like LiDAR, radar, and GPS.

Method: Incorporates better spatio-temporal features and aggregates them through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos.

Result: Achieves higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous methods on three publicly available datasets, both in cross-validation and cross-dataset testing scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed STAGNet model provides an effective and deployable solution for accident prediction using only dash-cam video, demonstrating superior performance over existing graph neural network approaches.

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generative models operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms, overlooking the complementary benefits of multi-modality data (RGB images for textures, point clouds for geometry) and limiting training dataset scope.

Method: 1) Collaborative multi-modal coding integrates modality-specific features while preserving their unique strengths. 2) Auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision enhances robustness. 3) Triplane latent diffusion model generates 3D assets from embedded multi-modal codes.

Result: Extensive experiments show TriMM achieves competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets despite using small training data. Additional RGB-D dataset experiments verify feasibility of incorporating other multi-modal datasets.

Conclusion: TriMM successfully harnesses multi-modalities for 3D modeling, demonstrating that effective multi-modal integration enables high-quality 3D generation with limited data, opening possibilities for broader multi-modal dataset utilization.

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

### [71] [Center-Oriented Prototype Contrastive Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15231)
*Shihao Dong,Xiaotong Zhou,Yuhui Zheng,Huiying Xu,Xinzhong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework that uses soft prototypes with probability weighting to reduce inter-class conflicts and prototype drift, combined with dual consistency learning for better feature alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for clustering suffer from class conflict problems and deviations between hard prototypes and true cluster centers, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a framework with: 1) Soft prototype contrastive module using sample-to-center probability as weights to calculate category prototypes, 2) Dual consistency learning module that aligns different transformations of same samples and neighborhoods of different samples.

Result: Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses prototype drift and inter-class conflicts in contrastive clustering, providing reliable prototype calculation and improved clustering performance.

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DuAl-VLN task with two UAVs at different altitudes collaborating for aerial vision-language navigation, introduces HaL-13k dataset, and develops AeroDuo framework for efficient dual-UAV cooperation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage UAVs' high mobility for multi-grained perspectives while managing complex motion space challenges in aerial VLN, reducing need for human intervention or overly detailed instructions.

Method: Introduces dual-UAV collaborative approach: high-altitude UAV uses multimodal LLM (Pilot-LLM) for environmental reasoning, low-altitude UAV uses lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and target grounding, with minimal coordinate exchange.

Result: Develops HaL-13k dataset with 13,838 collaborative trajectories and target-oriented instructions, including unseen maps and objects for systematic generalization evaluation.

Conclusion: Dual-altitude UAV collaboration effectively combines broad environmental reasoning with precise navigation, providing a scalable solution for complex aerial VLN tasks with efficient information exchange.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

### [73] [Pretrained Diffusion Models Are Inherently Skipped-Step Samplers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15233)
*Wenju Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Skipped-step sampling enables faster diffusion model generation by bypassing multiple intermediate steps while maintaining quality, derived from the same training objective as standard diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require sequential step-by-step generation which is computationally expensive. Existing methods like DDIM use non-Markovian processes, but there's a gap in understanding if original diffusion processes can achieve similar efficiency through Markovian approaches.

Method: Proposed skipped-step sampling mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate denoising steps in the iterative generation process. Also integrated this accelerated sampling with DDIM for enhanced generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models show the method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling steps.

Conclusion: Accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling is an intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models, enabling efficient Markovian generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional image codecs have limited coding modes and require manual mode selection by engineers, making them unfriendly for non-professional users.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) multi-functional coding framework unifying various coding modes, (2) interactive coding agent using augmented in-context learning with expert feedback, (3) IIC-bench benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Comp-X efficiently understands coding requests with impressive textual interaction capability while maintaining comparable compression performance with a single framework.

Conclusion: Provides a promising avenue for AGI in image compression by enabling intelligent, interactive image compression that understands user requirements.

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

*Han Li,Shaofei Huang,Longfei Xu,Yulu Gao,Beipeng Mu,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RATopo introduces a redundancy assignment strategy for lane topology reasoning that enables one-to-many supervision through decoder restructuring and parallel cross-attention blocks, improving topology reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use first-detect-then-reason paradigm with one-to-one assignment, resulting in suboptimal topology reasoning due to limited supervision range and lack of diversity in lane predictions.

Method: Restructures Transformer decoder by swapping cross-attention and self-attention layers to retain redundant predictions before suppression, and uses multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with independent parameters to enhance lane diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 show RATopo is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates into existing frameworks, and consistently improves both lane-lane and lane-traffic topology performance.

Conclusion: The redundancy assignment strategy enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision, overcoming limitations of traditional one-to-one assignment approaches in lane topology reasoning.

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

TL;DR: DesignCLIP leverages CLIP models for design patent analysis, addressing limitations of traditional patent images by incorporating class-aware classification, contrastive learning, and multimodal approaches to improve patent classification and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional design patent analysis relies on patent images (sketches) that often lack comprehensive visual context and semantic information, leading to ambiguities in prior art searches. Vision-language models like CLIP offer opportunities for more reliable AI-driven patent analysis.

Method: Developed DesignCLIP framework using CLIP models with class-aware classification and contrastive learning. Utilized generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. Built on a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents.

Result: DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models in patent classification and retrieval tasks. Also enables multimodal patent retrieval for enhanced creativity and innovation.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches show significant promise in advancing patent analysis, with DesignCLIP demonstrating superior performance across various downstream tasks in the patent domain.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal

*Darya Taratynova,Alya Almsouti,Beknur Kalmakhanbet,Numan Saeed,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPA is a novel framework for fetal congenital heart defect classification in ultrasound videos that combines temporal modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification to achieve state-of-the-art performance with improved calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated methods for CHD detection in ultrasound videos neglect temporal information, limit to binary classification, and lack prediction calibration, which hinders clinical reliability.

Method: Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) extracts frame features with image encoder, aggregates temporal information, aligns video representations with class-specific text prompts via contrastive loss, and uses CVAESM module for uncertainty quantification and style modulation.

Result: TPA achieves 85.40% macro F1 for CHD diagnosis, reduces calibration error by 5.38-6.8%, and boosts macro F1 by 4.73% on EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task.

Conclusion: TPA effectively addresses limitations of current methods by integrating temporal modeling, prompt learning, and uncertainty quantification, demonstrating superior performance and clinical reliability for fetal CHD classification.

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal

TL;DR: BasketLiDAR: First multimodal dataset combining LiDAR and cameras for basketball player tracking, enabling real-time 3D MOT with improved accuracy and lower computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-camera systems struggle with real-time 3D tracking due to 2D video limitations and complex reconstruction. Basketball presents extreme MOT challenges with rapid player movement, frequent occlusions, and confined space.

Method: Created BasketLiDAR dataset with synchronized LiDAR point clouds and multi-view camera footage from professional games. Developed novel MOT framework with two pipelines: LiDAR-only real-time tracking and multimodal LiDAR-camera fusion.

Result: Achieved real-time operation (previously difficult with camera-only methods) with superior tracking performance under occlusion conditions. Dataset contains 4,445 frames, 3,105 player IDs with complete 3D positional information.

Conclusion: The multimodal LiDAR-camera approach overcomes limitations of traditional camera systems, enabling accurate real-time 3D player tracking in challenging basketball scenarios with frequent occlusions.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal
tracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult
with conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking
performance even under occlusion conditions. The dataset is available upon

TL;DR: RAG-SEG is a training-free paradigm that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation for prompt generation and SAM-based segmentation for camouflaged object detection, achieving competitive performance without conventional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camouflaged object detection is challenging due to object-background similarity. Existing methods require heavy training and computational resources, while foundation models like SAM need fine-tuning and high-quality prompts that are costly to generate manually.

Method: Decouples COD into two stages: 1) RAG for generating coarse masks as prompts via unsupervised clustering and feature retrieval, 2) SAM-based segmentation for refinement using the retrieved features to produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. All experiments conducted on a personal laptop, demonstrating computational efficiency and practicality.

Conclusion: RAG-SEG eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance, offering an efficient and practical solution for camouflaged object detection tasks.

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the

Motivation: Address privacy, copyright, and safety concerns in text-to-video diffusion models by preventing generation of harmful/misleading content trained on unauthorized datasets.

Method: Two-stage plug-and-play module: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG) that integrates with existing T2V models without retraining.

Result: Achieves 46% average reduction in undesirable content across four tasks (object, style, celebrity, explicit content erasure), outperforming prior methods in efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability.

Conclusion: VideoEraser provides effective protection against misuse of T2V models while maintaining generation quality, offering state-of-the-art performance in content suppression.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As autonomous vehicles become reality, they need to predict pedestrian intentions from a distance to navigate safely. The study addresses the critical need for AI systems to anticipate whether pedestrians intend to cross roads.

Method: The research used deep learning models for pose detection combined with sequence modeling techniques (GRU, LSTM, and 1D CNN) for temporal predictions. Video analysis was conducted with pose detection output integrated into sequence models for an end-to-end framework.

Result: GRU performed better than LSTM in predicting crossing intent, while 1D CNN was the fastest model. The study successfully developed an integrated framework combining pose detection with sequence modeling for intent prediction.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates an effective end-to-end deep learning approach for pedestrian intent prediction, with different sequence models offering trade-offs between prediction accuracy (GRU) and computational speed (1D CNN), providing valuable insights for autonomous vehicle safety systems.

Abstract: The world is constantly moving towards AI based systems and autonomous
vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

*Chenhui Gou,Ziyu Ma,Zicheng Duan,Haoyu He,Feng Chen,Akide Liu,Bohan Zhuang,Jianfei Cai,Hamid Rezatofighi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a systematic empirical study using attention knockouts to understand how Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) internally process video content, revealing key insights about layer functionality and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing Video-LLM research focuses on performance improvement rather than understanding internal mechanisms, creating a gap in interpretability that this study aims to address.

Method: The authors use attention knockouts as the primary analytical tool with three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and Language-to-Video Knockout. They apply these across different layer windows in both global and fine-grained settings to analyze model behavior.

Result: Key findings include: (1) Video information extraction occurs primarily in early layers with a two-stage process (perceptual encoding in lower layers, abstract reasoning in higher layers); (2) Certain intermediate layers have disproportionate impact on video QA as critical outliers; (3) Spatial-temporal modeling relies more on language-guided retrieval than expensive intra-/inter-frame self-attention.

Conclusion: The study provides the first systematic understanding of Video-LLM internal processing, offering both interpretability insights and practical efficiency improvements through reduced attention computation, with implications for future research.

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

*Jacinto Colan,Ana Davila,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioTune is an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that selectively fine-tunes specific layers in pre-trained models to improve transfer learning efficiency and reduce computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fine-tuning methods update all model parameters, which can lead to overfitting and high computational demands. There's a need for more efficient transfer learning approaches that maintain performance while reducing resource requirements.

Method: BioTune uses an evolutionary algorithm to identify and selectively fine-tune only the most relevant layers in pre-trained models for a given target task, rather than updating all parameters.

Result: Evaluation across nine image classification datasets shows BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods like AutoRGN and LoRA, while reducing trainable parameters.

Conclusion: By focusing fine-tuning on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune enables more efficient transfer learning with reduced computational costs while maintaining or improving performance across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

*Xinshuang Liu,Runfa Blark Li,Keito Suzuki,Truong Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICGS-Quantizer is a novel compression method for 3D Gaussian Splatting that achieves kilobyte-range compression while enabling post-archival scene updates through image-conditioned decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods only achieve megabyte-range compression for medium scenes and lack mechanisms to handle scene changes after long-term archival, making them impractical for large-scale scenes or archival use.

Method: Proposes an Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer that jointly exploits inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations, uses shared codebooks across scenes, and enables conditional decoding based on images captured at decoding time for scene adaptability.

Result: ICGS-Quantizer reduces 3DGS storage requirements to kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both compression efficiency and adaptability to scene changes.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of current 3DGS compression by achieving significantly better compression ratios and providing a mechanism for handling post-archival scene updates through image-conditioned decoding.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

*Cong Wang,Xianda Guo,Wenbo Xu,Wei Tian,Ruiqi Song,Chenming Zhang,Lingxi Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveSplat is a neural Gaussian-based method for high-quality 3D scene reconstruction in driving scenarios that addresses motion blur through dynamic-static decoupling with improved geometry optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods for driving scenarios overlook background optimization with proper geometry relationships and rely too heavily on fitting individual training views, resulting in limited robustness for novel view rendering and inaccurate geometric representations.

Method: Uses region-wise voxel initialization (near/middle/far partitioning) for linear motion patterns, deformable neural Gaussians with learnable deformation network for non-rigid dynamics, and depth/normal priors from pre-trained models for geometric supervision.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo and KITTI datasets for novel-view synthesis in driving scenarios.

Conclusion: DriveSplat provides superior 3D reconstruction quality for driving scenarios through improved dynamic-static decoupling, region-aware initialization, and geometric priors, demonstrating robust novel view synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

*Ruizhuo Song,Beiming Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the abstract reasoning bottleneck in deep learning by focusing on Raven's Progressive Matrices problems. It analyzes the causal chain in RPM tasks and proposes improvements to overcome limitations in mutual information maximization approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models struggle with abstract reasoning despite strong performance in other domains. Raven's Progressive Matrices serve as an authoritative benchmark for evaluating abstract reasoning capabilities, including pattern recognition and complex problem-solving.

Method: The paper adopts a "causal chain modeling" perspective to analyze RPM tasks, designs a baseline model (DIO), and progressively proposes three improvement methods to address limitations in mutual information maximization and causal relationship capture.

Result: Experiments revealed that the initial optimization objective (maximizing variational lower bound of mutual information) failed to enable genuine acquisition of human reasoning logic due to tightness of lower bound issues and inability to capture causal relationships.

Conclusion: The paper contributes to enhancing machine intelligence's abstract reasoning abilities by systematically analyzing RPM causal chains and proposing progressive improvements to overcome fundamental limitations in current approaches.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

*Wenrui Li,Wei Han,Liang-Jian Deng,Ruiqin Xiong,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpiVG Network uses Spiking Neural Networks and variational inference for efficient video summarization, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video summarization methods struggle with capturing global temporal dependencies, maintaining semantic coherence, and handling noise during multi-channel feature fusion.

Method: Proposes Spiking Variational Graph Network with: 1) SNN-based keyframe extractor for autonomous feature learning, 2) Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner for fine-grained reasoning, and 3) Variational Inference Reconstruction Module with ELBO optimization to handle uncertainty and noise.

Result: SpiVG surpasses existing methods across multiple datasets including SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS.

Conclusion: The proposed SpiVG Network effectively addresses limitations of current video summarization techniques by combining spiking neural networks with variational inference, achieving superior performance while enhancing information density and reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes
and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/SpiVG.

*Anthony Bisulco,Rahul Ramesh,Randall Balestriero,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) learn spatial correlations in images, showing that masking ratio and patch size control feature selection for short- and long-range correlations, and provides practical guidance for hyperparameter selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAEs require extensive hyperparameter tuning for new datasets, but the connection between these hyperparameters and downstream performance remains poorly understood, particularly regarding how they affect learning of spatial correlations.

Method: The authors analytically derive features learned by linear MAEs and extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to understand how representations adapt to spatial correlations beyond second-order statistics.

Result: The study demonstrates that masking ratio and patch size can selectively capture short- and long-range spatial correlations, and shows that MAE representations adapt to dataset-specific spatial correlation patterns.

Conclusion: The analysis provides theoretical insights into MAE behavior and offers practical guidance for selecting hyperparameters based on desired spatial correlation learning properties.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

### [91] [Bidirectional Temporal Information Propagation for Moving Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15415)
*Dengyan Luo,Yanping Xiang,Hu Wang,Luping Ji. Shuai Li,Mao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIRD is a bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving infrared small target detection that simultaneously utilizes local temporal information from adjacent frames and global temporal information from past/future frames in a recursive fashion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fast inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based multi-frame methods use sliding window approaches that don't consider joint optimization of entire video clips and ignore global temporal information outside the window, leading to redundant computation and sub-optimal performance.

Method: Proposes bidirectional propagation with Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module for local spatio-temporal dependency modeling and Global Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module for global feature aggregation. Uses joint optimization with detection loss and additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) loss.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with fast inference speed.

Conclusion: BIRD effectively addresses limitations of sliding-window methods by leveraging both local and global temporal information through bidirectional propagation, achieving superior detection performance for moving infrared small targets.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

*Danish Zia Baig,Mohsin Kamal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv8-based deep learning system for automated detection of microscopic car surface dents, achieving high precision (0.86) and recall (0.84) with custom dataset and real-time data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional car damage inspection is manual, time-consuming, and unreliable for detecting tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents, creating need for automated solutions.

Method: Used YOLOv8 object recognition framework with custom variants (YOLOv8m-t4 and YOLOv8m-t42), trained on annotated dataset of car surfaces under various conditions with real-time data augmentation.

Result: YOLOv8m-t42 model achieved precision 0.86, recall 0.84, F1-score 0.85, mAP@0.5 of 0.60, and PR curve area of 0.88, outperforming other variants.

Conclusion: The deep learning approach provides accurate and efficient real-time detection of microscopic car surface defects, suitable for automated insurance assessments and vehicle inspections.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR is a transformer-based model for video-to-video moment retrieval that uses dual-stage sequence alignment and self-supervised pre-training to achieve significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-to-video moment retrieval requires semantic frame-level alignment and modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos, which existing methods struggle with.

Method: MATR uses transformer architecture with dual-stage sequence alignment to condition target video representations on query features, plus self-supervised pre-training by localizing random clips within videos.

Result: Achieves 13.1% R@1 and 8.1% mIoU improvement on ActivityNet-VRL, and 14.7% R@1 and 14.4% mIoU improvement on SportsMoments dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MATR effectively addresses the challenges of video-to-video moment retrieval through its transformer-based architecture and self-supervised pre-training approach, demonstrating substantial performance gains across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

*Zongqi He,Hanmin Li,Kin-Chung Chan,Yushen Zuo,Hao Xie,Zhe Xiao,Jun Xiao,Kin-Man Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel SfM-free 3DGS method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs 3D scenes from extremely sparse inputs (as few as 2 views), achieving 2.75dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting relies on dense multi-view inputs with precise camera poses, which are rarely available in real-world scenarios. SfM initialization fails with extremely sparse views, leading to degraded rendering quality.

Method: Proposes dense stereo module for camera pose estimation and global dense point cloud initialization, coherent view interpolation for additional supervision, and multi-scale regularization techniques for enhanced geometry and rendering quality.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches with 2.75dB PSNR improvement using only 2 training views. Produces images with minimal distortion and rich high-frequency details.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses the limitations of traditional 3DGS in sparse-view scenarios by eliminating SfM dependency and introducing novel modules for pose estimation, view interpolation, and regularization, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

TL;DR: LGMSNet is a lightweight medical image segmentation framework that uses heterogeneous kernels and transformer-convolution hybrid branches to achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead, showing strong generalization across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight medical image segmentation models sacrifice performance for efficiency and lack global contextual perception due to avoiding attention mechanisms. They also suffer from channel redundancy issues with same convolutional kernels, limiting effective feature extraction in resource-constrained clinical settings.

Method: Proposes LGMSNet framework with heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information while reducing channel redundancy. Integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information through a local and global dual multiscale approach.

Result: Extensive experiments across six public datasets show LGMSNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets, demonstrating strong real-world deployment potential.

Conclusion: LGMSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead and shows excellent generalization capabilities, making it suitable for resource-limited medical scenarios. The framework effectively addresses channel redundancy and global contextual perception limitations of existing lightweight models.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D reconstruction of clothed humans from sparse RGB images by leveraging multiple viewpoints for better geometry and pose estimation, building upon single-view limitations.

Method: Uses Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) to fit SMPL-X body model across all views with multi-view consistency, then adds geometric details via normal map integration from front and back views.

Result: Consistently improves fidelity over single-view baseline and achieves competitive performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: MExECON successfully extends single-view reconstruction to multi-view scenarios without network retraining, enabling accurate capture of clothing details and hairstyles through multi-view consistency.

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

*Mengyu Wang,Zhenyu Liu,Kun Li,Yu Wang,Yuwei Wang,Yanyan Wei,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse is a novel multimodal image fusion framework that uses adaptive wavelet transform and spatial-frequency mamba blocks to address modality misalignment and detail preservation across diverse imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MMIF methods face challenges with modality misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations, requiring a more generalized and efficient fusion approach.

Method: Proposes AdaSFFuse with two innovations: Adaptive Approximate Wavelet Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks for cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains.

Result: Superior fusion performance across four MMIF tasks (IVF, MFF, MEF, MIF) with low computational cost and compact network architecture, achieving strong performance-efficiency balance.

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse effectively addresses MMIF challenges through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning, providing robust fusion across diverse modalities while preserving critical details and maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at

TL;DR: ExtraGS is a novel framework for synthesizing extrapolated driving scene views that combines geometric and generative priors using Road Surface Gaussians and Far Field Gaussians with self-supervised uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for view extrapolation in driving scenes suffer from poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed renderings when using generative priors as pseudo ground truth.

Method: Proposes ExtraGS with Road Surface Gaussian (RSG) representation using hybrid Gaussian-SDF design, Far Field Gaussians (FFG) with learnable scaling for distant objects, and self-supervised uncertainty estimation via spherical harmonics for selective generative prior integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show ExtraGS significantly enhances realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views while maintaining high fidelity along original trajectories across multiple datasets and camera setups.

Conclusion: The holistic integration of geometric and generative priors through specialized Gaussian representations and uncertainty-aware fusion enables high-quality extrapolated view synthesis for autonomous driving simulation.

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupSketch is a two-stage method for vector sketch animation that handles multi-object interactions through semantic grouping and a Group-based Displacement Network, outperforming existing approaches in quality and temporal consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sketch animation methods struggle with multi-object interactions and complex motions, being limited to single-object cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Motion Initialization - interactively divide sketch into semantic groups and define key frames for coarse interpolation, 2) Motion Refinement - Group-based Displacement Network (GDN) refines animation with group-specific displacement fields using text-to-video priors, plus Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement for temporal consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, temporally consistent animations for complex multi-object sketches.

Conclusion: GroupSketch expands practical applications of sketch animation by effectively handling multi-object interactions and complex motions with superior quality and consistency.

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

*Chang Liu,Yang Xu,Tamas Sziranyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet is a novel network for extracting narrow roads from remote sensing imagery using dilated dual-stream differential attention fusion to handle fragmented, occluded roads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow roads in high-resolution remote sensing imagery are challenging due to limited width, fragmented topology, and frequent occlusions that conventional models struggle with.

Method: Built on D-LinkNet encoder-decoder backbone with three innovations: Differential Attention Dilation Extraction module, Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism, and multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1,3,5,9).

Result: Superior IoU and recall on DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on challenging road regions.

Conclusion: D3FNet is a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios, with verified complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADAPT is a test-time adaptation method that reframes TTA as Gaussian probabilistic inference without backpropagation, using class-conditional likelihood modeling and CLIP-guided regularization for improved robustness and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA methods rely on backpropagation/iterative optimization which limits scalability and real-time deployment, and lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions needed for reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions.

Method: Models class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and shared covariance matrix for closed-form inference. Uses lightweight regularization with CLIP priors and historical knowledge bank to correct likelihood bias. No source data, gradient updates, or full target data access required.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks under various distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

Conclusion: ADAPT provides an effective backpropagation-free TTA solution that enables reliable probabilistic inference and supports both online and transductive settings without requiring source data or gradient updates.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage training strategy using neighbor-aware soft mask to address spectral bias in Implicit Neural Representations by adaptively weighting pixels with strong local variations to improve high-frequency detail capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations struggle with spectral bias, favoring low-frequency components while missing high-frequency details like sharp edges and fine textures. Existing approaches use architectural changes or specialized activations, but there's a need for direct training guidance.

Method: Proposes a two-stage training strategy: 1) Uses neighbor-aware soft mask to assign higher weights to pixels with strong local variations, encouraging early focus on fine details 2) Transitions to full-image training for comprehensive reconstruction

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvement in reconstruction quality and complementary benefits to existing INR methods

Conclusion: This work pioneers frequency-aware pixel importance assignment in image INR, offering a new avenue for mitigating spectral bias problems through adaptive training guidance rather than architectural modifications

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

### [103] [Fast globally optimal Truncated Least Squares point cloud registration with fixed rotation axis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15613)
*Ivo Ivanov,Carsten Markgraf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel linear time convex relaxation and contractor method for Branch and Bound that enables provably globally optimal point cloud registration in under 0.5 seconds for 100 points when rotation axis is known, making it 100x faster than state-of-the-art SDP methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TLS-based point cloud registration methods can handle up to 95% outliers but are computationally expensive, with SDP relaxations taking hundreds of seconds for 100 points, creating a need for faster globally optimal solvers.

Method: Proposes a linear time convex relaxation approach combined with a contractor method to accelerate Branch and Bound optimization, specifically designed for the truncated least squares formulation with known rotation axis.

Result: The solver achieves provable global optimality in less than half a second for 100-point 3D registration when rotation axis is provided, representing a 100x speedup over state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE for rotation-only TLS problems.

Conclusion: The method provides dramatic computational improvements for globally optimal point cloud registration while maintaining robustness to high outlier rates, though currently limited to problems with known rotation axis rather than full 6DoF registration.

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

wildlife interactions and informing effective conservation planning.
Multiperspective monitoring of wildlife and human activities by combining
camera traps and drone imagery. Capturing the spatial patterns of their
distributions, which allows the identification of the overlap of their activity
zones and the assessment of the degree of human wildlife conflict. The study
was conducted in Chitwan National Park (CNP), Nepal, and adjacent regions.
Images collected by visible and nearinfrared camera traps and thermal infrared
drones from February to July 2022 were processed to create training and testing
datasets, which were used to build deep learning models to automatic identify
wildlife and human activities. Drone collected thermal imagery was used for
detecting targets to provide a multiple monitoring perspective. Spatial pattern
analysis was performed to identify animal and resident activity hotspots and
delineation potential human wildlife conflict zones. Among the deep learning
models tested, YOLOv11s achieved the highest performance with a precision of
96.2%, recall of 92.3%, mAP50 of 96.7%, and mAP50 of 81.3%, making it the most
effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts
within the conserved landscape. Integrating multiperspective monitoring with

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT is a Video LLM that improves temporal perception through diffusion-based encoding, object grounding, and explicit timestamp modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results on video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video LLMs lack fine-grained temporal perception - they have implicit timestamp encoding, weak frame-level continuity, and poor language-vision alignment for specific entities, limiting their ability to pinpoint when events occur and track entity interactions over time.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Diffusion Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder for boundary sensitivity and temporal consistency, 2) Object grounded representations that bind query entities to localized visual evidence, 3) Mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens for explicit timestamp modeling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA benchmarks, demonstrating robust grounding capabilities for fine-grained temporal reasoning.

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT successfully overcomes limitations in temporal perception for Video LLMs through its three-component design, enabling precise event localization and entity interaction tracking across time in video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

*Swann Emilien Céleste Destouches,Jesse Lahaye,Laurent Valentin Jospin,Jan Skaloud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weakly supervised approach for tree instance segmentation in ALS data using human quality ratings to train a rating model that improves segmentation performance by 34%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tree instance segmentation in airborne laser scanning data is challenging due to data variations and expensive precise labeling requirements for fully supervised methods.

Method: Human operators provide quality ratings on initial segmentation results, which train a rating model to classify segmentation outputs. The segmentation model is then finetuned using feedback from this rating model.

Result: 34% improvement in correctly identified tree instances while significantly reducing non-tree instance predictions. Performance reduced in sparsely forested regions with small trees (<2m) or complex surroundings with shrubs/boulders.

Conclusion: The weakly supervised approach effectively improves tree instance segmentation but faces challenges in complex terrain with small trees and confusing features.

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CFG is a transfer-based black-box attack method for 3D point clouds that improves adversarial transferability by prioritizing corruption of critical features shared across different DNN architectures, without requiring target model information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous 3D adversarial attack methods require information about target models, which is challenging to obtain in realistic security scenarios. The paper focuses on transfer-based attacks that don't need target model information.

Method: Proposes Critical Feature Guidance (CFG) that regularizes adversarial search by computing feature importance, prioritizing corruption of critical features likely used by diverse architectures. Also constrains maximum deviation for imperceptibility.

Result: Extensive experiments on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets show CFG outperforms state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: CFG successfully improves transferability of adversarial point clouds by focusing on critical features shared across architectures, making it effective for black-box attacks without target model information.

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

TL;DR: MapKD is a knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from multimodal teacher models to efficient vision-only student models for online HD map construction, achieving significant performance improvements while accelerating inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing online HD map construction methods depend on stale offline maps and multi-modal sensors, causing computational overhead. The goal is to create efficient vision-centric models without sacrificing performance.

Method: Proposes MapKD with Teacher-Coach-Student paradigm: 1) multimodal teacher with map priors, 2) vision-centric coach with simulated LiDAR to bridge modality gap, 3) lightweight student. Uses Token-Guided 2D Patch Distillation and Masked Semantic Response Distillation strategies.

Result: On nuScenes dataset, improves student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while accelerating inference speed.

Conclusion: MapKD effectively transfers knowledge from multimodal models to vision-only models, enabling efficient and high-performance online HD map construction without dependency on offline maps or multiple sensors.

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoD1 and LoD2 building models lack detailed facade elements essential for advanced urban analysis, while traditional LoD3 generation requires manual modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging.

Method: Leverages Conflict Maps from ray-to-model-prior analysis, semantically segments real-world CMs with synthetically generated CMs using Semantic Conflict Map Generator, and fuses additional segmentation of textured models with confidence scores.

Result: 61% performance with uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures, effectively segmenting and reconstructing building openings.

Conclusion: The research advances automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling.

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

Motivation: Existing VLM fine-tuning methods suffer from bias in class-imbalanced scenes and overlook inherent class imbalance in pre-training, leading to bias accumulation in downstream tasks.

Method: Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt Routing (MDPR) constructs comprehensive knowledge base across five visual-semantic dimensions, uses dynamic routing to align global classes, retrieve optimal prompts, and balance fine-grained semantics with logits fusion.

Result: Achieves comparable results with SOTA methods on long-tailed benchmarks (CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT), shows effectiveness for tail classes, and incurs minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: MDPR provides a flexible and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance conditions through its dynamic routing and multi-dimensional knowledge approach.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

*Yanlai Yang,Zhuokai Zhao,Satya Narayan Shukla,Aashu Singh,Shlok Kumar Mishra,Lizhu Zhang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamMem is a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for efficient long video understanding in MLLMs, achieving SOTA performance in KV cache compression without needing questions in advance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long videos due to substantial memory and computational overhead from KV cache storage. Existing visual compression methods require encoding entire visual contexts beforehand or access to questions in advance, which is impractical for long video understanding and multi-turn conversations.

Method: StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming manner, compressing KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens and generic query tokens while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory for efficient QA in memory-constrained scenarios.

Result: Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video QA benchmarks shows StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware approaches.

Conclusion: StreamMem provides an effective solution for efficient long video understanding in MLLMs by enabling streaming video processing with fixed memory footprint, making it practical for real-world applications with memory constraints.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

*Zhiheng Liu,Xueqing Deng,Shoufa Chen,Angtian Wang,Qiushan Guo,Mingfei Han,Zeyue Xue,Mengzhao Chen,Ping Luo,Linjie Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldWeaver is a novel framework for long video generation that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions (like depth) to improve temporal consistency and reduce structural drift in extended video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods relying mainly on RGB signals suffer from accumulated errors in object structure and motion over long durations, leading to temporal inconsistency and drift.

Method: The framework jointly predicts perceptual conditions and color information from unified representations, leverages depth cues (more drift-resistant than RGB) for memory bank construction, and uses segmented noise scheduling for training prediction groups.

Result: Extensive experiments on diffusion- and rectified flow-based models show WorldWeaver effectively reduces temporal drift and improves video fidelity in long-horizon generation.

Conclusion: WorldWeaver provides a robust solution for long video generation by integrating perceptual conditions with RGB modeling, significantly enhancing temporal consistency and motion dynamics while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: All-in-SAM model combines molecular-empowered learning with SAM foundation model to improve cell segmentation and classification in computational pathology, reducing annotation workload while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM enable nuclei segmentation but struggle with fine-grained semantic segmentation of specific cell subtypes. There's a need to reduce detailed pixel-level annotation requirements while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Method: Full-stack approach with: (1) molecular-empowered learning for lay annotators to reduce annotation burden, (2) SAM adapter to emphasize specific semantics while leveraging SAM's generalizability, and (3) Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL) for segmentation refinement.

Result: Significant improvement in cell classification performance across both in-house and public datasets, even with varying annotation quality.

Conclusion: The approach reduces annotator workload and extends precise biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, advancing medical diagnostics and pathology automation.

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a single integrated framework for unified image and video generation that can produce high-resolution content with complex motion and temporal consistency, addressing the need for efficient training of high-quality video generation models.

Method: Uses Hybrid Stream DiT architecture for better modality alignment and faster training convergence, implements comprehensive data curation pipeline with MLLM-based video quality filtering, and provides detailed training/inference recipes.

Result: Generates 5-10 second videos at 720p native resolution (upscaled to 1080p), achieves superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency, ranks Top 3 on T2V and I2V leaderboards, outperforms open-source models and matches commercial solutions.

Conclusion: Waver demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in unified image/video generation, providing an effective framework that can help accelerate progress in video generation technologies through its technical contributions and open recipes.

Abstract: We present Waver, a high-performance foundation model for unified image and
video generation. Waver can directly generate videos with durations ranging
from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving
superior motion amplitude and temporal consistency in video synthesis. Notably,
it ranks among the Top 3 on both the T2V and I2V leaderboards at Artificial
Analysis (data as of 2025-07-30 10:00 GMT+8), consistently outperforming
existing open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATLAS is a high-fidelity parametric body model that decouples shape and skeleton bases using 600K high-resolution scans, enabling better pose fitting and fine-grained body customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing body models struggle with detailed variations across poses and shapes due to limited training data diversity and problematic dependencies between skeleton and soft tissue.

Method: Uses 600K high-resolution scans from 240 cameras, explicitly decouples shape and skeleton bases by grounding mesh representation in human skeleton, and employs non-linear pose correctives.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in fitting unseen subjects across diverse poses, with quantitative evaluations showing non-linear pose correctives capture complex poses more effectively than linear models.

Conclusion: ATLAS provides enhanced shape expressivity, fine-grained customization, and independent keypoint fitting by addressing the fundamental coupling issues in previous parametric body modeling approaches.

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene image for applications in VR/AR and embodied AI.

Method: Uses a feature aggregation module integrating local and global scene information from visual and geometric encoders, coupled with a position head for simultaneous generation of 3D assets and their spatial positions.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the efficiency and robust generation abilities, with direct extensibility to multi-image input scenarios despite single-image training.

Conclusion: SceneGen offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation that could advance practical applications in downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

*Qingyang Mao,Qi Cai,Yehao Li,Yingwei Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Ting Yao,Qi Liu,Tao Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAREdit is a visual autoregressive framework that reframes image editing as next-scale prediction, using scale-aligned conditioning to overcome diffusion model limitations and achieve superior editing precision and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from global denoising that entangles edited regions with entire image context, causing unintended modifications and poor adherence to editing instructions. Autoregressive models offer a more compositional approach.

Method: VAREdit formulates image editing as sequential next-scale prediction over discrete visual tokens. It uses a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module to inject scale-matched conditioning information from source image features into the first self-attention layer.

Result: Outperforms leading diffusion-based methods by 30%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Completes 512×512 editing in 1.2 seconds (2.2× faster than similarly sized UltraEdit).

Conclusion: VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and efficiency, providing a more precise and faster alternative to diffusion-based image editing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot
effectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this
gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.
VAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and
efficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based
methods by 30\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a
$512\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\times$ faster than the
similarly sized UltraEdit. The models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable group inference method that improves diversity and quality of multiple samples by formulating selection as a quadratic integer assignment problem with progressive candidate pruning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independent sampling in generative models leads to redundant results when presenting multiple outputs to users, limiting choices and hindering idea exploration in real-world applications.

Method: Formulates group inference as a quadratic integer assignment problem where candidate outputs are graph nodes, selecting subsets to optimize quality (unary term) and maximize diversity (binary term) with progressive candidate pruning for efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant improvements in group diversity and quality compared to independent sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms across various tasks.

Conclusion: The framework enables generative models to treat multiple outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples, generalizing across text-to-image, image-to-image, image prompting, and video generation tasks.

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CineScale is a novel inference paradigm that enables high-resolution visual generation (up to 8k images and 4k videos) without fine-tuning, addressing repetitive pattern issues in diffusion models when generating beyond their training resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual diffusion models are limited to low-resolution training due to data and computational constraints, and existing tuning-free methods produce low-quality content with repetitive patterns when generating higher resolutions.

Method: Proposes CineScale, a specialized inference paradigm with dedicated variants for different video generation architectures, built on state-of-the-art open-source frameworks to handle increased high-frequency information.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance in higher-resolution generation, enabling 8k image generation without fine-tuning and 4k video generation with minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

Conclusion: CineScale successfully extends the capabilities of pre-trained models for high-resolution visual generation across various tasks (T2I, T2V, I2V, V2V) while maintaining quality and avoiding repetitive patterns.

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated

Motivation: Neuromorphic event sensors produce asynchronous pixel data rather than traditional video frames, but current research focuses on application development while ignoring data transmission challenges

Method: Survey existing event-based video systems, analyze technical issues from recent scalable event streaming work, and propose new streaming format based on Media Over QUIC protocol draft

Result: Identifies gap in event-based video transmission research and proposes technical solution for low-latency streaming

Conclusion: Event-based video systems require specialized streaming solutions different from traditional video compression, and Media Over QUIC protocol provides promising foundation for low-latency event streaming format

Abstract: Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional
video steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records
video with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors
are designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video
consumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on
application development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We
survey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues
with our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency
event streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC
protocol draft.

TL;DR: A zero-shot 3D CT super-resolution framework using diffusion-generated 2D X-ray projection priors and 3D Gaussian splatting with negative alpha blending for enhanced detail reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of supervised SR methods requiring paired LR-HR datasets and zero-shot methods struggling with fine anatomical details by leveraging abundant HR 2D X-ray data.

Method: Uses diffusion model trained on large-scale 2D X-ray projections with per-projection adaptive sampling, then employs 3D Gaussian splatting with negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) for residual learning between LR and diffusion-based projections.

Result: Superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT super-resolution on two datasets, achieving better fine anatomical detail recovery.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively combines diffusion-based 2D priors with 3D reconstruction techniques, providing a powerful zero-shot solution for CT super-resolution without requiring paired training data.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring
high-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep
learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct
HR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown
promising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that
are often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for
paired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover
fine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,
we propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D
X-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the
abundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D
X-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It
selects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR
projections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These
projections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT
volume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows
negative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual
learning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing
high-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that
our method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in digital pathology by developing unsupervised anomaly detection that doesn't require extensive annotations, building on recent success of diffusion models.

Method: Combine vision-language model with diffusion model, using pathology-related keywords for normal tissues to guide reconstruction process and enable differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues.

Result: Experiments on gastric lymph node dataset show effectiveness, with good generalization ability demonstrated on breast lymph node dataset under domain shift conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed method shows strong potential for unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology, offering a viable alternative to supervised approaches.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is an emerging approach in digital pathology for its
ability to efficiently and effectively utilize data for disease diagnosis.
While supervised learning approaches deliver high accuracy, they rely on
extensively annotated datasets, suffering from data scarcity in digital
pathology. Unsupervised anomaly detection, however, offers a viable alternative
by identifying deviations from normal tissue distributions without requiring
exhaustive annotations. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have
gained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising
performance in both natural and medical imaging datasets. Building on this, we
incorporate a vision-language model with a diffusion model for unsupervised
anomaly detection in digital pathology, utilizing histopathology prompts during
reconstruction. Our approach employs a set of pathology-related keywords
associated with normal tissues to guide the reconstruction process,
facilitating the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a
gastric lymph node dataset from a local hospital and assess its generalization
ability under domain shift using a public breast lymph node dataset. The
experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed method for
unsupervised anomaly detection across various organs in digital pathology.

Motivation: To develop efficient and explainable AI solutions for medical image classification that can operate in resource-constrained clinical environments while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: Used high-capacity teacher models (VGG19, Visformer-S, AutoFormer-V2-T) to guide training of compact OFA-595 student model through hybrid supervision combining ground-truth labels and teacher soft targets. Validated on COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000 datasets with Score-CAM visualizations for interpretability.

Result: Distilled student model maintained high classification performance with significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it suitable for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: Combining model efficiency with explainability is crucial for practical and trustworthy medical AI solutions in resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Abstract: This study comprehensively explores knowledge distillation frameworks for
COVID-19 and lung cancer classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images. We
employ high-capacity teacher models, including VGG19 and lightweight Vision
Transformers (Visformer-S and AutoFormer-V2-T), to guide the training of a
compact, hardware-aware student model derived from the OFA-595 supernet. Our
approach leverages hybrid supervision, combining ground-truth labels with
teacher models' soft targets to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.
We validate our models on two benchmark datasets: COVID-QU-Ex and LCS25000,
covering multiple classes, including COVID-19, healthy, non-COVID pneumonia,
lung, and colon cancer. To interpret the spatial focus of the models, we employ
Score-CAM-based visualizations, which provide insight into the reasoning
process of both teacher and student networks. The results demonstrate that the
distilled student model maintains high classification performance with
significantly reduced parameters and inference time, making it an optimal
choice in resource-constrained clinical environments. Our work underscores the
importance of combining model efficiency with explainability for practical,

Abstract: Clinical cystoscopy, the current standard for bladder cancer diagnosis,
suffers from significant reliance on physician expertise, leading to
variability and subjectivity in diagnostic outcomes. There is an urgent need
for objective, accurate, and efficient computational approaches to improve
bladder cancer diagnostics.
  Leveraging recent advancements in deep learning, this study proposes an
integrated multi-task deep learning framework specifically designed for bladder
cancer diagnosis from cystoscopic images. Our framework includes a robust
classification model using EfficientNet-B0 enhanced with Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM), an advanced segmentation model based on

a Dice coefficient of 0.9091. The online platform significantly improved the
accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of clinical bladder cancer diagnostics,
enabling practical and user-friendly deployment. The code is publicly
available.
  Our multi-task framework and integrated online tool collectively advance the
field of intelligent bladder cancer diagnosis by improving clinical
reliability, supporting early tumor detection, and enabling real-time
diagnostic feedback. These contributions mark a significant step toward
AI-assisted decision-making in urology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DoSReMC is a batch normalization adaptation framework that improves cross-domain generalization for mammography cancer classification by fine-tuning only BN and FC layers while preserving pretrained convolutional filters, addressing domain shift issues in AI deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for breast cancer recognition suffer performance degradation when applied to different domains due to domain shift, limiting safe and equitable AI deployment in clinical settings.

Method: Proposes DoSReMC framework that fine-tunes only batch normalization and fully connected layers while preserving pretrained convolutional filters, combined with adversarial training for enhanced cross-domain generalization.

Result: Demonstrates that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence and shows significant improvements in cross-domain generalizability using three large-scale FFDM datasets including a new pathologically confirmed in-house dataset.

Conclusion: DoSReMC provides a practical pathway for robust and generalizable mammography classification systems that can be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines across diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic
recognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their
performance often declines when applied to data from different domains,
primarily due to domain shift -- the variation in data distributions between
source and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable
deployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present
DoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch
normalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain
generalization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets -- including HCTP, a newly
introduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset -- we conduct a
systematic cross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Our results demonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain
dependence: they perform effectively when training and testing occur within the
same domain, and they significantly impair model generalization under domain
shift. DoSReMC addresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully
connected (FC) layers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We
further integrate this targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme,
yielding additional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can
be readily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse
clinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and
generalizable mammography classification systems.

### [126] [Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15553)
*Jin Ye,Jingran Wang,Fengchao Xiong,Jingzhou Chen,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Proposes DECSC - a Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding framework that combines 2D/3D convolutional sparse representations with transformer blocks for robust hyperspectral image denoising with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep unfolding methods for HSI denoising lack convergence guarantees as they use predefined network depths. DEQ models provide infinite-depth networks naturally consistent with optimization, making them suitable for robust denoising.

Method: Combines 2D CSC for global spatial consistency across bands, 3D CSC for local spatial-spectral details, transformer blocks for nonlocal self-similarities, and detail enhancement modules. Formulates proximal gradient descent as fixed-point problem within DEQ framework.

Result: Superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed DECSC framework.

Conclusion: DECSC successfully unifies multiple HSI characteristics (local correlations, nonlocal similarities, global consistency) within a DEQ-based framework, providing robust denoising with convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are
often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the
denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep
unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a
physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks
convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the
hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and
models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the
optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium
Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local
spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global
spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse
coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse
representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while
unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral
details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is
embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is
integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate
the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and
transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within
the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method
achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [127] [Are Virtual DES Images a Valid Alternative to the Real Ones?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15594)
*Ana C. Perre,Luís A. Alexandre,Luís C. Freire*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This study explores generating virtual dual-energy subtracted (DES) mammography images from low-energy images using deep learning models, achieving 85.59% F1 score for lesion classification, which is close to real DES performance (90.35%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce patient radiation exposure by generating artificial DES images from LE images instead of acquiring high-energy images, potentially making CESM examinations safer.

Method: Evaluated three deep learning models: pre-trained U-Net, end-to-end trained U-Net, and CycleGAN for generating virtual DES images from LE images, then assessed classification performance for malignant vs non-malignant lesions.

Result: Pre-trained U-Net achieved best performance with 85.59% F1 score using virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with real DES images. The 4.76% gap suggests real DES contains additional diagnostic information.

Conclusion: Virtual DES image generation shows considerable potential, and future advancements could narrow the performance gap to make exclusive reliance on virtual images clinically viable, reducing radiation exposure.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that
provides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy
subtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the
emergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial
generation of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such
techniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,
potentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy
image acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the
artificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a
U-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a
series of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the
classification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant
categories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of
virtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that
the best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an
F1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with
the real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional
diagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher
classification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image
generation is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance
gap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes
clinically viable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Using radiologists' per-pixel confidence values instead of binary labels improves AI segmentation in lung ultrasound and enhances downstream clinical task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inter-observer variability and label uncertainty in medical imaging, particularly in lung ultrasound where visual interpretation is subjective and annotations are challenging even for experienced clinicians.

Method: Introduce data annotation protocol capturing radiologists' per-pixel confidence values. Train AI models using binarized labels obtained with confidence thresholds (60% works best), exposing aleatoric uncertainty during training.

Result: Incorporating confidence values improves segmentation performance and translates to better performance on downstream clinical tasks: S/F oxygenation ratio estimation, S/F ratio change classification, and 30-day patient readmission prediction. High confidence thresholds (60%) outperform naive 50% approach.

Conclusion: Label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI in medical imaging by addressing inherent uncertainty in real-world clinical data.

Abstract: In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often
introduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual
interpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it
frequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly
discernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for
experienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both
labeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence
values. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a
data annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in
each labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in
real-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence
values during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More
importantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into
better performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,
estimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and
predicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many
methods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a
simple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)
confidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better
than a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very
confident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates
the impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only
segmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results
suggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly
leveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI
in medical imaging.

### [129] [Hessian-based lightweight neural network for brain vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15660)
*Alexandra Bernadotte,Elfimov Nikita,Mikhail Shutov,Ivan Menshikov*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: HessNet is a lightweight semi-supervised neural network with only 6000 parameters that uses Hessian matrices for accurate 3D brain vessel segmentation in MRA images, enabling creation of a large annotated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations, and current methods like manual segmentation or classical filters lack sufficient accuracy for surgical procedures.

Method: Proposed HessNet - a Hessian-based neural network with 6000 parameters that can run on CPU, using semi-supervised learning for 3D segmentation of tubular structures like blood vessels.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art vessel segmentation accuracy on minimal training data, enabled creation of a large semi-manually annotated dataset (200 images) with expert supervision, and significantly reduced resource requirements.

Conclusion: HessNet provides an efficient solution for brain vessel segmentation that reduces annotation burden on experts while maintaining high accuracy, and contributes a valuable publicly available dataset for future research.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance
angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as
aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed
through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,
which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful
tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on
well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly
available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.
  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight
neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex
structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is
a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on
the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural
networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset
reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually
annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset
(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the
supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides
high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the
most complex important cases. The dataset is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional interactive maps rely on pre-existing structured GIS data, which limits their ability to address visual questions about what the world actually looks like.

Method: Combines analysis of large-scale geospatial image repositories (street views, place photos, aerial imagery) with traditional GIS data sources using multimodal AI agents.

Result: A vision for agents capable of understanding and responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries through comprehensive geospatial data analysis.

Conclusion: Presents a new paradigm for geo-visual question answering with defined approaches, exemplars, and identifies key challenges and opportunities for future development.

Abstract: Interactive digital maps have revolutionized how people travel and learn
about the world; however, they rely on pre-existing structured data in GIS
databases (e.g., road networks, POI indices), limiting their ability to address
geo-visual questions related to what the world looks like. We introduce our
vision for Geo-Visual Agents--multimodal AI agents capable of understanding and
responding to nuanced visual-spatial inquiries about the world by analyzing
large-scale repositories of geospatial images, including streetscapes (e.g.,
Google Street View), place-based photos (e.g., TripAdvisor, Yelp), and aerial
imagery (e.g., satellite photos) combined with traditional GIS data sources. We
define our vision, describe sensing and interaction approaches, provide three
exemplars, and enumerate key challenges and opportunities for future work.

TL;DR: Self-learning physics-informed GAN for single-shot X-ray phase retrieval without training data, enabling simultaneous phase and absorption reconstruction from single holograms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional phase retrieval methods rely on approximations and manual parameter tuning, limiting adaptability for complex samples and experimental conditions. Deep learning approaches face challenges due to training data requirements.

Method: Physics-informed generative adversarial network that reconstructs both phase and absorbance from single intensity measurements without requiring paired, unpaired, or simulated training data.

Result: Robust performance across diverse imaging conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative high-quality reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets from PETRA III beamline.

Conclusion: The approach significantly broadens applicability of phase contrast imaging by eliminating training data requirements and enabling simultaneous retrieval of phase and absorption information from single measurements.

Abstract: X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of
structures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across
a wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is
particularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando
(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity
measurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during
the measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative
methods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may
not be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require
manual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less
adaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning
approach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field
regime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A
physics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both
the phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane
from a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase
retrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated
training data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,
as acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due
to the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The
algorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging
conditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality
reconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at
beamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum
Hereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and
absorption information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Query ambiguity is a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL systems, causing misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL generation.

Method: Introduces a fine-grained ambiguity taxonomy to identify ambiguities affecting database element mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback through multiple-choice questions to rewrite ambiguous questions.

Result: Achieves 87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by 50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems.

Conclusion: AmbiSQL demonstrates significant performance gains and practical usability for addressing query ambiguity in Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems translate natural language questions into SQL queries,
providing substantial value for non-expert users. While large language models
(LLMs) show promising results for this task, they remain error-prone. Query
ambiguity has been recognized as a major obstacle for LLM-based Text-to-SQL
systems, leading to misinterpretation of user intent and inaccurate SQL
generation. We demonstrate AmbiSQL, an interactive system that automatically
detects query ambiguities and guides users through intuitive multiple-choice
questions to clarify their intent. Our approach introduces a fine-grained
ambiguity taxonomy for identifying ambiguities that affect database element
mapping and LLM reasoning, then incorporates user feedback to rewrite ambiguous
questions. Evaluation on an ambiguous query dataset shows that AmbiSQL achieves
87.2% precision in ambiguity detection and improves SQL exact match accuracy by
50% when integrated with Text-to-SQL systems. Our demonstration showcases the
significant performance gains and highlights the system's practical usability.

*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Semantic normalization framework for hierarchical narrative graphs that reduces annotation inconsistency and redundancy using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symbolic narrative graphs suffer from inconsistency and redundancy where similar actions/events are labeled differently across annotations, limiting reasoning and generalization effectiveness.

Method: Propose semantic normalization methods using lexical similarity and embedding-based clustering to consolidate semantically related actions and events across hierarchical narrative levels.

Result: Applied to Manga109 dataset, normalization improves coherence and robustness in narrative reasoning tasks like action retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization while maintaining symbolic transparency.

Conclusion: Semantic normalization is a key step toward scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative understanding.

Abstract: Understanding visual narratives such as comics requires structured
representations that capture events, characters, and their relations across
multiple levels of story organization. However, symbolic narrative graphs often
suffer from inconsistency and redundancy, where similar actions or events are
labeled differently across annotations or contexts. Such variance limits the
effectiveness of reasoning and generalization.
  This paper introduces a semantic normalization framework for hierarchical
narrative knowledge graphs. Building on cognitively grounded models of
narrative comprehension, we propose methods that consolidate semantically
related actions and events using lexical similarity and embedding-based
clustering. The normalization process reduces annotation noise, aligns symbolic
categories across narrative levels, and preserves interpretability.
  We demonstrate the framework on annotated manga stories from the Manga109
dataset, applying normalization to panel-, event-, and story-level graphs.
Preliminary evaluations across narrative reasoning tasks, such as action
retrieval, character grounding, and event summarization, show that semantic
normalization improves coherence and robustness, while maintaining symbolic
transparency. These findings suggest that normalization is a key step toward
scalable, cognitively inspired graph models for multimodal narrative
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event video research has grown but existing representations lack flexibility, speed, and compressibility. The previously proposed ADΔER representation addresses these limitations but needed better visualization tools.

Method: Developed improved adder-viz software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes and applications, released as MIT-licensed open source code.

Result: Created centralized repository with enhanced visualization capabilities for the ADΔER event video representation system.

Conclusion: The improved adder-viz software provides better tools for working with the ADΔER event video representation, facilitating real-time visualization and application development in event-based vision systems.

Abstract: Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video
research, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews
video frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much
work has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,
these representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and

*Haji Gul,Abul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSG complexity metric fails to perform robustly in knowledge graph link prediction settings, showing sensitivity to parameters and weak correlation with performance metrics. Better alternatives include relation entropy and diversity measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the effectiveness of Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) as a dataset complexity metric for knowledge graph link prediction and compare it with alternative structural and semantic complexity measures.

Method: Critical examination of CSG in multi-relational link prediction with transformer embeddings, introduction of new structural/semantic KG complexity metrics (Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, Relation Type Cardinality), and benchmarking against standard performance metrics (MRR, Hit@1, Hit@10).

Result: CSG is highly sensitive to parametrization, doesn't scale robustly with class cardinality, and shows weak/inconsistent correlation with MRR and Hit@1. Relation Entropy, Maximum Relation Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations with performance metrics, while graph connectivity measures correlate positively with Hit@10.

Conclusion: CSG's claimed stability and generalization predictive power fail in link prediction settings, highlighting the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned complexity measures for knowledge-driven learning.

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale benchmark datasets for heterogeneous text-attributed graphs (TAGs), which hinders the development and fair comparison of representation learning methods on such graphs.

Method: Created CITE dataset with 438K nodes and 1.2M edges spanning four relation types, established standardized evaluation procedures, and conducted benchmarking on node classification task with four classes of learning paradigms: homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph models, LLM-centric models, and LLM+Graph models.

Result: The paper introduces the CITE benchmark dataset and provides comprehensive baseline experiments across diverse modeling paradigms, enabling fair comparison of representation learning methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs.

Conclusion: CITE addresses the critical bottleneck in heterogeneous TAG research by providing the first large-scale benchmark, standardized evaluation protocols, and extensive benchmarking results, facilitating future development in this area.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

TL;DR: Bayesian analysis shows automated audio classifiers significantly distort language acquisition research estimates, with errors potentially masking true effect sizes by 20-80%. A calibration approach helps but isn't foolproof.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated classifiers are widely used to analyze children's language data from wearable recorders, but little research examines how classification errors affect downstream statistical inferences and scientific conclusions.

Method: Proposes a Bayesian approach to study effects of algorithmic errors on key scientific questions, analyzing both LENA system and open-source Voice Type Classifier from ACLEW system.

Result: Classification errors significantly distort estimates - automated annotations underestimated negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20-80%, potentially making effects statistically insignificant.

Conclusion: Bayesian calibration can help recover unbiased estimates but isn't perfect. The issue applies broadly to any classifier with non-zero error rates in event detection and classification tasks.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

TL;DR: Intern-S1 is a 28B parameter multimodal MoE model specialized for scientific domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance in professional scientific tasks while maintaining competitive general reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap between open-source and closed-source models in scientific professional fields, and advance towards AGI by developing specialized generalist models for scientific multimodal data analysis.

Method: Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 28B activated parameters, continual pre-training on 5T tokens (2.5T scientific), followed by offline and online RL training using Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) on 1000+ tasks simultaneously.

Result: Top-tier performance in online RL training, competitive on general reasoning tasks, significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, and surpasses closed-source SOTA models in professional tasks like molecular synthesis planning and crystal stability prediction.

Conclusion: Intern-S1 successfully bridges the gap in scientific AI capabilities, demonstrating that specialized generalist models can achieve superior performance in high-value scientific domains while maintaining general reasoning abilities.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular
synthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic
stabilities for crystals. Our models are available at

*Shaswati Saha,Sourajit Saha,Manas Gaur,Tejas Gokhale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concept Erasure Techniques (CETs) for text-to-image models are vulnerable to circumvention through hierarchical and compositional prompts, suffer from attribute leakage, and exhibit attention concentration/dispersal side effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy, copyright, and safety concerns in text-to-image generative models by developing techniques to erase unwanted concepts while maintaining image quality for other concepts.

Method: Proposed Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) benchmark with hierarchical and compositional prompts to measure CET robustness across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage.

Result: CETs can be easily circumvented using superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts. They suffer from attribute leakage and attention concentration/dispersal phenomena.

Conclusion: Current CETs have significant vulnerabilities and side effects, highlighting the need for more robust concept erasure techniques. The authors release dataset and tools to support future research.

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

### [141] [Probability Density from Latent Diffusion Models for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15737)
*Joonas Järve,Karl Kaspar Haavel,Meelis Kull*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether likelihood-based out-of-distribution detection fails due to pixel space limitations or fundamental density estimation issues, by training a Variational Diffusion Model on ResNet-18 representations instead of images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite likelihood being theoretically optimal for OOD detection under uniform OOD assumption, it often fails in practice. The authors want to determine if this failure is due to pixel space limitations in generative models or inherent density estimation problems.

Method: Trained a Variational Diffusion Model on the representation space of a pre-trained ResNet-18 (rather than on images) to evaluate likelihood-based OOD detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods from OpenOOD suite.

Result: The paper compares performance of their representation-space likelihood detector against existing methods, though specific results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The study aims to determine whether OOD detection failures with likelihood methods stem from pixel space limitations or deeper density estimation issues in representation spaces.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

TL;DR: SurgWound is the first open-source dataset for surgical wound screening with 697 images annotated by surgeons, featuring a benchmark with VQA and report generation tasks, and a three-stage MLLM framework called WoundQwen for comprehensive wound diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of publicly available surgical wound datasets and benchmarks due to data privacy concerns and high annotation costs, which hinders development of open-source surgical wound screening tools.

Method: Created SurgWound dataset with 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with 8 clinical attributes. Developed a three-stage MLLM framework (WoundQwen) that: 1) uses 5 MLLMs to predict wound characteristics, 2) uses predictions as knowledge inputs for diagnosis, and 3) integrates results to generate comprehensive reports.

Result: First open-source surgical wound dataset and benchmark established. The proposed WoundQwen framework can analyze detailed wound characteristics from images, assess infection risk, provide intervention guidance, and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.

Conclusion: The SurgWound dataset and WoundQwen framework enable personalized wound care through automated surgical wound screening, facilitating timely interventions and improved patient outcomes while addressing data privacy and annotation cost barriers.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

### [143] [Don't Think Twice! Over-Reasoning Impairs Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15050)
*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Increasing reasoning budgets in LLMs worsens confidence calibration, while search-augmented generation dramatically improves accuracy to 89.3%, suggesting information access is more critical than reasoning depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models need robust calibration to avoid overconfidence in question answering, requiring systematic evaluation of how reasoning capabilities and computational budgets affect confidence assessment accuracy.

Method: Used ClimateX dataset expanded to human and planetary health, evaluated reasoning LLMs' confidence calibration with varying reasoning budgets, and compared with search-augmented generation approaches.

Result: Reasoning LLMs achieved 48.7% accuracy in confidence assessment, but increasing reasoning budgets consistently impaired calibration, causing systematic overconfidence. Search-augmented generation achieved 89.3% accuracy by retrieving relevant evidence.

Conclusion: Information access, rather than reasoning depth or inference budget, is the critical bottleneck for improved confidence calibration in knowledge-intensive tasks, challenging the "test-time scaling" paradigm.

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: GOOD is an online method that uses LLMs to infer natural language goals from human interactions in open-universe assistance games, enabling rich goal representation and uncertainty estimation without large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied AI agents need to interpret and act on diverse, undefined human goals and preferences in evolving environments, requiring a framework that can handle unbounded goal spaces.

Method: GOOD prompts LLMs to simulate users with complex intents, using their responses to perform probabilistic inference over candidate natural language goals during human interactions.

Result: The method outperforms baselines without explicit goal tracking in both text-based grocery shopping and simulated household robotics environments, as validated by LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: GOOD provides a data-efficient approach for goal inference in open-universe settings, enabling embodied AI agents to better understand and act on human intentions through natural language goal representations.

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Result: Extensive experiments show aiXiv significantly enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers through iterative revising and reviewing, demonstrating reliability and robustness.

Conclusion: aiXiv lays the groundwork for a next-generation open-access ecosystem that accelerates publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research, creating a scalable and extensible platform for autonomous scientific discovery.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with rare medical conditions like hyperhidrosis due to scarce and unreliable datasets for fine-tuning, despite the condition affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting physical comfort and psychosocial well-being.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) Data augmentation using frontier LLM to generate medically plausible synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data, 2) Fine-tuning open-source foundation model on the created dataset, 3) Inference and expert evaluation by clinical and psychological specialists with iterative dataset enrichment.

Result: LLM4Sweat outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for hyperhidrosis, providing accurate diagnosis, personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.

Conclusion: The framework offers a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with similar data scarcity and trustworthiness challenges, demonstrating successful application of LLMs to rare medical conditions through synthetic data generation and expert validation.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multiple memory system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology improves agent memory quality by processing short-term memory into multiple long-term fragments with retrieval and contextual units, enhancing response quality through better historical data utilization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent memory modules like MemoryBank and A-MEM have poor quality stored memory content, which negatively impacts recall performance and response quality when handling large amounts of historical interaction data.

Method: Designed a multiple memory system that processes short-term memory into multiple long-term memory fragments, constructs retrieval memory units and contextual memory units with one-to-one correspondence, and matches relevant retrieval units during query to obtain corresponding contextual units for response enhancement.

Result: Experiments on LoCoMo dataset showed effectiveness compared to three other methods, ablation studies confirmed memory unit rationality, and analysis demonstrated robustness regarding memory segment selection and storage overhead.

Conclusion: The MMS approach effectively constructs high-quality long-term memory content and demonstrates practical value for enhancing agent performance through better utilization of historical interaction data.

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

*Jinning Yang,Wen Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DiagECG integrates ECG signals with language models by discretizing ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens, enabling LLMs to process both ECG data and natural language for clinical text generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated ECG approaches struggle with generalization across clinical tasks and lack open-ended reasoning capabilities, limiting their diagnostic utility.

Method: Discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into symbolic tokens using lead-independent encoder and quantization, extends LLM vocabulary with ECG tokens, pretrains on ECG forecasting, and performs instruction tuning for ECG QA and report generation.

Result: Achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining generalization to out-of-distribution settings without modifying the core model.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective integration of symbolic ECG representations into LLMs, highlighting potential for medical reasoning applications.

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework provides a robust solution for generating and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing data preparation costs in LLM training.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT
and DPO use cases, enabling seamless integration into diverse training
workflows. Together, these innovations offer a robust solution for generating
and managing synthetic conversational data at scale, significantly reducing the
overhead of data preparation in LLM training pipelines.

### [150] [Language-Guided Tuning: Enhancing Numeric Optimization with Textual Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15757)
*Yuxing Lu,Yucheng Hu,Nan Sun,Xukai Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LGT is a novel framework using multi-agent LLMs with natural language reasoning and textual gradients to optimize ML configurations, outperforming traditional methods while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional configuration optimization approaches treat dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while automated methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about optimization decisions.

Method: Language-Guided Tuning (LGT) employs multi-agent LLMs with three specialized agents (Advisor, Evaluator, Optimizer) and uses textual gradients - qualitative feedback signals for semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration interdependencies.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets shows LGT demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods, achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Conclusion: LGT provides an effective framework for intelligent configuration optimization through natural language reasoning and multi-agent coordination, addressing limitations of traditional approaches.

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A training-free agentic system that uses VLMs and LLMs to convert rough sketches into precise, editable SVG diagrams through iterative qualitative reasoning and candidate selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models struggle with spatial precision and symbolic structure required for diagram generation, while existing methods lack the ability to produce editable vector graphics with proper alignment and connectivity.

Method: See it. Say it. Sorted. system couples Vision-Language Models with LLMs in an iterative loop: Critic VLM proposes qualitative edits, multiple LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies, and Judge VLM selects the best candidate.

Result: Outperforms GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro on 10 flowchart sketches, more faithfully reconstructing layout and structure while accurately composing primitives without unwanted text artifacts.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges sketch-to-diagram generation with editable SVG outputs, supports human-in-the-loop corrections, and is extensible to presentation tools via APIs with open-sourced implementation.

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

*Amin Bigdeli,Negar Arabzadeh,Ebrahim Bagheri,Charles L. A. Clarke*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FSAP is a black-box attack framework that uses LLM few-shot prompting to generate adversarial documents that outrank authentic content in neural ranking systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural ranking models are vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, and existing approaches rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting, requiring gradient access or model instrumentation.

Method: FSAP uses few-shot prompting with LLMs, conditioning on a small support set of harmful examples to generate fluent, coherent adversarial documents. Two modes: FSAP-IntraQ (same query examples) and FSAP-InterQ (cross-query generalization).

Result: FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible documents on TREC 2020-2021 Health Misinformation Tracks across four neural ranking models, with strong stance alignment and low detectability.

Conclusion: FSAP poses a realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems, effectively generalizing across both proprietary and open-source LLMs through prompt-based adversarial document generation.

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

TL;DR: Combining optic nerve head structural features and visual field functional parameters using machine learning improves classification of slow vs fast glaucoma progression in primary angle closure glaucoma patients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better predict glaucoma progression risk in PACG patients by integrating both structural (OCT) and functional (visual field) parameters rather than using them separately.

Method: Used AI-segmented OCT volumes to extract 31 ONH parameters and sector-based visual field data from 451 eyes. Trained multiple ML classifiers including Random Forest, with SHAP analysis to identify key predictors. Defined fast progression as VFI decline < -2.0% per year.

Result: Random Forest model combining structural and functional features achieved best performance (AUC = 0.87). Six key predictors identified: inferior MRW, inferior/inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness.

Conclusion: Integrated structural-functional approach significantly improves progression risk classification in PACG. Inferior ONH features (MRW and RNFL thickness) are most predictive, emphasizing ONH morphology's critical role in monitoring disease progression.

Abstract: Purpose: To classify eyes as slow or fast glaucoma progressors in patients
with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) using an integrated approach
combining optic nerve head (ONH) structural features and sector-based visual
field (VF) functional parameters. Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF
tests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,
with baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline
<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were
AI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters. The Glaucoma Hemifield Test defined
five regions per hemifield, aligned with RNFL distribution. Mean sensitivity
per region was combined with structural parameters to train ML classifiers.
Multiple models were tested, and SHAP identified key predictors. Main outcome
measures: Classification of slow versus fast progressors using combined
structural and functional data. Results: We analyzed 451 eyes from 299
patients. Mean VFI progression was -0.92% per year; 369 eyes progressed slowly
and 82 rapidly. The Random Forest model combining structural and functional
features achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo
iterations). SHAP identified six key predictors: inferior MRW, inferior and
inferior-temporal RNFL thickness, nasal-temporal LC curvature, superior nasal
VF sensitivity, and inferior RNFL and GCL+IPL thickness. Models using only
structural or functional features performed worse with AUC of 0.82 and 0.78,
respectively. Conclusions: Combining ONH structural and VF functional
parameters significantly improves classification of progression risk in PACG.
Inferior ONH features, MRW and RNFL thickness, were the most predictive,
highlighting the critical role of ONH morphology in monitoring disease
progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of research on whether Chinese syllables contain heart failure-related information compared to other well-studied languages, despite speech being a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for HF identification.

Method: Created first Chinese speech database of HF patients with paired recordings before/after hospitalization. Used standard patient-wise and personalized pair-wise classification approaches. Proposed adaptive frequency filter (AFF) for frequency importance analysis.

Result: Confirmed effectiveness of Chinese language in HF detection using both classification approaches. Pair-wise approach serves as ideal speaker-decoupled baseline. Statistical tests show individual differences are key contributors to inaccuracy.

Conclusion: Chinese speech contains valuable HF-related information. The database and proposed methods provide foundation for future research in Chinese HF detection using speech analysis.

Abstract: Speech is a cost-effective and non-intrusive data source for identifying
acute and chronic heart failure (HF). However, there is a lack of research on
whether Chinese syllables contain HF-related information, as observed in other
well-studied languages. This study presents the first Chinese speech database
of HF patients, featuring paired recordings taken before and after
hospitalisation. The findings confirm the effectiveness of the Chinese language
in HF detection using both standard 'patient-wise' and personalised 'pair-wise'
classification approaches, with the latter serving as an ideal
speaker-decoupled baseline for future research. Statistical tests and
classification results highlight individual differences as key contributors to
inaccuracy. Additionally, an adaptive frequency filter (AFF) is proposed for
frequency importance analysis. The data and demonstrations are published at

TL;DR: Vision-based intuitive teleoperation system for quadruped robots using wrist tracking and collision avoidance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Teleoperating quadruped robots with manipulator arms is challenging due to non-intuitive controls, high cognitive load, and collision risks in confined spaces, requiring more accessible and safer solutions

Method: Uses vision-based pose estimation with external camera and ML model to detect operator's wrist position, maps movements to robotic arm commands in real-time, and employs trajectory planner for collision detection and prevention

Result: System demonstrated robust real-time performance on actual robot, providing reliable and intuitive control

Conclusion: This approach offers a cost-effective solution for industrial applications requiring safety, precision, and ease of use in high-risk environments

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Conclusion: Lang2Lift provides a viable solution for automating pallet pick-up operations using natural language guidance and foundation models, successfully addressing challenges in outdoor environments with variable conditions and unstructured surroundings.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment

TL;DR: RAGAN framework uses multimodal foundation models to generate high-quality fake user profiles with textual reviews for poisoning recommender systems, achieving state-of-the-art attack performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, but existing methods struggle with generating high-quality fake profiles that are both effective and imperceptible, especially when incorporating textual reviews.

Method: Proposes RAGAN framework that uses in-context learning capabilities of multimodal foundation models with demonstration retrieval and text style transfer. Features a jailbreaker, instructional agent, and guardian for collaborative optimization to improve attack transferability and imperceptibility.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets show RAGAN achieves state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance, demonstrating superior effectiveness in manipulating recommendations.

Conclusion: The proposed RAGAN framework successfully enhances fake profile quality using multimodal foundation models, providing insights into recommender system robustness while achieving high attack transferability and imperceptibility.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that recommender systems (RSs) are highly
vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, where malicious actors inject fake user
profiles, including a group of well-designed fake ratings, to manipulate
recommendations. Due to security and privacy constraints in practice, attackers
typically possess limited knowledge of the victim system and thus need to craft
profiles that have transferability across black-box RSs. To maximize the attack
impact, the profiles often remains imperceptible. However, generating such
high-quality profiles with the restricted resources is challenging. Some works
suggest incorporating fake textual reviews to strengthen the profiles; yet, the
poor quality of the reviews largely undermines the attack effectiveness and
imperceptibility under the practical setting.
  To tackle the above challenges, in this paper, we propose to enhance the
quality of the review text by harnessing in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of multimodal foundation models. To this end, we introduce a demonstration
retrieval algorithm and a text style transfer strategy to augment the navie
ICL. Specifically, we propose a novel practical attack framework named RAGAN to
generate high-quality fake user profiles, which can gain insights into the
robustness of RSs. The profiles are generated by a jailbreaker and
collaboratively optimized on an instructional agent and a guardian to improve
the attack transferability and imperceptibility. Comprehensive experiments on
various real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGAN achieves the
state-of-the-art poisoning attack performance.

TL;DR: IPIGuard is a defense mechanism against Indirect Prompt Injection attacks on LLM agents by modeling task execution as traversal over a Tool Dependency Graph, decoupling planning from external data interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses rely on model's inherent security assumptions without structural constraints, leaving agents vulnerable to malicious tool invocations from untrusted data sources.

Method: Proposes IPIGuard that models agent task execution as traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph (TDG), explicitly decoupling action planning from external data interaction.

Result: Experiments on AgentDojo benchmark show IPIGuard achieves superior balance between effectiveness and robustness, significantly reducing unintended tool invocations.

Conclusion: IPIGuard enhances robustness against IPI attacks and paves the way for safer agentic systems in dynamic environments by preventing malicious tool invocations at the source.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are widely deployed in real-world
applications, where they leverage tools to retrieve and manipulate external
data for complex tasks. However, when interacting with untrusted data sources
(e.g., fetching information from public websites), tool responses may contain
injected instructions that covertly influence agent behaviors and lead to
malicious outcomes, a threat referred to as Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI).
Existing defenses typically rely on advanced prompting strategies or auxiliary
detection models. While these methods have demonstrated some effectiveness,
they fundamentally rely on assumptions about the model's inherent security,
which lacks structural constraints on agent behaviors. As a result, agents
still retain unrestricted access to tool invocations, leaving them vulnerable
to stronger attack vectors that can bypass the security guardrails of the
model. To prevent malicious tool invocations at the source, we propose a novel
defensive task execution paradigm, called IPIGuard, which models the agents'
task execution process as a traversal over a planned Tool Dependency Graph
(TDG). By explicitly decoupling action planning from interaction with external
data, IPIGuard significantly reduces unintended tool invocations triggered by
injected instructions, thereby enhancing robustness against IPI attacks.
Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark show that IPIGuard achieves a superior
balance between effectiveness and robustness, paving the way for the
development of safer agentic systems in dynamic environments.

Motivation: To explore the broader landscape of many-body memory systems in 2D, as only Toom's rule was well-studied despite the potential for diverse information storage mechanisms in physical systems.

Method: Combination of rigorous mathematical proofs and machine learning approaches to discover and analyze various local non-equilibrium dynamics that function as robust memories.

Result: Discovered multiple distinct 2D memories with qualitatively different error correction mechanisms, including systems with ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations and memories that only preserve information in the presence of noise.

Conclusion: The physics of many-body memories is significantly richer than previously realized, showing that physical systems can achieve robust information storage through many distinct mechanisms beyond the known Toom's rule.

Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local
non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions
for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary
perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.
Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show
that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories
that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have
ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the
presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can
perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that
the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.

Abstract: In this work, we highlight the transformative potential of Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI, in
the insurance sector. We consider and emphasize the unique opportunities,
challenges, and potential pathways in insurance amid rapid performance
improvements, increased open-source access, decreasing deployment costs, and
the complexity of LLM or agentic AI frameworks. To bring it closer to home, we
identify critical gaps in the African insurance market and highlight key local
efforts, players, and partnership opportunities. Finally, we call upon
actuaries, insurers, regulators, and tech leaders to a collaborative effort
aimed at creating inclusive, sustainable, and equitable AI strategies and
solutions: by and for Africans.
