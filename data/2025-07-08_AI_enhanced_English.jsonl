However, as these\nmodels scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the\nquadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental\ncomputational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where\nattention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them,\nleading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the\nCompressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that\nreimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By\nprojecting high dimensional key and value representations into a\nlower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing\nthe attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly\nreduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to\nvLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual\nrepresentations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high,\nand in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to\nLLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit\nfrom structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them\nparticularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal\nmathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision\nlanguage pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks,\nhighlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient\nsolution for next generation multimodal transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "CSAT introduces compressed sensing to reduce attention complexity in Vision-Language Models (vLLMs), maintaining performance while improving efficiency.", "motivation": "The quadratic complexity of standard attention in vLLMs creates computational bottlenecks, especially for longer video sequences and richer language descriptions.", "method": "CSAT projects high-dimensional key/value representations into a lower-dimensional subspace using random measurement matrices and reconstructs attention outputs with sparse recovery algorithms.", "result": "CSAT reduces attention complexity while preserving semantic fidelity, leveraging the inherent compressibility of visual and textual representations.", "conclusion": "CSAT offers a scalable, interpretable, and resource-efficient solution for next-generation multimodal transformers."}}

In this paper, by casting such DG-based HAR as a\ncasual inference problem, we propose a causality-inspired representation\nlearning algorithm for cross-domain activity recognition. To this end, an\nearly-forking two-branch framework is designed, where two separate branches are\nrespectively responsible for learning casual and non-causal features, while an\nindependence-based Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion is employed to\nimplicitly disentangling them. Additionally, an inhomogeneous domain sampling\nstrategy is designed to enhance disentanglement, while a category-aware domain\nperturbation layer is performed to prevent representation collapse. Extensive\nexperiments on several public HAR benchmarks demonstrate that our\ncausality-inspired approach significantly outperforms eleven related\nstate-of-the-art baselines under cross-person, cross-dataset, and\ncross-position settings.

The core issue is the\ncurse of rarity. Over time, novel events occur infrequently, and standard\nlogging methods fail to capture them effectively. As a result, large volumes of\nredundant data are stored, while critical novel cases are diluted, leading to\nbiased datasets. This work presents a real-time data selection method focused\non object-level novelty detection to build more balanced and diverse datasets.\nThe method assigns a data-driven novelty score to image frames using a novel\ndynamic Mean Shift algorithm. It models normal content based on mean and\ncovariance statistics to identify frames with novel objects, discarding those\nwith redundant elements. The main findings show that reducing the training\ndataset size with this method can improve model performance, whereas higher\nredundancy tends to degrade it. Moreover, as data redundancy increases, more\naggressive filtering becomes both possible and beneficial. While random\nsampling can offer some gains, it often leads to overfitting and\nunpredictability in outcomes. The proposed method supports real-time deployment\nwith 32 frames per second and is constant over time.
