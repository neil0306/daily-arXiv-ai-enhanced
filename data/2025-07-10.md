TL;DR: The paper introduces the Gemini 2.X model family, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash, highlighting their advanced capabilities in coding, reasoning, and multimodal tasks, as well as cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To present the latest advancements in the Gemini model family, showcasing improved performance, multimodal understanding, and cost-effective solutions for agentic workflows.

Method: Developed Gemini 2.5 Pro and 2.5 Flash models, focusing on long-context processing, multimodal understanding, and reasoning, while optimizing compute and latency for efficiency.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance in coding and reasoning, with enhanced video processing. Gemini 2.5 Flash offers high reasoning abilities at lower compute costs.

Conclusion: The Gemini 2.X models provide a versatile range of capabilities and cost-efficiency, enabling advanced agentic problem-solving across various applications.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and
Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite
models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA
performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its
incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that
excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours
of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and
reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini
2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute
and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high
performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model
generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing
users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic
problem solving.

TL;DR: The paper examines multilingual linguistic calibration in LLMs, revealing overconfidence and overreliance risks across languages, with variations in epistemic marker usage and user reliance behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the safety of LLMs globally by assessing linguistic calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance risks across languages.

Method: Analyzed LLM-generated epistemic markers in five languages and measured human reliance rates on confident and uncertain generations.

Result: LLMs are overconfident cross-linguistically but sensitive to linguistic variation. Users overrely on confident generations, with reliance behaviors differing by language.

Conclusion: Multilingual linguistic calibration is challenging, emphasizing the need for culturally and linguistically contextualized safety evaluations.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Previous work has shown that LLMs are
linguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident
generations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,
'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we
study the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,
and overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a
global context.
  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first
analyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that
while LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to
documented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers
of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and
Mandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that
while users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,
reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely
significantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.
Taken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident
model generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of
multilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and
linguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.

*Kiarash Zahirnia,Zahra Golpayegani,Walid Ahmad,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETT extends context length of short-context LLMs with linear computation and constant memory, improving accuracy by 30% on LongBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quadratic computation and memory overhead in Transformer-based LLMs limit their use for long sequences.

Method: ETT fine-tunes model parameters on overlapping subsequences of the input context, focusing on specific Transformer modules.

Result: Extends context length up to 32 times (1k to 32k tokens) with 30% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning specific modules (e.g., second FFN layer) is more effective than full fine-tuning for accuracy gains.

Abstract: Transformer-based Language Models' computation and memory overhead increase
quadratically as a function of sequence length. The quadratic cost poses
challenges when employing LLMs for processing long sequences. In this work, we
introduce \ourmodelacronym~(Extend at Test-Time), method for extending the
context length of short context Transformer-based LLMs, with constant memory
requirement and linear computation overhead. ETT enable the extension of the
context length at test-time by efficient fine-tuning the model's parameters on
the input context, chunked into overlapping small subsequences. We evaluate ETT
on LongBench by extending the context length of GPT-Large and Phi-2 up to 32
times, increasing from 1k to 32k tokens. This results in up to a 30 percent
improvement in the model's accuracy. We also study how context can be stored in
LLM's weights effectively and efficiently. Through a detailed ablation study,
we examine which Transformer modules are most beneficial to fine-tune at
test-time. Interestingly, we find that fine-tuning the second layer of the FFNs
is more effective than full fine-tuning, leading to a further improvement in
the models' accuracy.

*Casey Kennington,David Schlangen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes unifying formal, distributional, and grounded semantic theories using the words-as-classifiers model, supported by cognitive science and experimental evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of individual semantic theories (formal, distributional, grounded) by integrating them into a unified framework.

Method: Review of literature, cognitive science insights, and a small experiment to support the words-as-classifiers model.

Result: The words-as-classifiers model shows promise for unifying semantic theories and has been tested in dialogue settings.

Conclusion: A unified semantic model based on words-as-classifiers is feasible and beneficial, bridging gaps between existing theories.

Abstract: Formal, Distributional, and Grounded theories of computational semantics each
have their uses and their drawbacks. There has been a shift to ground models of
language by adding visual knowledge, and there has been a call to enrich models
of language with symbolic methods to gain the benefits from formal,
distributional, and grounded theories. In this paper, we attempt to make the
case that one potential path forward in unifying all three semantic fields is
paved with the words-as-classifier model, a model of word-level grounded
semantics that has been incorporated into formalisms and distributional
language models in the literature, and it has been well-tested within
interactive dialogue settings. We review that literature, motivate the
words-as-classifiers model with an appeal to recent work in cognitive science,
and describe a small experiment. Finally, we sketch a model of semantics
unified through words-as-classifiers.

### [5] [Evaluating Morphological Alignment of Tokenizers in 70 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06378)
*Catherine Arnett,Marisa Hudspeth,Brendan O'Connor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates tokenizer quality by expanding MorphScore to 70 languages and correlating morphological alignment with downstream task performance, finding it insufficient for explaining model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords and whether morphological alignment impacts model performance.

Method: Expanded MorphScore to 70 languages, evaluated alignment scores, and correlated them with downstream task performance for five pre-trained models.

Result: Morphological alignment explains little variance in model performance, indicating it's not a key measure of tokenization quality for models.

Conclusion: Morphological alignment alone is inadequate for evaluating tokenizer quality relevant to model performance.

Abstract: While tokenization is a key step in language modeling, with effects on model
training and performance, it remains unclear how to effectively evaluate
tokenizer quality. One proposed dimension of tokenizer quality is the extent to
which tokenizers preserve linguistically meaningful subwords, aligning token
boundaries with morphological boundaries within a word. We expand MorphScore
(Arnett & Bergen, 2025), which previously covered 22 languages, to support a
total of 70 languages. The updated MorphScore offers more flexibility in
evaluation and addresses some of the limitations of the original version. We
then correlate our alignment scores with downstream task performance for five
pre-trained languages models on seven tasks, with at least one task in each of
the languages in our sample. We find that morphological alignment does not
explain very much variance in model performance, suggesting that morphological
alignment alone does not measure dimensions of tokenization quality relevant to
model performance.

*Matilde Marcolli,Riny Huijbregts,Richard K. Larson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends syntactic structures to hypermagmas and formulates them as colored operads, linking movement rules and phase structures to operad generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify syntactic structures (like head functions, c-command, and m-command) with algebraic frameworks (magmas and hypermagmas) and relate them to colored operads for a formal treatment of syntax.

Method: Extends magma structures to hypermagmas, formulates syntactic objects as colored operads, and relates filtering rules to colored Merge.

Result: Shows compatibility between syntactic relations (e.g., movement rules, phase structures) and colored operads, unifying them under a single framework.

Conclusion: The framework provides a formal, algebraic treatment of syntactic structures, subsuming movement rules and phase constraints into colored operad generators.

Abstract: We show that head functions on syntactic objects extend the magma structure
to a hypermagma, with the c-command relation compatible with the magma
operation and the m-command relation with the hypermagma. We then show that the
structure of head and complement and specifier, additional modifier positions,
and the structure of phases in the Extended Projection can be formulated as a
bud generating system of a colored operad, in a form similar to the structure
of theta roles. We also show that, due to the special form of the colored
operad generators, the filtering of freely generated syntactic objects by these
coloring rules can be equivalently formulated as a filtering in the course of
structure formation via a colored Merge, which can in turn be related to the
hypermagma structure. The rules on movement by Internal Merge with respect to
phases, the Extended Projection Principle, Empty Category Principle, and Phase
Impenetrability Condition are all subsumed into the form of the colored operad
generators. Movement compatibilities between the phase structure and the theta
roles assignments can then be formulated in terms of the respective colored
operads and a transduction of colored operads.

### [7] [PERK: Long-Context Reasoning as Parameter-Efficient Test-Time Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06415)
*Zeming Chen,Angelika Romanou,Gail Weiss,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge) is a scalable method for encoding long input contexts efficiently using gradient updates to a lightweight adapter at test time, outperforming standard baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context reasoning is challenging due to noisy inputs and memory-intensive meta-learning methods, necessitating a more efficient approach.

Method: PERK uses nested optimization loops: an inner loop encodes contexts into a low-rank adapter (LoRA), while the outer loop learns to reason over the encoded information.

Result: PERK achieves significant performance gains (up to 90% for smaller models and 27% for larger ones) and is robust to reasoning complexity and context length.

Conclusion: PERK is memory-efficient at inference and outperforms prompt-based methods, making it suitable for long-context reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Long-context reasoning requires accurately identifying relevant information
in extensive, noisy input contexts. Previous research shows that using
test-time learning to encode context directly into model parameters can
effectively enable reasoning over noisy information. However, meta-learning
methods for enabling test-time learning are prohibitively memory-intensive,
preventing their application to long context settings. In this work, we propose
PERK (Parameter Efficient Reasoning over Knowledge), a scalable approach for
learning to encode long input contexts using gradient updates to a lightweight
model adapter at test time. Specifically, PERK employs two nested optimization
loops in a meta-training phase. The inner loop rapidly encodes contexts into a
low-rank adapter (LoRA) that serves as a parameter-efficient memory module for
the base model. Concurrently, the outer loop learns to use the updated adapter
to accurately recall and reason over relevant information from the encoded long
context. Our evaluations on several long-context reasoning tasks show that PERK
significantly outperforms the standard prompt-based long-context baseline,
achieving average absolute performance gains of up to 90% for smaller models
(GPT-2) and up to 27% for our largest evaluated model, Qwen-2.5-0.5B. In
general, PERK is more robust to reasoning complexity, length extrapolation, and
the locations of relevant information in contexts. Finally, we show that while
PERK is memory-intensive during training, it scales more efficiently at
inference time than prompt-based long-context inference.

### [8] [Reward Models Can Improve Themselves: Reward-Guided Adversarial Failure Mode Discovery for Robust Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06419)
*Pankayaraj Pathmanathan,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes REFORM, a self-improving reward modeling framework to enhance robustness by identifying and patching failure modes in reward models without relying on prior knowledge of preference distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial perturbations due to the complexity of human preferences and limited dataset coverage. Existing methods rely on prior knowledge, limiting practicality.

Method: The authors introduce a preference-distribution agnostic method for discovering failure modes via reward-guided controlled decoding. REFORM uses adversarial examples to augment training data and improve robustness.

Result: REFORM significantly improves robustness on Anthropic HH and PKU Beavertails datasets without sacrificing reward quality. It also enhances alignment by removing spurious correlations.

Conclusion: REFORM is a practical and effective framework for improving reward model robustness and alignment, demonstrated through empirical validation.

Abstract: Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large
language models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model
finetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent
complexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,
reward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial
perturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically
rely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,
limiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is
unavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution
agnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided
controlled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving
reward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model
itself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial
examples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward
model's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference
datasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate
that it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.
Notably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in
downstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing
spurious correlations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dictionary-learning method with sparse autoencoders to decompose LLMs, improving interpretability and performance on tasks like math and metaphor detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are often seen as black-box systems, limiting trust and performance optimization. This work aims to enhance interpretability and task performance.

Method: A dictionary-learning approach with sparse autoencoders is used to decompose LLMs and extract monosemantic features from polysemantic neurons.

Result: The method identifies model-internal misunderstandings and improves downstream task performance, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition enhances LLM interpretability and performance, demonstrating practical benefits for downstream applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are traditionally viewed as black-box
algorithms, therefore reducing trustworthiness and obscuring potential
approaches to increasing performance on downstream tasks. In this work, we
apply an effective LLM decomposition method using a dictionary-learning
approach with sparse autoencoders. This helps extract monosemantic features
from polysemantic LLM neurons. Remarkably, our work identifies model-internal
misunderstanding, allowing the automatic reformulation of the prompts with
additional annotations to improve the interpretation by LLMs. Moreover, this
approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement in downstream
tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and metaphor detection.

### [10] [Temporal Analysis of Climate Policy Discourse: Insights from Dynamic Embedded Topic Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06435)
*Rafiu Adekoya Badekale,Adewale Akinfaderin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dynamic embedded topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse, revealing shifts in themes over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding policy language evolution is crucial for addressing global challenges like climate change, but traditional methods are inefficient for complex, high-dimensional data.

Method: The study applies DETM to UNFCCC policy decisions (1995-2023), capturing temporal topic dynamics through preprocessing, model training, and visualization.

Result: DETM identifies shifts from early themes (e.g., greenhouse gases) to recent focuses (e.g., implementation, finance), proving scalable and effective.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for policy discourse analysis and can be extended to other domains with future refinements.

Abstract: Understanding how policy language evolves over time is critical for assessing
global responses to complex challenges such as climate change. Temporal
analysis helps stakeholders, including policymakers and researchers, to
evaluate past priorities, identify emerging themes, design governance
strategies, and develop mitigation measures. Traditional approaches, such as
manual thematic coding, are time-consuming and limited in capturing the
complex, interconnected nature of global policy discourse. With the increasing
relevance of unsupervised machine learning, these limitations can be addressed,
particularly under high-volume, complex, and high-dimensional data conditions.
In this work, we explore a novel approach that applies the dynamic embedded
topic model (DETM) to analyze the evolution of global climate policy discourse.
A probabilistic model designed to capture the temporal dynamics of topics over
time. We collected a corpus of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) policy decisions from 1995 to 2023, excluding 2020 due to the
postponement of COP26 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model reveals
shifts from early emphases on greenhouse gases and international conventions to
recent focuses on implementation, technical collaboration, capacity building,
finance, and global agreements. Section 3 presents the modeling pipeline,
including preprocessing, model training, and visualization of temporal word
distributions. Our results show that DETM is a scalable and effective tool for
analyzing the evolution of global policy discourse. Section 4 discusses the
implications of these findings and we concluded with future directions and
refinements to extend this approach to other policy domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAPO extends GRPO to improve multimodal reasoning by integrating perception learning, achieving 4.4% overall and 8.0% vision-dependent task improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods underperform in multimodal tasks due to poor visual perception, which PAPO aims to address.

Method: PAPO introduces an Implicit Perception Loss via KL divergence in GRPO, enhancing perception without extra data or models.

Result: PAPO improves performance by 4.4% overall and 8.0% on vision-heavy tasks, reducing perception errors by 30.5%.

Conclusion: PAPO advances RLVR by integrating perception-aware supervision, enabling better visually grounded reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven to be a
highly effective strategy for endowing Large Language Models (LLMs) with robust
multi-step reasoning abilities. However, its design and optimizations remain
tailored to purely textual domains, resulting in suboptimal performance when
applied to multimodal reasoning tasks. In particular, we observe that a major
source of error in current multimodal reasoning lies in the perception of
visual inputs. To address this bottleneck, we propose Perception-Aware Policy
Optimization (PAPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that encourages
the model to learn to perceive while learning to reason, entirely from internal
supervision signals. Notably, PAPO does not rely on additional data curation,
external reward models, or proprietary models. Specifically, we introduce the
Implicit Perception Loss in the form of a KL divergence term to the GRPO
objective, which, despite its simplicity, yields significant overall
improvements (4.4%) on diverse multimodal benchmarks. The improvements are more
pronounced, approaching 8.0%, on tasks with high vision dependency. We also
observe a substantial reduction (30.5%) in perception errors, indicating
improved perceptual capabilities with PAPO. We conduct comprehensive analysis
of PAPO and identify a unique loss hacking issue, which we rigorously analyze
and mitigate through a Double Entropy Loss. Overall, our work introduces a
deeper integration of perception-aware supervision into RLVR learning
objectives and lays the groundwork for a new RL framework that encourages
visually grounded reasoning. Project page: https://mikewangwzhl.github.io/PAPO.

*Xin Su,Sungduk Yu,Phillip Howard,Steven Bethard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel approach to time normalization by framing it as a code generation task using the SCATE framework, leveraging LLMs for data augmentation and achieving strong performance with small, deployable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional time normalization systems are limited by the ISO-TimeML schema, struggling with complex temporal expressions. The work aims to improve expressivity and accuracy.

Method: The task is reformulated as code generation using the SCATE framework. A Python library is implemented, and LLMs are used to generate executable SCATE code and synthesize annotated data.

Result: Small models trained on augmented data outperform LLMs, achieving practical, accurate, and interpretable time normalization.

Conclusion: The SCATE framework and LLM-augmented data enable effective time normalization, surpassing traditional methods and LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Time normalization is the task of converting natural language temporal
expressions into machine-readable representations. It underpins many downstream
applications in information retrieval, question answering, and clinical
decision-making. Traditional systems based on the ISO-TimeML schema limit
expressivity and struggle with complex constructs such as compositional,
event-relative, and multi-span time expressions. In this work, we introduce a
novel formulation of time normalization as a code generation task grounded in
the SCATE framework, which defines temporal semantics through symbolic and
compositional operators. We implement a fully executable SCATE Python library
and demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can generate executable SCATE
code. Leveraging this capability, we develop an automatic data augmentation
pipeline using LLMs to synthesize large-scale annotated data with code-level
validation. Our experiments show that small, locally deployable models trained
on this augmented data can achieve strong performance, outperforming even their
LLM parents and enabling practical, accurate, and interpretable time
normalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates linear attention models in hybrid architectures, finding that superior standalone models don't always perform well in hybrids. Optimal recall requires a balance of linear and full attention layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with long sequences due to quadratic complexity, leading to hybrid architectures. However, the choice of linear attention components is underexplored.

Method: Systematic evaluation of six linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios, training 72 models (340M and 1.3B parameters).

Result: Recall improves with more full attention layers, especially below a 3:1 ratio. Selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled forgetting are key for effective hybrids.

Conclusion: Recommended architectures include HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a 3:1 to 6:1 linear-to-full ratio for efficient Transformer-level recall.

Abstract: Transformers face quadratic complexity and memory issues with long sequences,
prompting the adoption of linear attention mechanisms using fixed-size hidden
states. However, linear models often suffer from limited recall performance,
leading to hybrid architectures that combine linear and full attention layers.
Despite extensive hybrid architecture research, the choice of linear attention
component has not been deeply explored. We systematically evaluate various
linear attention models across generations - vector recurrences to advanced
gating mechanisms - both standalone and hybridized. To enable this
comprehensive analysis, we trained and open-sourced 72 models: 36 at 340M
parameters (20B tokens) and 36 at 1.3B parameters (100B tokens), covering six
linear attention variants across five hybridization ratios. Benchmarking on
standard language modeling and recall tasks reveals that superior standalone
linear models do not necessarily excel in hybrids. While language modeling
remains stable across linear-to-full attention ratios, recall significantly
improves with increased full attention layers, particularly below a 3:1 ratio.
Our study highlights selective gating, hierarchical recurrence, and controlled
forgetting as critical for effective hybrid models. We recommend architectures
such as HGRN-2 or GatedDeltaNet with a linear-to-full ratio between 3:1 and 6:1
to achieve Transformer-level recall efficiently. Our models are open-sourced at

Motivation: Ensuring robust verbal confidence in LLMs is critical for transparency, trust, and safety in high-stakes human-AI interactions.

Method: A novel framework for attacking verbal confidence via perturbation and jailbreak methods, tested across prompting strategies, model sizes, and domains.

Result: Attacks significantly undermine confidence estimates, causing frequent answer changes; current defenses are ineffective.

Conclusion: Urgent need for more robust confidence mechanisms in LLMs, as subtle semantic changes can mislead confidence.

Abstract: Robust verbal confidence generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for the deployment of LLMs to ensure transparency, trust, and safety in
human-AI interactions across many high-stakes applications. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive study on the robustness of verbal confidence
under adversarial attacks. We introduce a novel framework for attacking verbal
confidence scores through both perturbation and jailbreak-based methods, and
show that these attacks can significantly jeopardize verbal confidence
estimates and lead to frequent answer changes. We examine a variety of
prompting strategies, model sizes, and application domains, revealing that
current confidence elicitation methods are vulnerable and that commonly used
defence techniques are largely ineffective or counterproductive. Our findings
underscore the urgent need to design more robust mechanisms for confidence
expression in LLMs, as even subtle semantic-preserving modifications can lead
to misleading confidence in responses.

TL;DR: A novel approach for translating puns from English to French using large language models and specialized techniques, achieving top results in a competition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of translating wordplay, which confounds both human translators and machine systems, by capturing linguistic creativity and humor.

Method: A three-stage approach: baseline with large language models, guided chain-of-thought with phonetic-semantic embeddings, and a generator-discriminator framework for pun evaluation.

Result: Achieved first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition, evaluated by expert native French speakers.

Conclusion: Advances understanding of leveraging language models for wordplay translation, bridging translation studies and computational linguistics.

Abstract: Translating wordplay across languages presents unique challenges that have
long confounded both professional human translators and machine translation
systems. This research proposes a novel approach for translating puns from
English to French by combining state-of-the-art large language models with
specialized techniques for wordplay generation.
  Our methodology employs a three-stage approach. First, we establish a
baseline using multiple frontier large language models with feedback based on a
new contrastive learning dataset. Second, we implement a guided
chain-of-thought pipeline with combined phonetic-semantic embeddings. Third, we
implement a multi-agent generator-discriminator framework for evaluating and
regenerating puns with feedback.
  Moving beyond the limitations of literal translation, our methodology's
primary objective is to capture the linguistic creativity and humor of the
source text wordplay, rather than simply duplicating its vocabulary. Our best
runs earned first and second place in the CLEF JOKER 2025 Task 2 competition
where they were evaluated manually by expert native French speakers.
  This research addresses a gap between translation studies and computational
linguistics by implementing linguistically-informed techniques for wordplay
translation, advancing our understanding of how language models can be
leveraged to handle the complex interplay between semantic ambiguity, phonetic
similarity, and the implicit cultural and linguistic awareness needed for
successful humor.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SpindleKV is a novel KV cache reduction method for LLMs, balancing shallow and deep layers with attention-weight eviction and codebook-based replacement, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of high memory consumption in LLM inference due to KV cache redundancy, especially in shallow layers.

Method: Uses attention-weight eviction for deep layers and a codebook-based replacement for shallow layers, leveraging KV cache similarity and addressing GQA issues.

Result: Achieves better KV cache reduction while maintaining or improving model performance on benchmarks with three LLMs.

Conclusion: SpindleKV effectively reduces KV cache size without compromising performance, offering a balanced solution for LLM inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive accomplishments in
recent years. However, the increasing memory consumption of KV cache has
possessed a significant challenge to the inference system. Eviction methods
have revealed the inherent redundancy within the KV cache, demonstrating its
potential for reduction, particularly in deeper layers. However, KV cache
reduction for shallower layers has been found to be insufficient. Based on our
observation that, the KV cache exhibits a high degree of similarity. Based on
this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV,
which balances both shallow and deep layers. For deep layers, we employ an
attention weight based eviction method, while for shallow layers, we apply a
codebook based replacement approach which is learnt by similarity and merging
policy. Moreover, SpindleKV addressed the Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) dilemma
faced by other attention based eviction methods. Experiments on two common
benchmarks with three different LLMs shown that SpindleKV obtained better KV
cache reduction effect compared to baseline methods, while preserving similar
or even better model performance.

TL;DR: InvestAlign proposes a framework to create SFT datasets for LLMs using theoretical solutions to simple investment problems, avoiding costly real-user data. It shows faster convergence and better alignment with real-user behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of aligning LLMs with investor decision-making under herd behavior, given the scarcity and privacy risks of real-user data for SFT.

Method: InvestAlign constructs SFT datasets from theoretical solutions to simple optimal investment problems, then fine-tunes LLMs (e.g., InvestAgent) with this data.

Result: LLMs trained with InvestAlign data achieve faster convergence and closer alignment to real-user behavior than pre-SFT models.

Conclusion: InvestAlign is a promising solution for aligning LLMs with investor decision-making, especially in herd behavior scenarios, without relying on costly real-user data.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes
under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which
grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed
for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM
outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data
imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose InvestAlign,
a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging
theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather
than complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training
LLMs with InvestAlign-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than
using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we
develop InvestAgent, an LLM agent fine-tuned with InvestAlign, which
demonstrates significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT
models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our
proposed InvestAlign as a promising approach with the potential to address
complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor
decision-making processes under herd behavior. Our code is publicly available

### [18] [Large Language Model for Extracting Complex Contract Information in Industrial Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06539)
*Yunyang Cao,Yanjun Li,Silong Dai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method for constructing high-quality datasets for contract info extraction, using GPT-4/3.5 for annotations, data augmentation, and fine-tuning a large language model, achieving high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for efficient and accurate contract information extraction in industrial scenarios.

Method: Cluster analysis of contract texts, GPT-4/3.5 for key info extraction, data augmentation via GPT-3.5, and fine-tuning a large language model.

Result: High field recall, precision, and parsing efficiency; LoRA, data balancing, and augmentation improve accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient solution for industrial contract info extraction, enhancing model performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-quality dataset construction method for complex
contract information extraction tasks in industrial scenarios and fine-tunes a
large language model based on this dataset. Firstly, cluster analysis is
performed on industrial contract texts, and GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 are used to
extract key information from the original contract data, obtaining high-quality
data annotations. Secondly, data augmentation is achieved by constructing new
texts, and GPT-3.5 generates unstructured contract texts from randomly combined
keywords, improving model robustness. Finally, the large language model is
fine-tuned based on the high-quality dataset. Experimental results show that
the model achieves excellent overall performance while ensuring high field
recall and precision and considering parsing efficiency. LoRA, data balancing,
and data augmentation effectively enhance model accuracy and robustness. The
proposed method provides a novel and efficient solution for industrial contract
information extraction tasks.

### [19] [The Flaws of Others: An LLM-driven Framework for Scientific Knowledge Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565)
*Juan B. Gutiérrez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a discursive-network model for human-LLM interactions, defining invalidation hazards and proposing peer review to stabilize truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of factual, logical, or structural breaches (invalidation) in human-LLM interactions and improve reliability.

Method: Develops a mathematical model of discursive networks, identifies four invalidation hazards, and introduces the FOO algorithm for peer review.

Result: Networks with drift and self-repair stabilize modestly; fabrication increases error rates. Peer review shifts systems to truth-dominant states.

Conclusion: Reliability in human-LLM interactions requires networked models with peer review, not perfect individual models.

Abstract: Large-language models turn writing into a live exchange between humans and
software. We capture this new medium with a discursive-network model that
treats people and LLMs as equal nodes and tracks how their statements
circulate. Broadening the focus from isolated hallucinations, we define
invalidation (any factual, logical, or structural breach) and show it follows
four hazards: drift from truth, self-repair, fresh fabrication, and external
detection. A general mathematical model of discursive networks is developed to
provide valuable insights: A network governed only by drift and self-repair
stabilizes at a modest error rate; adding fabrication reproduces the high rates
seen in current LLMs. Giving each false claim even a small chance of peer
review shifts the system to a truth-dominant state. We operationalize peer
review with the open-source \emph{Flaws-of-Others (FOO) algorithm}: a
configurable loop in which any set of agents critique one another while a
harmoniser merges their verdicts. The takeaway is practical and cultural:
reliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from
wiring imperfect ones into networks that keep each other honest.

*Srihari K B,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified food-domain QA framework combines a multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI, improving accuracy and diversity in food-related question answering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reliability and diversity in food QA by integrating structured knowledge (MMKG) with generative AI.

Method: Joint fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large, augmented by LLaVA/DeepSeek, and using a hybrid retrieval-generation strategy.

Result: Improves BERTScore by 16.2%, reduces FID by 37.8%, boosts CLIP alignment by 31.1%, and achieves 94.1% accurate image reuse and 85% adequacy in synthesis.

Conclusion: Combining structured knowledge and multimodal generation enhances food QA reliability and diversity.

Abstract: We propose a unified food-domain QA framework that combines a large-scale
multimodal knowledge graph (MMKG) with generative AI. Our MMKG links 13,000
recipes, 3,000 ingredients, 140,000 relations, and 14,000 images. We generate
40,000 QA pairs using 40 templates and LLaVA/DeepSeek augmentation. Joint
fine-tuning of Meta LLaMA 3.1-8B and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Large improves
BERTScore by 16.2\%, reduces FID by 37.8\%, and boosts CLIP alignment by
31.1\%. Diagnostic analyses-CLIP-based mismatch detection (35.2\% to 7.3\%) and
LLaVA-driven hallucination checks-ensure factual and visual fidelity. A hybrid
retrieval-generation strategy achieves 94.1\% accurate image reuse and 85\%
adequacy in synthesis. Our results demonstrate that structured knowledge and
multimodal generation together enhance reliability and diversity in food QA.

*Liliang Ren,Congcong Chen,Haoran Xu,Young Jin Kim,Adam Atkinson,Zheng Zhan,Jiankai Sun,Baolin Peng,Liyuan Liu,Shuohang Wang,Hao Cheng,Jianfeng Gao,Weizhu Chen,Yelong Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Gated Memory Unit (GMU) for efficient memory sharing in State Space Models (SSMs), applied in the SambaY architecture to enhance decoding efficiency and long-context performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works overlooked representation sharing between SSM layers, limiting efficiency. The paper aims to address this gap.

Method: Proposes GMU for memory sharing, integrated into SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture.

Result: SambaY improves decoding efficiency, preserves linear pre-filling time, and outperforms baselines like YOCO and Phi4-mini-Reasoning.

Conclusion: GMU and SambaY offer scalable, efficient solutions for sequence modeling, with superior performance in large-scale compute regimes.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

*Boshko Koloski,Senja Pollak,Roberto Navigli,Blaž Škrlj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FuDoBa combines LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific knowledge via Bayesian optimization, creating efficient, interpretable, and high-performing document representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based embeddings are often too generic or inefficient for domain-specific tasks, prompting the need for a tailored solution.

Method: FuDoBa integrates LLM embeddings with structured domain knowledge using Bayesian optimization, producing low-dimensional, task-relevant representations.

Result: FuDoBa matches or outperforms proprietary LLM-based embeddings on six datasets across two domains when paired with AutoML classifiers.

Conclusion: FuDoBa offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient alternative to LLM-based embeddings for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Building on the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
representations have dominated the document representation landscape, achieving
great performance on the document embedding benchmarks. However, the
high-dimensional, computationally expensive embeddings from LLMs tend to be
either too generic or inefficient for domain-specific applications. To address
these limitations, we introduce FuDoBa a Bayesian optimisation-based method
that integrates LLM-based embeddings with domain-specific structured knowledge,
sourced both locally and from external repositories like WikiData. This fusion
produces low-dimensional, task-relevant representations while reducing training
complexity and yielding interpretable early-fusion weights for enhanced
classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
six datasets in two domains, showing that when paired with robust AutoML-based
classifiers, our proposed representation learning approach performs on par
with, or surpasses, those produced solely by the proprietary LLM-based
embedding baselines.

### [23] [Expediting data extraction using a large language model (LLM) and scoping review protocol: a methodological study within a complex scoping review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06623)
*James Stewart-Evans,Emma Wilson,Tessa Langley,Andrew Prayle,Angela Hands,Karen Exley,Jo Leonardi-Bee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study tested Claude 3.5 Sonnet for data extraction in scoping reviews, finding high accuracy for simple tasks but low accuracy for complex ones, with overall low recall and F1 scores. LLM feedback improved protocol adaptation but detected few errors. Robust evaluation is needed before widespread use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the feasibility of using LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet to expedite resource-intensive data extraction in scoping reviews.

Method: Two protocol-based approaches were trialed for data extraction from 10 evidence sources in a scoping review, with performance evaluated for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

Result: High accuracy for simple data (83.3%-100%) but low for complex data (9.6%-15.8%). Overall precision >90%, but recall <25% and F1 <40%. LLM feedback improved protocols but detected few errors (5%).

Conclusion: LLMs show promise for simple tasks but require robust evaluation. Researchers should assess and report LLM performance for data extraction and review.

Abstract: The data extraction stages of reviews are resource-intensive, and researchers
may seek to expediate data extraction using online (large language models) LLMs
and review protocols. Claude 3.5 Sonnet was used to trial two approaches that
used a review protocol to prompt data extraction from 10 evidence sources
included in a case study scoping review. A protocol-based approach was also
used to review extracted data. Limited performance evaluation was undertaken
which found high accuracy for the two extraction approaches (83.3% and 100%)
when extracting simple, well-defined citation details; accuracy was lower (9.6%
and 15.8%) when extracting more complex, subjective data items. Considering all
data items, both approaches had precision >90% but low recall (<25%) and F1
scores (<40%). The context of a complex scoping review, open response types and
methodological approach likely impacted performance due to missed and
misattributed data. LLM feedback considered the baseline extraction accurate
and suggested minor amendments: four of 15 (26.7%) to citation details and 8 of
38 (21.1%) to key findings data items were considered to potentially add value.
However, when repeating the process with a dataset featuring deliberate errors,
only 2 of 39 (5%) errors were detected. Review-protocol-based methods used for
expediency require more robust performance evaluation across a range of LLMs
and review contexts with comparison to conventional prompt engineering
approaches. We recommend researchers evaluate and report LLM performance if
using them similarly to conduct data extraction or review extracted data. LLM
feedback contributed to protocol adaptation and may assist future review
protocol drafting.

### [24] [Elite Polarization in European Parliamentary Speeches: a Novel Measurement Approach Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06658)
*Gennadii Iakovlev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces an AI-based method to measure elite polarization by analyzing politicians' speeches, tracking who mentions whom and the emotional tone, creating an index of mutual hostility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify elite polarization by analyzing how politicians evaluate each other in parliamentary speeches, providing a data-driven approach to understanding political dynamics.

Method: Uses AI to detect actors and subjects in speeches, tracks mentions and emotional tone, and aggregates data by party and quarter to create a polarization index.

Result: The index shows validity by reacting to events like elections, crises, and power shifts, and provides a foundation for a 20-year EU-wide dataset.

Conclusion: The method effectively measures elite polarization and can be expanded for broader, long-term political analysis.

Abstract: This project introduces a new measure of elite polarization via actor and
subject detection using artificial intelligence. I identify when politicians
mention one another in parliamentary speeches, note who is speaking and who is
being addressed, and assess the emotional temperature behind these evaluations.
This maps how elites evaluate their various out-parties, allowing us to create
an index of mutual out-party hostility, that is, elite polarization. While I
analyzed polarization data over the past four decades for the UK, and two
decades for Hungary and Italy, my approach lays the groundwork for a
twenty-year, EU-wide time-series dataset on elite polarization. I obtain the
results that can be aggregated by party and quarter. The resulting index
demonstrates a good face validity: it reacts to events such as electoral
campaigns, country- and party-level crises, and to parties losing and assuming
power.

### [25] [CLI-RAG: A Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Clinically Structured and Context Aware Text Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06715)
*Garapati Keerthana,Manik Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLI-RAG is a framework for structured clinical text generation using LLMs, addressing challenges like unstructured patient data and long notes. It uses hierarchical chunking and dual-stage retrieval, outperforming baselines in alignment and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical applications of LLMs face challenges with unstructured, heterogeneous patient data and long, dense notes, making naive prompting ineffective.

Method: CLI-RAG employs hierarchical chunking and a dual-stage retrieval mechanism (global for note types, local for high-value content) to structure and ground text generation.

Result: Applied to MIMIC-III data, CLI-RAG achieves 87.7% alignment score (vs. 80.7% baseline) and shows high consistency across LLMs.

Conclusion: CLI-RAG improves clinical text generation by ensuring structured, relevant outputs, enhancing reproducibility, reliability, and trust.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), including zero-shot and few-shot paradigms,
have shown promising capabilities in clinical text generation. However,
real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly
unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2)
clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting
infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting
clinically relevant information.
  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a
domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text
generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy
that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific
dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types
using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content
within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.
  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual
hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset.
Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across
visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7%
baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also
demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior
essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust.

### [26] [On the Effect of Uncertainty on Layer-wise Inference Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06722)
*Sunwoo Kim,Haneul Yoo,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how uncertainty in LLMs affects their inference dynamics, finding that certain and uncertain predictions show similar probability trajectories across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally represent and process uncertainty, aiming to detect uncertainty and prevent hallucinations.

Method: Uses the Tuned Lens (a variant of the Logit Lens) to analyze layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens across 11 datasets and 5 models.

Result: Certain and uncertain predictions show aligned trajectories, with abrupt confidence increases at similar layers, though more competent models may process uncertainty differently.

Conclusion: Simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty may not be feasible, and interpretability tools can reveal how uncertainty impacts inference.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) internally represent and
process their predictions is central to detecting uncertainty and preventing
hallucinations. While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty
in their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they
process such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of
output token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are
largely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference
dynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to
analyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens
across 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with
higher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain
and uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at
similar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent
models may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the
feasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at
inference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may
be used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of KAConvText in diverse sentence classification tasks, including hate speech detection, news classification, and language identification.

Method: Investigates KAConvText with various embedding configurations (random, fastText) and classification heads (MLP, KAN), comparing it to standard CNNs and CNN-KAN.

Result: KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves top performance: 91.23% accuracy for hate speech, 92.66% for news, and 99.82% for language identification.

Conclusion: KAConvText is highly effective for sentence classification, especially with fine-tuned embeddings and MLP heads, offering both performance and interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents the first application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Convolution
for Text (KAConvText) in sentence classification, addressing three tasks:
imbalanced binary hate speech detection, balanced multiclass news
classification, and imbalanced multiclass ethnic language identification. We
investigate various embedding configurations, comparing random to fastText
embeddings in both static and fine-tuned settings, with embedding dimensions of
100 and 300 using CBOW and Skip-gram models. Baselines include standard CNNs
and CNNs augmented with a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CNN-KAN). In addition, we
investigated KAConvText with different classification heads - MLP and KAN,
where using KAN head supports enhanced interpretability. Results show that
KAConvText-MLP with fine-tuned fastText embeddings achieves the best
performance of 91.23% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9109) for hate speech detection,
92.66% accuracy (F1-score = 0.9267) for news classification, and 99.82%
accuracy (F1-score = 0.9982) for language identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of exploration in multilingual LLM-as-a-Judge paradigms and the inefficiencies of proprietary models or extensive training.

Method: Proposes CE-Judge, a checklist-based, training-free framework for multilingual evaluation using open-source LLMs.

Result: Outperforms baselines and performs comparably to GPT-4o across multiple languages and datasets.

Conclusion: CE-Judge offers an efficient, cost-effective alternative for multilingual text evaluation without training.

Abstract: Automated text evaluation has long been a central issue in Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recently, the field has shifted toward using Large Language
Models (LLMs) as evaluators-a trend known as the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. While
promising and easily adaptable across tasks, this approach has seen limited
exploration in multilingual contexts. Existing multilingual studies often rely
on proprietary models or require extensive training data for fine-tuning,
raising concerns about cost, time, and efficiency. In this paper, we propose
Checklist Engineering based LLM-as-a-Judge (CE-Judge), a training-free
framework that uses checklist intuition for multilingual evaluation with an
open-source model. Experiments across multiple languages and three benchmark
datasets, under both pointwise and pairwise settings, show that our method
generally surpasses the baselines and performs on par with the GPT-4o model.

TL;DR: DACP improves small LLMs for enterprise use, balancing cost and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many organizations lack infrastructure for large LLMs, making small LLMs (sLLMs) a practical alternative, but their performance is limited.

Method: Applied Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) to sLLMs across diverse models and domains.

Result: DACP-applied sLLMs showed significant performance gains in target domains while maintaining general capabilities.

Conclusion: DACP offers a cost-efficient, scalable solution for enterprise deployment of sLLMs.

Abstract: The emergence of open-source large language models (LLMs) has expanded
opportunities for enterprise applications; however, many organizations still
lack the infrastructure to deploy and maintain large-scale models. As a result,
small LLMs (sLLMs) have become a practical alternative, despite their inherent
performance limitations. While Domain Adaptive Continual Pretraining (DACP) has
been previously explored as a method for domain adaptation, its utility in
commercial applications remains under-examined. In this study, we validate the
effectiveness of applying a DACP-based recipe across diverse foundation models
and service domains. Through extensive experiments and real-world evaluations,
we demonstrate that DACP-applied sLLMs achieve substantial gains in target
domain performance while preserving general capabilities, offering a
cost-efficient and scalable solution for enterprise-level deployment.

*Matthew Anderson Hendricks,Alice Cicirello*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a strategy for automating the generation of dynamical system computational models using SysML diagrams, NLP, and LLMs, demonstrating improved performance over LLM-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To speed up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by leveraging domain knowledge and automation.

Method: A five-step strategy using SysML diagrams, NLP, and LLMs for tasks like dependency extraction and code generation.

Result: Improved performance in generating computational models, validated through case studies like a simple pendulum.

Conclusion: The approach is versatile and effective for automating dynamical system modeling, outperforming LLM-only methods.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of
engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and
expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational
model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of
interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is
implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language
diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies,
attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to
improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such
as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and
key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram
generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is
illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex
dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and
computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP
strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only.
The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or
computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via
an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved
performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a flexible test-time collaborative inference framework combining sequential and parallel reasoning, introducing semantic entropy (SE) to dynamically assess and control reasoning quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies and limitations in existing sequential and parallel reasoning paradigms for large language models (LLMs).

Method: Develop a collaborative inference framework leveraging both reasoning paradigms, using semantic entropy (SE) as an intrinsic quality metric.

Result: SE effectively quantifies semantic diversity and correlates negatively with accuracy, enabling dynamic control of reasoning.

Conclusion: The framework improves inference efficiency and quality by integrating sequential and parallel reasoning with SE.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated progress
toward artificial general intelligence, with inference-time scaling emerging as
a key technique. Contemporary approaches leverage either sequential reasoning
(iteratively extending chains of thought) or parallel reasoning (generating
multiple solutions simultaneously) to scale inference. However, both paradigms
face fundamental limitations: sequential scaling typically relies on arbitrary
token budgets for termination, leading to inefficiency or premature cutoff;
while parallel scaling often lacks coordination among parallel branches and
requires intrusive fine-tuning to perform effectively. In light of these
challenges, we aim to design a flexible test-time collaborative inference
framework that exploits the complementary strengths of both sequential and
parallel reasoning paradigms. Towards this goal, the core challenge lies in
developing an efficient and accurate intrinsic quality metric to assess model
responses during collaborative inference, enabling dynamic control and early
termination of the reasoning trace. To address this challenge, we introduce
semantic entropy (SE), which quantifies the semantic diversity of parallel
model responses and serves as a robust indicator of reasoning quality due to
its strong negative correlation with accuracy...

TL;DR: SETR improves retrieval in RAG by selecting passages collectively to meet query needs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reranking methods often fail to address complex queries in multi-hop QA by focusing only on individual passage relevance.

Method: Proposes SETR, a set-wise passage selection approach using Chain-of-Thought reasoning to identify query needs and select optimal passage sets.

Result: SETR outperforms proprietary and open-source baselines in answer correctness and retrieval quality on multi-hop RAG benchmarks.

Conclusion: SETR offers an efficient and effective alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) must ensure that retrieved
passages are not only individually relevant but also collectively form a
comprehensive set. Existing approaches primarily rerank top-k passages based on
their individual relevance, often failing to meet the information needs of
complex queries in multi-hop question answering. In this work, we propose a
set-wise passage selection approach and introduce SETR, which explicitly
identifies the information requirements of a query through Chain-of-Thought
reasoning and selects an optimal set of passages that collectively satisfy
those requirements. Experiments on multi-hop RAG benchmarks show that SETR
outperforms both proprietary LLM-based rerankers and open-source baselines in
terms of answer correctness and retrieval quality, providing an effective and
efficient alternative to traditional rerankers in RAG systems. The code is

Motivation: To address the challenges in implementing and maintaining AI evaluations, ensuring scalability, rigor, and reproducibility.

Method: Developed a structured cohort management framework, statistical methodologies for resampling and comparison, and systematic quality control processes.

Result: Identified the need for specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and community coordination in AI evaluations.

Conclusion: AI evaluations require unique practices beyond traditional software development to ensure effectiveness and reliability.

Abstract: AI evaluations have become critical tools for assessing large language model
capabilities and safety. This paper presents practical insights from eight
months of maintaining $inspect\_evals$, an open-source repository of 70+
community-contributed AI evaluations. We identify key challenges in
implementing and maintaining AI evaluations and develop solutions including:
(1) a structured cohort management framework for scaling community
contributions, (2) statistical methodologies for optimal resampling and
cross-model comparison with uncertainty quantification, and (3) systematic
quality control processes for reproducibility. Our analysis reveals that AI
evaluation requires specialized infrastructure, statistical rigor, and
community coordination beyond traditional software development practices.

TL;DR: SCoRE is a modular, cost-effective RE system for KG enrichment, combining contrastive learning and Bayesian kNN for robust performance. It introduces new metrics (CSD, P@R) and a benchmark dataset (Wiki20d), outperforming state-of-the-art methods with lower energy use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for adaptable, noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate with PLMs under low-supervision settings.

Method: Modular RE system (SCoRE) using supervised contrastive learning and Bayesian kNN for multi-label classification, avoiding finetuning.

Result: Matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, reduces energy consumption, and performs well despite noisy annotations.

Conclusion: SCoRE's minimal design offers efficiency, modularity, and scalability, making it ideal for real-world RE applications.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient knowledge graph (KG) enrichment leveraging
external corpora has intensified interest in relation extraction (RE),
particularly under low-supervision settings. To address the need for adaptable
and noise-resilient RE solutions that integrate seamlessly with pre-trained
large language models (PLMs), we introduce SCoRE, a modular and cost-effective
sentence-level RE system. SCoRE enables easy PLM switching, requires no
finetuning, and adapts smoothly to diverse corpora and KGs. By combining
supervised contrastive learning with a Bayesian k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
classifier for multi-label classification, it delivers robust performance
despite the noisy annotations of distantly supervised corpora. To improve RE
evaluation, we propose two novel metrics: Correlation Structure Distance (CSD),
measuring the alignment between learned relational patterns and KG structures,
and Precision at R (P@R), assessing utility as a recommender system. We also
release Wiki20d, a benchmark dataset replicating real-world RE conditions where
only KG-derived annotations are available. Experiments on five benchmarks show
that SCoRE matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while significantly
reducing energy consumption. Further analyses reveal that increasing model
complexity, as seen in prior work, degrades performance, highlighting the
advantages of SCoRE's minimal design. Combining efficiency, modularity, and
scalability, SCoRE stands as an optimal choice for real-world RE applications.

*Ziang Ye,Yang Zhang,Wentao Shi,Xiaoyu You,Fuli Feng,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GUI agents using LVLMs are vulnerable to backdoor attacks via visual grounding, demonstrated by the VisualTrap method, which hijacks agents with minimal poisoned data and stealthy triggers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The integration of GUI agents with personal devices raises security concerns, particularly unexplored threats like backdoor attacks targeting visual grounding.

Method: Proposes VisualTrap, a method to hijack visual grounding by misleading agents with poisoned data during pre-training, using stealthy triggers.

Result: VisualTrap successfully compromises agents with 5% poisoned data, generalizes across tasks and GUI environments, and remains effective post fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The study highlights critical vulnerabilities in GUI agents, urging further research into backdoor attack risks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary approach to automating human-machine
interactions, capable of autonomously operating personal devices (e.g., mobile
phones) or applications within the device to perform complex real-world tasks
in a human-like manner. However, their close integration with personal devices
raises significant security concerns, with many threats, including backdoor
attacks, remaining largely unexplored. This work reveals that the visual
grounding of GUI agent-mapping textual plans to GUI elements-can introduce
vulnerabilities, enabling new types of backdoor attacks. With backdoor attack
targeting visual grounding, the agent's behavior can be compromised even when
given correct task-solving plans. To validate this vulnerability, we propose
VisualTrap, a method that can hijack the grounding by misleading the agent to
locate textual plans to trigger locations instead of the intended targets.
VisualTrap uses the common method of injecting poisoned data for attacks, and
does so during the pre-training of visual grounding to ensure practical
feasibility of attacking. Empirical results show that VisualTrap can
effectively hijack visual grounding with as little as 5% poisoned data and
highly stealthy visual triggers (invisible to the human eye); and the attack
can be generalized to downstream tasks, even after clean fine-tuning. Moreover,
the injected trigger can remain effective across different GUI environments,
e.g., being trained on mobile/web and generalizing to desktop environments.
These findings underscore the urgent need for further research on backdoor
attack risks in GUI agents.

*Ziyan Liu,Chunxiao Fan,Haoran Lou,Yuexin Wu,Kaiwei Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MIND is a zero-shot harmful meme detection framework using multi-agent strategies, outperforming existing methods without annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The evolving nature of memes and lack of annotated data challenge traditional detection methods, necessitating a novel approach.

Method: MIND uses retrieval of similar memes, bi-directional insight derivation, and multi-agent debate for robust detection.

Result: MIND outperforms zero-shot approaches and generalizes well across datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: MIND provides a scalable, annotation-free solution for harmful meme detection, with code publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of memes on social media has highlighted the urgent need
for effective approaches to detect harmful content. However, traditional
data-driven approaches struggle to detect new memes due to their evolving
nature and the lack of up-to-date annotated data. To address this issue, we
propose MIND, a multi-agent framework for zero-shot harmful meme detection that
does not rely on annotated data. MIND implements three key strategies: 1) We
retrieve similar memes from an unannotated reference set to provide contextual
information. 2) We propose a bi-directional insight derivation mechanism to
extract a comprehensive understanding of similar memes. 3) We then employ a
multi-agent debate mechanism to ensure robust decision-making through reasoned
arbitration. Extensive experiments on three meme datasets demonstrate that our
proposed framework not only outperforms existing zero-shot approaches but also
shows strong generalization across different model architectures and parameter
scales, providing a scalable solution for harmful meme detection. The code is
available at https://github.com/destroy-lonely/MIND.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset (MPMCP) to explore whether multiple defendants and charges should be treated separately in legal judgment prediction (LJP). It evaluates LLMs across four scenarios, finding S4 (multiple defendants and charges) most challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the under-explored question of whether multiple defendants and charges should be treated separately in LJP, and to provide a practical dataset for evaluation.

Method: Introduces the MPMCP dataset and evaluates performance of legal LLMs across four scenarios (S1-S4) for charge and penalty term prediction tasks.

Result: S4 is the most challenging scenario, with performance drops varying by model (e.g., InternLM2 and Lawformer show significant F1-score and LogD differences).

Conclusion: The study highlights the complexity of multi-defendant and multi-charge scenarios in LJP, with model performance varying significantly, and provides a dataset for future research.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction offers a compelling method to aid legal
practitioners and researchers. However, the research question remains
relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated
separately in LJP? To address this, we introduce a new dataset namely
multi-person multi-charge prediction (MPMCP), and seek the answer by evaluating
the performance of several prevailing legal large language models (LLMs) on
four practical legal judgment scenarios: (S1) single defendant with a single
charge, (S2) single defendant with multiple charges, (S3) multiple defendants
with a single charge, and (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges. We
evaluate the dataset across two LJP tasks, i.e., charge prediction and penalty
term prediction. We have conducted extensive experiments and found that the
scenario involving multiple defendants and multiple charges (S4) poses the
greatest challenges, followed by S2, S3, and S1. The impact varies
significantly depending on the model. For example, in S4 compared to S1,
InternLM2 achieves approximately 4.5% lower F1-score and 2.8% higher LogD,
while Lawformer demonstrates around 19.7% lower F1-score and 19.0% higher LogD.

TL;DR: The paper explores using LLMs (Llama 3 and GPT-4o) to predict tutor strategies and student outcomes in tutoring dialogues, finding current models inadequate for strategy prediction despite its importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of online learning and AI tutoring agents highlights the need to predict tutor strategies and their impact on student outcomes, an underexplored area.

Method: The study evaluates modern LLMs (Llama 3 and GPT-4o) on two math tutoring dialogue datasets to predict tutor moves and student outcomes.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs struggle to predict tutor strategies, though these strategies significantly influence student outcomes.

Conclusion: More advanced methods are needed to effectively predict tutor strategies in dialogues, given their impact on student success.

Abstract: Tutoring dialogues have gained significant attention in recent years, given
the prominence of online learning and the emerging tutoring abilities of
artificial intelligence (AI) agents powered by large language models (LLMs).
Recent studies have shown that the strategies used by tutors can have
significant effects on student outcomes, necessitating methods to predict how
tutors will behave and how their actions impact students. However, few works
have studied predicting tutor strategy in dialogues. Therefore, in this work we
investigate the ability of modern LLMs, particularly Llama 3 and GPT-4o, to
predict both future tutor moves and student outcomes in dialogues, using two
math tutoring dialogue datasets. We find that even state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to predict future tutor strategy while tutor strategy is highly
indicative of student outcomes, outlining a need for more powerful methods to
approach this task.

*Zihan Ma,Taolin Zhang,Maosong Cao,Wenwei Zhang,Minnan Luo,Songyang Zhang,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in current code-generation benchmarks for LLMs by proposing a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA) and a new benchmark (TCGBench) to improve test-case quality and coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks for LLMs in code-generation tasks are limited by homogeneous test cases, leading to undetected faults and inflated performance metrics. This undermines accurate reward estimation in RLVR frameworks.

Method: The authors introduce SAGA, a human-LLM collaborative approach, and TCGBench, a new benchmark. They also propose multi-dimensional metrics to evaluate test-suite thoroughness.

Result: SAGA achieves a 90.62% detection rate and 32.58% verifier accuracy on TCGBench, outperforming LiveCodeBench-v6 by 10.78% in verifier accuracy.

Conclusion: The work aims to enhance LLM code evaluation reliability, advance RLVR in code generation, and enable automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in
code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a
detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a
limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going
undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also
compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks
utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we
systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing
multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite
thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method
(SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability,
aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated
test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the
TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a
verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc)
of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78%
higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building
a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR
in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis
and adaptive benchmark integration.

TL;DR: The paper examines the sensitivity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to query perturbations, revealing significant performance degradation under minor variations. It proposes an evaluation framework and practical recommendations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models (LLMs) are costly to update, and RAG offers a dynamic solution but is highly sensitive to query quality.

Method: Analysis of RAG pipeline components under query perturbations, isolation of modules, and end-to-end evaluation using diverse datasets.

Result: Performance of retrievers degrades notably with minor query variations; over 1092 experiments inform findings.

Conclusion: Proposes an evaluation framework for RAG robustness and actionable recommendations for practitioners.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are very costly and inefficient to update with
new information. To address this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) has been proposed as a solution that dynamically incorporates external
knowledge during inference, improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations. Despite its promise, RAG systems face practical challenges-most
notably, a strong dependence on the quality of the input query for accurate
retrieval. In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different
components in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that the performance of commonly used retrievers can degrade
significantly even under minor query variations. We study each module in
isolation as well as their combined effect in an end-to-end question answering
setting, using both general-domain and domain-specific datasets. Additionally,
we propose an evaluation framework to systematically assess the query-level
robustness of RAG pipelines and offer actionable recommendations for
practitioners based on the results of more than 1092 experiments we performed.

TL;DR: FlexOlmo is a language model supporting distributed training without data sharing and flexible inference, using a MoE architecture. It improves performance by 41% and outperforms prior methods by 10.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of training models on closed datasets without data sharing while respecting data owners' preferences and licensing requirements.

Method: Uses a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with independently trained experts on closed datasets, integrated via domain-informed routing. Trained on FlexMix, a curated corpus with public and domain-specific datasets.

Result: Achieves a 41% relative improvement by combining general and domain-specific experts, outperforms prior merging methods by 10.1%, and matches standard MoE performance.

Conclusion: FlexOlmo offers a solution for regulated industries, enabling benefits from closed data while respecting data ownership and access control.

Abstract: We introduce FlexOlmo, a new class of language models (LMs) that supports (1)
distributed training without data sharing, where different model parameters are
independently trained on closed datasets, and (2) data-flexible inference,
where these parameters along with their associated data can be flexibly
included or excluded from model inferences with no further training. FlexOlmo
employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture where each expert is trained
independently on closed datasets and later integrated through a new
domain-informed routing without any joint training. FlexOlmo is trained on
FlexMix, a corpus we curate comprising publicly available datasets alongside
seven domain-specific sets, representing realistic approximations of closed
sets. We evaluate models with up to 37 billion parameters (20 billion active)
on 31 diverse downstream tasks. We show that a general expert trained on public
data can be effectively combined with independently trained experts from other
data owners, leading to an average 41% relative improvement while allowing
users to opt out of certain data based on data licensing or permission
requirements. Our approach also outperforms prior model merging methods by
10.1% on average and surpasses the standard MoE trained without data
restrictions using the same training FLOPs. Altogether, this research presents
a solution for both data owners and researchers in regulated industries with
sensitive or protected data. FlexOlmo enables benefiting from closed data while
respecting data owners' preferences by keeping their data local and supporting
fine-grained control of data access during inference.

TL;DR: A unified model for conversational search combines dense retrieval and response generation, outperforming existing baselines by jointly fine-tuning and addressing inconsistency risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing conversational search systems use separate models, limiting effectiveness. A unified approach could leverage intrinsic knowledge better.

Method: Joint fine-tuning of dense retrieval and response generation with mechanisms to reduce inconsistency and data discrepancy.

Result: Evaluations on five datasets show mutual improvement in both tasks and superior performance over baselines.

Conclusion: The unified model effectively combines retrieval and generation, enhancing conversational search systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of conversational search systems revolutionizes how
information is accessed by enabling the multi-turn interaction between the user
and the system. Existing conversational search systems are usually built with
two different models. This separation restricts the system from leveraging the
intrinsic knowledge of the models simultaneously, which cannot ensure the
effectiveness of retrieval benefiting the generation. The existing studies for
developing unified models cannot fully address the aspects of understanding
conversational context, managing retrieval independently, and generating
responses. In this paper, we explore how to unify dense retrieval and response
generation for large language models in conversation. We conduct joint
fine-tuning with different objectives and design two mechanisms to reduce the
inconsistency risks while mitigating data discrepancy. The evaluations on five
conversational search datasets demonstrate that our unified model can mutually
improve both tasks and outperform the existing baselines.

*Ashen Weligalle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores discrete diffusion models (D3PM) for natural language generation, comparing them to autoregressive models. D3PM shows faster processing but lower compression efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models excel in continuous data but struggle with discrete data like language due to token dependencies. This work investigates their feasibility for natural language generation.

Method: Evaluates D3PM against autoregressive models using metrics like BPT, NLL, PPL, and batch speed. Tests involve generating 100,000 tokens per model.

Result: D3PM achieves higher processing speed (3.97 batches/sec) but lower compression (mean BPT 8.05) compared to AR models (mean BPT 4.59).

Conclusion: D3PM shows promise for parallel generation but lags in compression. Highlights trade-offs and supports future non-autoregressive language model research.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of generative models,
achieving state-of-the-art results in continuous data domains such as image and
video generation. Their core mechanism involves a forward diffusion process
that gradually transforms structured data into a Gaussian-like distribution,
followed by a learned reverse process to reconstruct the data. While successful
in continuous modalities, applying this framework to discrete data-particularly
natural language-remains challenging due to token dependency complexities and
the lack of a defined generation order.This thesis investigates the feasibility
and performance of discrete diffusion models for natural language generation.
Specifically, we evaluate the Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
(D3PM) and compare it with traditional autoregressive (AR) language models. To
assess generative performance, we use Bits Per Token (BPT), Negative
Log-Likelihood (NLL), Perplexity (PPL), and Batch Processing Speed.
  Results show the best-performing D3PM model achieves a BPT of 5.72, with a
mean of 8.05. The AR model outperforms in compression with a lower mean BPT of
4.59, but D3PM achieves higher processing speed, reaching up to 3.97 batches
per sec., indicating potential for parallel generation.All evaluations were
conducted under consistent conditions-generating 100,000 tokens per model with
a fixed batch size of four-for fair comparison. This research presents a
detailed analysis of diffusion-based vs. autoregressive models, highlighting
trade-offs in generative quality and efficiency. Findings emphasize both the
promise and limitations of diffusion models for discrete data, supporting
future work in non-autoregressive language generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a UIE method using CLIP perception loss and curriculum contrastive regularization to improve perceptual quality and content restoration in underwater images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning-based UIE methods often ignore human perception and lack constraints, leading to poor perceptual quality or content restoration.

Method: Leverages CLIP for visual semantic feature extraction, integrates it as a perception loss module, and combines it with curriculum contrastive regularization for better constraints.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and generalization.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances underwater images by aligning with human perception and improving constraints.

Abstract: High-quality underwater images are essential for both machine vision tasks
and viewers with their aesthetic appeal.However, the quality of underwater
images is severely affected by light absorption and scattering. Deep
learning-based methods for Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) have achieved
good performance. However, these methods often overlook considering human
perception and lack sufficient constraints within the solution space.
Consequently, the enhanced images often suffer from diminished perceptual
quality or poor content restoration.To address these issues, we propose a UIE
method with a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perception loss
module and curriculum contrastive regularization. Above all, to develop a
perception model for underwater images that more aligns with human visual
perception, the visual semantic feature extraction capability of the CLIP model
is leveraged to learn an appropriate prompt pair to map and evaluate the
quality of underwater images. This CLIP perception model is then incorporated
as a perception loss module into the enhancement network to improve the
perceptual quality of enhanced images. Furthermore, the CLIP perception model
is integrated with the curriculum contrastive regularization to enhance the
constraints imposed on the enhanced images within the CLIP perceptual space,
mitigating the risk of both under-enhancement and over-enhancement.
Specifically, the CLIP perception model is employed to assess and categorize
the learning difficulty level of negatives in the regularization process,
ensuring comprehensive and nuanced utilization of distorted images and
negatives with varied quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and
generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARC introduces a unified latent space for AI models, improving cross-model interpretability with global sparsity and cross-reconstruction loss, achieving high concept alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods produce isolated representations, limiting cross-model interpretability. SPARC aims to create a shared latent space for diverse models.

Method: SPARC uses Global TopK sparsity and Cross-Reconstruction Loss to enforce alignment and semantic consistency across models.

Result: SPARC achieves a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, tripling alignment compared to prior methods, enabling direct comparison of model representations.

Conclusion: SPARC's aligned latent space facilitates cross-model analysis and practical applications like text-guided localization and retrieval.

Abstract: Understanding how different AI models encode the same high-level concepts,
such as objects or attributes, remains challenging because each model typically
produces its own isolated representation. Existing interpretability methods
like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) produce latent concepts individually for each
model, resulting in incompatible concept spaces and limiting cross-model
interpretability. To address this, we introduce SPARC (Sparse Autoencoders for
Aligned Representation of Concepts), a new framework that learns a single,
unified latent space shared across diverse architectures and modalities (e.g.,
vision models like DINO, and multimodal models like CLIP). SPARC's alignment is
enforced through two key innovations: (1) a Global TopK sparsity mechanism,
ensuring all input streams activate identical latent dimensions for a given
concept; and (2) a Cross-Reconstruction Loss, which explicitly encourages
semantic consistency between models. On Open Images, SPARC dramatically
improves concept alignment, achieving a Jaccard similarity of 0.80, more than
tripling the alignment compared to previous methods. SPARC creates a shared
sparse latent space where individual dimensions often correspond to similar
high-level concepts across models and modalities, enabling direct comparison of
how different architectures represent identical concepts without requiring
manual alignment or model-specific analysis. As a consequence of this aligned
representation, SPARC also enables practical applications such as text-guided
spatial localization in vision-only models and cross-model/cross-modal
retrieval. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: BayesSDF is a probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in neural implicit SDF models, addressing challenges like computational inefficiency and geometric inconsistencies. It outperforms existing methods in calibration and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for precise surface geometry and uncertainty awareness in scientific simulations (e.g., fluid flow through forests) motivates the development of BayesSDF.

Method: BayesSDF uses a Laplace approximation with Hessian-based metrics for efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation in SDF models.

Result: The method provides well-calibrated uncertainty maps, closely matching poorly reconstructed geometry, and outperforms existing techniques in evaluations.

Conclusion: BayesSDF establishes a robust foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D reconstruction, simulation, and robotic applications.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in neural implicit 3D representations, particularly
those utilizing Signed Distance Functions (SDFs), remains a substantial
challenge due to computational inefficiencies, scalability issues, and
geometric inconsistencies. Existing methods typically neglect direct geometric
integration, leading to poorly calibrated uncertainty maps. We introduce
BayesSDF, a novel probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification in
neural implicit SDF models, motivated by scientific simulation applications
with 3D environments (e.g., forests) such as modeling fluid flow through
forests, where precise surface geometry and awareness of fidelity surface
geometric uncertainty are essential. Unlike radiance-based models such as NeRF
or 3D Gaussian splatting, which lack explicit surface formulations, SDFs define
continuous and differentiable geometry, making them better suited for physical
modeling and analysis. BayesSDF leverages a Laplace approximation to quantify
local surface instability via Hessian-based metrics, enabling computationally
efficient, surface-aware uncertainty estimation. Our method shows that
uncertainty predictions correspond closely with poorly reconstructed geometry,
providing actionable confidence measures for downstream use. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that BayesSDF
outperforms existing methods in both calibration and geometric consistency,
establishing a strong foundation for uncertainty-aware 3D scene reconstruction,
simulation, and robotic decision-making.

TL;DR: LIRA addresses inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension in LMMs by combining semantic and pixel-level features (SEFE) and fine-grained supervision (ILVC), achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) struggle with inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension due to weak visual comprehension and lack of fine-grained perception.

Method: LIRA uses SEFE for semantic-pixel fusion and ILVC for fine-grained supervision via local descriptions. The AttrEval dataset quantifies segmentation-semantics correlation.

Result: LIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance in segmentation and comprehension tasks.

Conclusion: LIRA effectively mitigates limitations in LMMs by leveraging semantic and fine-grained supervision, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: While large multi-modal models (LMMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in
segmentation and comprehension, they still struggle with two limitations:
inaccurate segmentation and hallucinated comprehension. These challenges stem
primarily from constraints in weak visual comprehension and a lack of
fine-grained perception. To alleviate these limitations, we propose LIRA, a
framework that capitalizes on the complementary relationship between visual
comprehension and segmentation via two key components: (1) Semantic-Enhanced
Feature Extractor (SEFE) improves object attribute inference by fusing semantic
and pixel-level features, leading to more accurate segmentation; (2)
Interleaved Local Visual Coupling (ILVC) autoregressively generates local
descriptions after extracting local features based on segmentation masks,
offering fine-grained supervision to mitigate hallucinations. Furthermore, we
find that the precision of object segmentation is positively correlated with
the latent related semantics of the <seg> token. To quantify this relationship
and the model's potential semantic inferring ability, we introduce the
Attributes Evaluation (AttrEval) dataset. Our experiments show that LIRA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in both segmentation and comprehension
tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/echo840/LIRA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated training data for HTR systems, especially for low-resource languages and complex scripts, hinders performance.

Method: Systematic review using PRISMA methodology, analyzing 1,302 studies (filtered to 848) from major academic sources.

Result: Identifies gaps in generating diverse, realistic handwriting samples and preserving script authenticity.

Conclusion: Proposes future directions to advance handwritten text generation for diverse linguistic and stylistic needs.

Abstract: Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems play a crucial role in
applications such as historical document digitization, automatic form
processing, and biometric authentication. However, their performance is often
hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data, particularly
for low-resource languages and complex scripts. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of offline handwritten data augmentation and generation
techniques designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of HTR systems. We
systematically examine traditional augmentation methods alongside recent
advances in deep learning, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
diffusion models, and transformer-based approaches. Furthermore, we explore the
challenges associated with generating diverse and realistic handwriting
samples, particularly in preserving script authenticity and addressing data
scarcity. This survey follows the PRISMA methodology, ensuring a structured and
rigorous selection process. Our analysis began with 1,302 primary studies,
which were filtered down to 848 after removing duplicates, drawing from key
academic sources such as IEEE Digital Library, Springer Link, Science Direct,
and ACM Digital Library. By evaluating existing datasets, assessment metrics,
and state-of-the-art methodologies, this survey identifies key research gaps
and proposes future directions to advance the field of handwritten text
generation across diverse linguistic and stylistic landscapes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCPDA, a data augmentation method to improve fire-class segmentation in wildland fire science by copying and refining fire clusters from source to target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the scarcity of labeled datasets for training segmentation models in wildland fire science, especially for the fire class.

Method: CCPDA involves identifying fire clusters, centralizing them to focus on core areas, and pasting onto target images to enhance dataset diversity.

Result: CCPDA outperforms other augmentation methods, improving fire-class segmentation metrics significantly.

Conclusion: CCPDA effectively mitigates challenges of small labeled datasets and enhances fire-class segmentation performance.

Abstract: Collecting and annotating images for the purpose of training segmentation
models is often cost prohibitive. In the domain of wildland fire science, this
challenge is further compounded by the scarcity of reliable public datasets
with labeled ground truth. This paper presents the Centralized Copy-Paste Data
Augmentation (CCPDA) method, for the purpose of assisting with the training of
deep-learning multiclass segmentation models, with special focus on improving
segmentation outcomes for the fire-class. CCPDA has three main steps: (i)
identify fire clusters in the source image, (ii) apply a centralization
technique to focus on the core of the fire area, and (iii) paste the refined
fire clusters onto a target image. This method increases dataset diversity
while preserving the essential characteristics of the fire class. The
effectiveness of this augmentation technique is demonstrated via numerical
analysis and comparison against various other augmentation methods using a
weighted sum-based multi-objective optimization approach. This approach helps
elevate segmentation performance metrics specific to the fire class, which
carries significantly more operational significance than other classes (fuel,
ash, or background). Numerical performance assessment validates the efficacy of
the presented CCPDA method in alleviating the difficulties associated with
small, manually labeled training datasets. It also illustrates that CCPDA
outperforms other augmentation strategies in the application scenario
considered, particularly in improving fire-class segmentation performance.

*Fuyuan Zhang,Qichen Wang,Jianjun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness) improves CNN robustness to common corruptions by aligning class activation maps (CAMs) between clean and corrupted images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks degrade in performance under common corruptions, limiting real-world reliability.

Method: AR2 aligns CAMs between clean and corrupted images iteratively, combining CAM-guided refinement and fine-tuning without architectural changes.

Result: AR2 outperforms state-of-the-art methods on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C, balancing clean data accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: AR2 offers a scalable solution to enhance model reliability in real-world environments with corruptions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks suffer from significant performance degradation when
exposed to common corruptions such as noise, blur, weather, and digital
distortions, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. In this
paper, we propose AR2 (Attention-Guided Repair for Robustness), a simple yet
effective method to enhance the corruption robustness of pretrained CNNs. AR2
operates by explicitly aligning the class activation maps (CAMs) between clean
and corrupted images, encouraging the model to maintain consistent attention
even under input perturbations. Our approach follows an iterative repair
strategy that alternates between CAM-guided refinement and standard
fine-tuning, without requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments
show that AR2 consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
restoring robustness on standard corruption benchmarks (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C
and ImageNet-C), achieving a favorable balance between accuracy on clean data
and corruption robustness. These results demonstrate that AR2 provides a robust
and scalable solution for enhancing model reliability in real-world
environments with diverse corruptions.

Motivation: Bio-impedance sensing is underutilized due to lack of labeled data; SImpHAR aims to overcome this limitation.

Method: Uses a simulation pipeline with 3D human meshes and a two-stage training strategy for broader activity coverage.

Result: Achieves up to 22.3% and 21.8% improvements in accuracy and macro F1 score.

Conclusion: Simulation-driven augmentation and modular training show promise for impedance-based HAR.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable sensors is essential for
applications in healthcare, fitness, and human-computer interaction.
Bio-impedance sensing offers unique advantages for fine-grained motion capture
but remains underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. We introduce
SImpHAR, a novel framework addressing this limitation through two core
contributions. First, we propose a simulation pipeline that generates realistic
bio-impedance signals from 3D human meshes using shortest-path estimation,
soft-body physics, and text-to-motion generation serving as a digital twin for
data augmentation. Second, we design a two-stage training strategy with
decoupled approach that enables broader activity coverage without requiring
label-aligned synthetic data. We evaluate SImpHAR on our collected ImpAct
dataset and two public benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, with gains of up to 22.3% and 21.8%, in terms of
accuracy and macro F1 score, respectively. Our results highlight the promise of
simulation-driven augmentation and modular training for impedance-based HAR.

TL;DR: PCL-Former, a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture, improves temporal action localization by using dedicated transformer modules for proposal, classification, and localization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leveraging transformers and multi-stage architectures for video recognition and object detection, the paper aims to enhance temporal action localization (TAL) by exploring spatio-temporal properties.

Method: Develops PCL-Former with three transformer modules: Proposal-Former for segment identification, Classification-Former for action categorization, and Localization-Former for boundary prediction. Specialized loss functions are used for each module.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art TAL methods by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: PCL-Former is effective for TAL, validated by superior performance on benchmark datasets and detailed ablation studies.

Abstract: Inspired by the recent success of transformers and multi-stage architectures
in video recognition and object detection domains. We thoroughly explore the
rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage
architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This
exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer
architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated
transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the
Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may
contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories
within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the
temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate
the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three
challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments.
We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each
individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate
the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art
TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS
datasets, respectively.

*Soroush Shahi,Farzad Shahabi,Rama Nabulsi,Glenn Fernandes,Aggelos Katsaggelos,Nabil Alshurafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THOR is a real-time adaptive RGB frame sampling method using thermal sensing to efficiently capture and classify hand-object interactions, reducing data volume and power consumption while maintaining high recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous RGB image processing in wearable cameras is power-intensive, generates excessive data, raises privacy concerns, and demands high computational resources. THOR addresses these issues by leveraging thermal sensing.

Method: THOR uses low-resolution thermal data to detect hand-activity transitions, adjusting RGB frame sampling rates accordingly. It localizes hand-object interactions in RGB frames using thermal cues, cropping only relevant regions for processing.

Result: The method captures all activity segments using only 3% of original RGB data, achieving a 95% F1-score for hand-related activity recognition, comparable to full RGB video (94%).

Conclusion: THOR offers a practical solution for real-time, longitudinal monitoring of hand-related activities and health-risk behaviors with wearable cameras.

Abstract: Wearable cameras are increasingly used as an observational and interventional
tool for human behaviors by providing detailed visual data of hand-related
activities. This data can be leveraged to facilitate memory recall for logging
of behavior or timely interventions aimed at improving health. However,
continuous processing of RGB images from these cameras consumes significant
power impacting battery lifetime, generates a large volume of unnecessary video
data for post-processing, raises privacy concerns, and requires substantial
computational resources for real-time analysis. We introduce THOR, a real-time
adaptive spatio-temporal RGB frame sampling method that leverages thermal
sensing to capture hand-object patches and classify them in real-time. We use
low-resolution thermal camera data to identify moments when a person switches
from one hand-related activity to another, and adjust the RGB frame sampling
rate by increasing it during activity transitions and reducing it during
periods of sustained activity. Additionally, we use the thermal cues from the
hand to localize the region of interest (i.e., the hand-object interaction) in
each RGB frame, allowing the system to crop and process only the necessary part
of the image for activity recognition. We develop a wearable device to validate
our method through an in-the-wild study with 14 participants and over 30
activities, and further evaluate it on Ego4D (923 participants across 9
countries, totaling 3,670 hours of video). Our results show that using only 3%
of the original RGB video data, our method captures all the activity segments,
and achieves hand-related activity recognition F1-score (95%) comparable to
using the entire RGB video (94%). Our work provides a more practical path for
the longitudinal use of wearable cameras to monitor hand-related activities and
health-risk behaviors in real time.

TL;DR: Proposes an event autoencoder for efficient event data compression and reconstruction, achieving high-speed, low-power object detection with comparable accuracy to YOLO-v4.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional frame-based vision systems have limitations like motion blur and high latency, while event cameras face challenges in object detection due to sparse, noisy data.

Method: Uses an event autoencoder with convolutional encoding, adaptive threshold selection, and a lightweight classifier to enhance accuracy and reduce complexity.

Result: Achieves comparable accuracy to YOLO-v4 with 35.5x fewer parameters, and runs at 8-44.8 FPS on embedded platforms, outperforming state-of-the-art by 87.84x in FPS.

Conclusion: The model significantly improves event-based vision performance, making it suitable for real-time, low-power edge computing applications.

Abstract: High-speed vision sensing is essential for real-time perception in
applications such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation.
Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency,
and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic
environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at
the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object
detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an
event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs
event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The
proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive
threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition
accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the
existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves
comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$
fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi
4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8
FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the
state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance,
making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge
computing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-RTS improves video reasoning efficiency by combining data-efficient RL and adaptive test-time scaling, outperforming existing models with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high cost and scalability issues of traditional RL-based video reasoning methods that rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning and annotations.

Method: Skip supervised fine-tuning; use pure-RL training with output-based rewards and introduce a sparse-to-dense video test-time scaling strategy for efficient inference.

Result: Achieves 2.4% higher accuracy on average using only 3.6% of training samples, with notable improvements on benchmarks like Video-Holmes (4.2%) and MMVU (2.6%).

Conclusion: Video-RTS demonstrates strong reasoning performance by leveraging pure RL training and adaptive video scaling, offering a scalable and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

Abstract: Despite advances in reinforcement learning (RL)-based video reasoning with
large language models (LLMs), data collection and finetuning remain significant
challenges. These methods often rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with extensive video data and long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations,
making them costly and hard to scale. To address this, we present Video-RTS, a
new approach to improve video reasoning capability with drastically improved
data efficiency by combining data-efficient RL with a video-adaptive test-time
scaling (TTS) strategy. Based on observations about the data scaling of RL
samples, we skip the resource-intensive SFT step and employ efficient pure-RL
training with output-based rewards, requiring no additional annotations or
extensive fine-tuning. Furthermore, to utilize computational resources more
efficiently, we introduce a sparse-to-dense video TTS strategy that improves
inference by iteratively adding frames based on output consistency. We validate
our approach on multiple video reasoning benchmarks, showing that Video-RTS
surpasses existing video reasoning models by an average of 2.4% in accuracy
using only 3.6% training samples. For example, Video-RTS achieves a 4.2%
improvement on Video-Holmes, a recent and challenging video reasoning
benchmark, and a 2.6% improvement on MMVU. Notably, our pure RL training and
adaptive video TTS offer complementary strengths, enabling Video-RTS's strong
reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mask6D, a novel pre-training strategy for 6D pose estimation, uses pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence and visible mask maps to improve feature extraction in cluttered or occluded scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose estimation networks struggle with discriminative feature extraction in occluded or cluttered scenes due to limited RGB information.

Method: Proposes Mask6D, incorporating 2D-3D correspondence and visible mask maps for pre-training, along with an object-focused loss function. Fine-tuning follows conventional pose training.

Result: Outperforms previous end-to-end pose estimation methods in experiments.

Conclusion: Mask6D effectively enhances pose estimation in challenging conditions by leveraging additional modal information and focused pre-training.

Abstract: Robust 6D object pose estimation in cluttered or occluded conditions using
monocular RGB images remains a challenging task. One reason is that current
pose estimation networks struggle to extract discriminative, pose-aware
features using 2D feature backbones, especially when the available RGB
information is limited due to target occlusion in cluttered scenes. To mitigate
this, we propose a novel pose estimation-specific pre-training strategy named
Mask6D. Our approach incorporates pose-aware 2D-3D correspondence maps and
visible mask maps as additional modal information, which is combined with RGB
images for the reconstruction-based model pre-training. Essentially, this 2D-3D
correspondence maps a transformed 3D object model to 2D pixels, reflecting the
pose information of the target in camera coordinate system. Meanwhile, the
integrated visible mask map can effectively guide our model to disregard
cluttered background information. In addition, an object-focused pre-training
loss function is designed to further facilitate our network to remove the
background interference. Finally, we fine-tune our pre-trained pose prior-aware
network via conventional pose training strategy to realize the reliable pose
prediction. Extensive experiments verify that our method outperforms previous
end-to-end pose estimation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Bilateral Collaboration framework (BC-HOI) is proposed for open vocabulary HOI detection, addressing coarse-grained VLM features with fine-grained instance-level and token-level guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods rely on coarse-grained VLM features, which are unsuitable for fine-grained detection tasks.

Method: BC-HOI includes Attention Bias Guidance (ABG) for fine-grained VLM features and LLM-based Supervision Guidance (LSG) for token-level supervision.

Result: Superior performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks in both open and closed settings.

Conclusion: BC-HOI effectively improves HOI detection by refining VLM features and leveraging LLM supervision.

Abstract: Open vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging
task that detects all <human, verb, object> triplets of interest in an image,
even those that are not pre-defined in the training set. Existing approaches
typically rely on output features generated by large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to enhance the generalization ability of interaction representations.
However, the visual features produced by VLMs are holistic and coarse-grained,
which contradicts the nature of detection tasks. To address this issue, we
propose a novel Bilateral Collaboration framework for open vocabulary HOI
detection (BC-HOI). This framework includes an Attention Bias Guidance (ABG)
component, which guides the VLM to produce fine-grained instance-level
interaction features according to the attention bias provided by the HOI
detector. It also includes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Supervision
Guidance (LSG) component, which provides fine-grained token-level supervision
for the HOI detector by the LLM component of the VLM. LSG enhances the ability
of ABG to generate high-quality attention bias. We conduct extensive
experiments on two popular benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO, consistently
achieving superior performance in the open vocabulary and closed settings. The
code will be released in Github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIFA is a unified framework for evaluating faithfulness in VideoMLLMs, addressing hallucinations in open-ended tasks via descriptive facts, semantic dependency graphs, and VideoQA models. Post-Correction further improves factual consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoMLLMs suffer from hallucinations, and existing evaluation methods are limited to specific tasks or fail to assess open-ended responses.

Method: FIFA extracts descriptive facts, models semantic dependencies with a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using VideoQA models. Post-Correction revises hallucinated content.

Result: FIFA aligns better with human judgment than existing methods, and Post-Correction enhances factual consistency in text and video generation.

Conclusion: FIFA and Post-Correction provide effective solutions for evaluating and improving faithfulness in VideoMLLMs.

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models (VideoMLLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in both Video-to-Text and Text-to-Video tasks. However, they often
suffer fro hallucinations, generating content that contradicts the visual
input. Existing evaluation methods are limited to one task (e.g., V2T) and also
fail to assess hallucinations in open-ended, free-form responses. To address
this gap, we propose FIFA, a unified FaIthFulness evAluation framework that
extracts comprehensive descriptive facts, models their semantic dependencies
via a Spatio-Temporal Semantic Dependency Graph, and verifies them using
VideoQA models. We further introduce Post-Correction, a tool-based correction
framework that revises hallucinated content. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that FIFA aligns more closely with human judgment than existing evaluation
methods, and that Post-Correction effectively improves factual consistency in
both text and video generation.

*Chaoshuo Zhang,Chenhao Lin,Zhengyu Zhao,Le Yang,Qian Wang,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU), a method to balance unlearning effectiveness and generative retainability in text-to-image diffusion models by targeting pivotal steps in the generation process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the misuse of text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and the limitations of existing unlearning methods in balancing effectiveness and retainability.

Method: KSCU focuses on key steps in the diffusion model's sampling process, fine-tuning only at these steps to reduce parameter updates and preserve generative capabilities.

Result: KSCU effectively prevents undesirable image generation while better retaining the model's generative performance, as shown in benchmark experiments.

Conclusion: KSCU offers a targeted and efficient solution for concept unlearning in diffusion models, improving both security and usability.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion,
which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely
used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing
concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to
balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this
limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU)
method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling
characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation
process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally,
KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the
final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and
fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the
number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing
the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive
benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs
from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's
generative capabilities.Our code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A pipeline converts English speech into 3D sign language animations using speech-to-text, gloss translation, and motion generation, achieving high BLEU scores and natural animations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked task of converting spoken English into sign language animations, which involves complex steps like speech understanding, translation, and motion generation.

Method: Uses Whisper for speech-to-text, MarianMT for gloss translation (with Word2Vec/FastText embeddings), and a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on Sign3D-WLASL. Introduces BookGlossCorpus-CG for gloss translation support.

Result: Achieves BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923 for gloss translation and generates smooth, realistic 3D animations.

Conclusion: The pipeline integrates audio, text, and motion into a unified framework, advancing the field of sign language translation.

Abstract: Helping deaf and hard-of-hearing people communicate more easily is the main
goal of Automatic Sign Language Translation. Although most past research has
focused on turning sign language into text, doing the reverse, turning spoken
English into sign language animations, has been largely overlooked. That's
because it involves multiple steps, such as understanding speech, translating
it into sign-friendly grammar, and generating natural human motion. In this
work, we introduce a complete pipeline that converts English speech into
smooth, realistic 3D sign language animations. Our system starts with Whisper
to translate spoken English into text. Then, we use a MarianMT machine
translation model to translate that text into American Sign Language (ASL)
gloss, a simplified version of sign language that captures meaning without
grammar. This model performs well, reaching BLEU scores of 0.7714 and 0.8923.
To make the gloss translation more accurate, we also use word embeddings such
as Word2Vec and FastText to understand word meanings. Finally, we animate the
translated gloss using a 3D keypoint-based motion system trained on
Sign3D-WLASL, a dataset we created by extracting body, hand, and face key
points from real ASL videos in the WLASL dataset. To support the gloss
translation stage, we also built a new dataset called BookGlossCorpus-CG, which
turns everyday English sentences from the BookCorpus dataset into ASL gloss
using grammar rules. Our system stitches everything together by smoothly
interpolating between signs to create natural, continuous animations. Unlike
previous works like How2Sign and Phoenix-2014T that focus on recognition or use
only one type of data, our pipeline brings together audio, text, and motion in
a single framework that goes all the way from spoken English to lifelike 3D
sign language animation.

*Mingjin Zeng,Nan Ouyang,Wenkang Wan,Lei Ao,Qing Cai,Kai Sheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ILNet introduces Inverse Learning attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection for multi-agent trajectory prediction, improving accuracy and adaptability in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human drivers dynamically adjust decisions based on surrounding intentions, inspiring the need for better spatio-temporal interaction modeling in trajectory prediction.

Method: ILNet uses Inverse Learning attention for dynamic spatio-temporal coordination and a Dynamic Anchor Selection module for adaptable trajectory refinement.

Result: ILNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on INTERACTION and Argoverse datasets, excelling in complex interactions with fewer parameters.

Conclusion: ILNet enhances trajectory prediction by mimicking human-like adaptability and interaction modeling, validated by superior performance.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction for multi-agent interaction scenarios is a crucial
challenge. Most advanced methods model agent interactions by efficiently
factorized attention based on the temporal and agent axes. However, this static
and foward modeling lacks explicit interactive spatio-temporal coordination,
capturing only obvious and immediate behavioral intentions. Alternatively, the
modern trajectory prediction framework refines the successive predictions by a
fixed-anchor selection strategy, which is difficult to adapt in different
future environments. It is acknowledged that human drivers dynamically adjust
initial driving decisions based on further assumptions about the intentions of
surrounding vehicles. Motivated by human driving behaviors, this paper proposes
ILNet, a multi-agent trajectory prediction method with Inverse Learning (IL)
attention and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS) module. IL Attention employs an
inverse learning paradigm to model interactions at neighboring moments,
introducing proposed intentions to dynamically encode the spatio-temporal
coordination of interactions, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture
complex interaction patterns. Then, the learnable DAS module is proposed to
extract multiple trajectory change keypoints as anchors in parallel with almost
no increase in parameters. Experimental results show that the ILNet achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the INTERACTION and Argoverse motion
forecasting datasets. Particularly, in challenged interaction scenarios, ILNet
achieves higher accuracy and more multimodal distributions of trajectories over
fewer parameters. Our codes are available at https://github.com/mjZeng11/ILNet.

*Thi Thu Thuy Nguyen,Duc Thanh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic active learning approach for wildlife detection in camera trap data, reducing labeling effort while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildlife data from camera traps is voluminous and costly to label, requiring efficient methods to reduce labeling effort without compromising detection accuracy.

Method: Proposes an active learning approach integrating uncertainty and diversity at object and image levels for sample selection, validated on a benchmark animal dataset.

Result: Using only 30% of training data selected by the approach, a state-of-the-art animal detector matches or exceeds performance of using the full dataset.

Conclusion: The model-agnostic active learning method effectively reduces labeling effort for wildlife detection, enabling more efficient automated monitoring and conservation.

Abstract: Smart data selection is becoming increasingly important in data-driven
machine learning. Active learning offers a promising solution by allowing
machine learning models to be effectively trained with optimal data including
the most informative samples from large datasets. Wildlife data captured by
camera traps are excessive in volume, requiring tremendous effort in data
labelling and animal detection models training. Therefore, applying active
learning to optimise the amount of labelled data would be a great aid in
enabling automated wildlife monitoring and conservation. However, existing
active learning techniques require that a machine learning model (i.e., an
object detector) be fully accessible, limiting the applicability of the
techniques. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic active learning approach
for detection of animals captured by camera traps. Our approach integrates
uncertainty and diversity quantities of samples at both the object-based and
image-based levels into the active learning sample selection process. We
validate our approach in a benchmark animal dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that, using only 30% of the training data selected by our approach,
a state-of-the-art animal detector can achieve a performance of equal or
greater than that with the use of the complete training dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToBo is a self-supervised learning pipeline that compresses scenes into bottleneck tokens and predicts future scenes using minimal hints, excelling in sequential tasks like video tracking and robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for compact and temporally aware visual representations in dynamic scenes for tasks like visual tracking and robotic manipulation.

Method: ToBo uses a squeeze step to encode scenes into bottleneck tokens and an expansion step to predict future scenes with minimal hints, embedding temporal dependencies.

Result: ToBo outperforms baselines in tasks like video label propagation and robot manipulation, proving robust in real-world and scalable across model sizes.

Conclusion: ToBo effectively learns sequential scene representations, demonstrating superior performance and scalability in dynamic scene understanding tasks.

Abstract: Deriving compact and temporally aware visual representations from dynamic
scenes is essential for successful execution of sequential scene understanding
tasks such as visual tracking and robotic manipulation. In this paper, we
introduce Token Bottleneck (ToBo), a simple yet intuitive self-supervised
learning pipeline that squeezes a scene into a bottleneck token and predicts
the subsequent scene using minimal patches as hints. The ToBo pipeline
facilitates the learning of sequential scene representations by conservatively
encoding the reference scene into a compact bottleneck token during the squeeze
step. In the expansion step, we guide the model to capture temporal dynamics by
predicting the target scene using the bottleneck token along with few target
patches as hints. This design encourages the vision backbone to embed temporal
dependencies, thereby enabling understanding of dynamic transitions across
scenes. Extensive experiments in diverse sequential tasks, including video
label propagation and robot manipulation in simulated environments demonstrate
the superiority of ToBo over baselines. Moreover, deploying our pre-trained
model on physical robots confirms its robustness and effectiveness in
real-world environments. We further validate the scalability of ToBo across
different model scales.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept-TRAK, a method for concept-level attribution in diffusion models, addressing copyright and transparency concerns by isolating contributions to specific image elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing adoption of diffusion models raises copyright and transparency issues, with existing methods failing to attribute influences to specific image elements like styles or objects.

Method: Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with a reformulated diffusion training loss and a concept-aware reward function for robust, sample-specific attribution.

Result: Concept-TRAK outperforms prior methods on the AbC benchmark and provides actionable insights for responsible AI development through case studies.

Conclusion: Concept-level attribution via Concept-TRAK enhances transparency and governance in generative AI, addressing key stakeholder concerns.

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at image generation, their growing adoption
raises critical concerns around copyright issues and model transparency.
Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire
image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as
styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we
introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called
\emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key
innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion
posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a
concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate
Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior
methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected
and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional
learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable
insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.

*Jae Hyoung Jeon,Cheolsu Lim,Myungjoo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a divergence-based similarity function (DSF) for contrastive learning, capturing joint structure across multiple views, improving performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods in contrastive learning fail to model the joint structure across all augmented views, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Introduces DSF, representing sets of augmented views as distributions and measuring similarity via divergence between distributions.

Result: DSF improves performance in tasks like kNN classification and linear evaluation, and is more efficient than other multi-view methods.

Conclusion: DSF effectively captures joint structure, operates without a temperature hyperparameter, and outperforms cosine similarity.

Abstract: Recent success in contrastive learning has sparked growing interest in more
effectively leveraging multiple augmented views of an instance. While prior
methods incorporate multiple views at the loss or feature level, they primarily
capture pairwise relationships and fail to model the joint structure across all
views. In this work, we propose a divergence-based similarity function (DSF)
that explicitly captures the joint structure by representing each set of
augmented views as a distribution and measuring similarity as the divergence
between distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSF consistently
improves performance across various tasks, including kNN classification and
linear evaluation, while also offering greater efficiency compared to other
multi-view methods. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between
DSF and cosine similarity, and show that, unlike cosine similarity, DSF
operates effectively without requiring a temperature hyperparameter.

### [69] [Edge-Boundary-Texture Loss: A Tri-Class Generalization of Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy for Enhanced Edge Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06569)
*Hao Shu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective for edge detection that categorizes pixels into edge, boundary, and texture, improving precision and contextual localization over the traditional WBCE loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current edge detection methods, using WBCE loss, treat non-edge pixels uniformly, leading to blurred predictions and overlooking structural nuances near edges.

Method: The proposed EBT loss divides pixels into three categories (edge, boundary, texture) with distinct weights, enabling structured learning and better edge localization.

Result: Experiments show EBT loss outperforms WBCE quantitatively and perceptually, with minimal fine-tuning required due to robust hyperparameters.

Conclusion: The EBT loss is a superior, easily deployable alternative to WBCE for edge detection, offering improved precision and contextual awareness.

Abstract: Edge detection (ED) remains a fundamental task in computer vision, yet its
performance is often hindered by the ambiguous nature of non-edge pixels near
object boundaries. The widely adopted Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss
treats all non-edge pixels uniformly, overlooking the structural nuances around
edges and often resulting in blurred predictions. In this paper, we propose the
Edge-Boundary-Texture (EBT) loss, a novel objective that explicitly divides
pixels into three categories, edge, boundary, and texture, and assigns each a
distinct supervisory weight. This tri-class formulation enables more structured
learning by guiding the model to focus on both edge precision and contextual
boundary localization. We theoretically show that the EBT loss generalizes the
WBCE loss, with the latter becoming a limit case. Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the EBT loss both
quantitatively and perceptually. Furthermore, the consistent use of unified
hyperparameters across all models and datasets, along with robustness to their
moderate variations, indicates that the EBT loss requires minimal fine-tuning
and is easily deployable in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOST introduces a motion diffusion model using temporal clip Banzhaf interaction to improve text-to-motion generation, especially for rare prompts, by addressing redundancy and enhancing fine-grained matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with coarse-grained matching and overlook semantic cues due to motion redundancy, particularly for rare language prompts.

Method: MOST uses temporal clip Banzhaf interaction for fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and a motion prompt module for generation.

Result: MOST achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-motion retrieval and generation, especially for rare prompts.

Conclusion: MOST effectively addresses previous challenges in motion generation, offering improved semantic consistency and reduced redundancy.

Abstract: We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf
interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human
motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with
coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion
redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships
to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation
of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies
textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct,
fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy.
In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved
motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive
evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion
retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous
challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results
highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AMContrast3D and AMContrast3D++, adaptive margin contrastive learning methods for 3D semantic segmentation, addressing point ambiguities and improving model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods penalize all points equally, ignoring ambiguities in transition regions, leading to sub-optimal models due to unreliable labels for highly ambiguous points.

Method: Proposes AMContrast3D with adaptive objectives based on ambiguity levels and AMContrast3D++ with a parallel training branch and ambiguity prediction module for masked refinement.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets, improving segmentation performance and robustness.

Conclusion: The adaptive methods enhance model training by handling ambiguities, with AMContrast3D++ further refining embeddings for better reliability.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive margin contrastive learning method for 3D
semantic segmentation on point clouds. Most existing methods use equally
penalized objectives, which ignore the per-point ambiguities and less
discriminated features stemming from transition regions. However, as highly
ambiguous points may be indistinguishable even for humans, their manually
annotated labels are less reliable, and hard constraints over these points
would lead to sub-optimal models. To address this, we first design
AMContrast3D, a method comprising contrastive learning into an ambiguity
estimation framework, tailored to adaptive objectives for individual points
based on ambiguity levels. As a result, our method promotes model training,
which ensures the correctness of low-ambiguity points while allowing mistakes
for high-ambiguity points. As ambiguities are formulated based on position
discrepancies across labels, optimization during inference is constrained by
the assumption that all unlabeled points are uniformly unambiguous, lacking
ambiguity awareness. Inspired by the insight of joint training, we further
propose AMContrast3D++ integrating with two branches trained in parallel, where
a novel ambiguity prediction module concurrently learns point ambiguities from
generated embeddings. To this end, we design a masked refinement mechanism that
leverages predicted ambiguities to enable the ambiguous embeddings to be more
reliable, thereby boosting segmentation performance and enhancing robustness.
Experimental results on 3D indoor scene datasets, S3DIS and ScanNet,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual-camera system (DCS) and exposure-adaptive fusion network (EAFNet) to address flickering in HDR video reconstruction by leveraging consistent reference sequences and selective feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exposure fluctuations in alternating exposure methods cause flickering in HDR video, necessitating a robust solution.

Method: Uses DCS for acquisition (one camera for reference, another for supplementation) and EAFNet for fusion, featuring pre-alignment, asymmetric cross-feature fusion, and DWT-based reconstruction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, reducing ghosting artifacts and flickering.

Conclusion: DCS and EAFNet show great potential for HDR video reconstruction, with codes and data made publicly available.

Abstract: In HDR video reconstruction, exposure fluctuations in reference images from
alternating exposure methods often result in flickering. To address this issue,
we propose a dual-camera system (DCS) for HDR video acquisition, where one
camera is assigned to capture consistent reference sequences, while the other
is assigned to capture non-reference sequences for information supplementation.
To tackle the challenges posed by video data, we introduce an exposure-adaptive
fusion network (EAFNet) to achieve more robust results. EAFNet introduced a
pre-alignment subnetwork to explore the influence of exposure, selectively
emphasizing the valuable features across different exposure levels. Then, the
enhanced features are fused by the asymmetric cross-feature fusion subnetwork,
which explores reference-dominated attention maps to improve image fusion by
aligning cross-scale features and performing cross-feature fusion. Finally, the
reconstruction subnetwork adopts a DWT-based multiscale architecture to reduce
ghosting artifacts and refine features at different resolutions. Extensive
experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, validating the great
potential of the DCS in HDR video reconstruction. The codes and data captured
by DCS will be available at https://github.com/zqqqyu/DCS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CMDCL, a cross-modal dual-causal learning method for long-term action recognition, addressing biases and confounders in vision-language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term action recognition is complex due to temporal spans and visual confounders. Existing methods lack cross-modal causal modeling, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: CMDCL uses a structural causal model to uncover causal relationships between videos and label texts, applying dual-causal interventions (textual and visual) to remove biases and confounders.

Result: Experiments on Charades, Breakfast, and COIN benchmarks show CMDCL's effectiveness in robust action representation.

Conclusion: CMDCL successfully addresses cross-modal biases and confounders, improving long-term action recognition performance.

Abstract: Long-term action recognition (LTAR) is challenging due to extended temporal
spans with complex atomic action correlations and visual confounders. Although
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise, they often rely on
statistical correlations instead of causal mechanisms. Moreover, existing
causality-based methods address modal-specific biases but lack cross-modal
causal modeling, limiting their utility in VLM-based LTAR. This paper proposes
\textbf{C}ross-\textbf{M}odal \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{C}ausal \textbf{L}earning
(CMDCL), which introduces a structural causal model to uncover causal
relationships between videos and label texts.
  CMDCL addresses cross-modal biases in text embeddings via textual causal
intervention and removes confounders inherent in the visual modality through
visual causal intervention guided by the debiased text.
  These dual-causal interventions enable robust action representations to
address LTAR challenges. Experimental results on three benchmarks including
Charades, Breakfast and COIN, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model. Our code is available at https://github.com/xushaowu/CMDCL.

*Qing Zhang,Guoquan Pei,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Omni-Fuse, a spatial-spectral fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation, improving performance by 5.73% in DSC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in fusing spatial and spectral data in Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) for disease diagnosis.

Method: Introduces cross-dimensional feature fusion, bidirectional attention, spectral-guided spatial query, and a two-stage decoder.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a 5.73% improvement in DSC.

Conclusion: Omni-Fuse effectively addresses fusion challenges in MHSI, enhancing segmentation performance.

Abstract: Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for
enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering
rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical
properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both
spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains
challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent
characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel
spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation,
named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature
fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that
refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention
mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most
spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage
cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the
selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains
efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image
datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation
performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent
improvement in DSC. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointVDP introduces view-dependent projection (VDP) for efficient point cloud segmentation, dynamically adapting to spatial geometry and reducing computational overhead compared to view-independent methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing projection-based methods rely on fixed parameters, limiting point awareness and projection diversity, while also causing computational inefficiency.

Method: VDP generates data-driven projections from 3D point distributions, inspired by fireworks, and uses color regularization to optimize feature emphasis and suppression.

Result: PointVDP achieves competitive results on S3DIS and ScanNet benchmarks with lightweight computational costs.

Conclusion: PointVDP offers a resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding in point cloud segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose view-dependent projection (VDP) to facilitate point
cloud segmentation, designing efficient 3D-to-2D mapping that dynamically
adapts to the spatial geometry from view variations. Existing projection-based
methods leverage view-independent projection in complex scenes, relying on
straight lines to generate direct rays or upward curves to reduce occlusions.
However, their view independence provides projection rays that are limited to
pre-defined parameters by human settings, restricting point awareness and
failing to capture sufficient projection diversity across different view
planes. Although multiple projections per view plane are commonly used to
enhance spatial variety, the projected redundancy leads to excessive
computational overhead and inefficiency in image processing. To address these
limitations, we design a framework of VDP to generate data-driven projections
from 3D point distributions, producing highly informative single-image inputs
by predicting rays inspired by the adaptive behavior of fireworks. In addition,
we construct color regularization to optimize the framework, which emphasizes
essential features within semantic pixels and suppresses the non-semantic
features within black pixels, thereby maximizing 2D space utilization in a
projected image. As a result, our approach, PointVDP, develops lightweight
projections in marginal computation costs. Experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet
benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive results, offering a
resource-efficient solution for semantic understanding.

TL;DR: EXAONE Path 2.0 improves biomarker prediction in digital pathology by using slide-level supervision for patch-level representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results with high data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current patch-level self-supervised learning (SSL) methods overlook domain-specific features and are less data-efficient, limiting their effectiveness in biomarker prediction tasks.

Method: EXAONE Path 2.0 learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level supervision, using only 37k whole-slide images (WSIs) for training.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency.

Conclusion: Slide-level supervision enhances patch-level representation learning, addressing the limitations of SSL methods in digital pathology.

Abstract: In digital pathology, whole-slide images (WSIs) are often difficult to handle
due to their gigapixel scale, so most approaches train patch encoders via
self-supervised learning (SSL) and then aggregate the patch-level embeddings
via multiple instance learning (MIL) or slide encoders for downstream tasks.
However, patch-level SSL may overlook complex domain-specific features that are
essential for biomarker prediction, such as mutation status and molecular
characteristics, as SSL methods rely only on basic augmentations selected for
natural image domains on small patch-level area. Moreover, SSL methods remain
less data efficient than fully supervised approaches, requiring extensive
computational resources and datasets to achieve competitive performance. To
address these limitations, we present EXAONE Path 2.0, a pathology foundation
model that learns patch-level representations under direct slide-level
supervision. Using only 37k WSIs for training, EXAONE Path 2.0 achieves
state-of-the-art average performance across 10 biomarker prediction tasks,
demonstrating remarkable data efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses learning dense keypoint localization from sparse pixel-level annotations in medical imaging, proposing a novel loss function (Crag and Tail loss) to handle sparse labels effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse labels in medical imaging, due to high annotation costs, hinder dense prediction tasks like keypoint localization. This work aims to overcome this challenge for 2D carcinosis keypoint localization in ovarian cancer diagnostics.

Method: The problem is framed as sparse heatmap regression. A new loss function, Crag and Tail loss, is introduced to efficiently learn from sparse annotations while mitigating false negatives.

Result: The approach achieves accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints, validated through extensive ablation studies.

Conclusion: The proposed method advances research in scenarios with limited dense annotations, demonstrating practical utility in medical imaging.

Abstract: Learning from sparse labels is a challenge commonplace in the medical domain.
This is due to numerous factors, such as annotation cost, and is especially
true for newly introduced tasks. When dense pixel-level annotations are needed,
this becomes even more unfeasible. However, being able to learn from just a few
annotations at the pixel-level, while extremely difficult and underutilized,
can drive progress in studies where perfect annotations are not immediately
available. This work tackles the challenge of learning the dense prediction
task of keypoint localization from a few point annotations in the context of 2d
carcinosis keypoint localization from laparoscopic video frames for diagnostic
planning of advanced ovarian cancer patients. To enable this, we formulate the
problem as a sparse heatmap regression from a few point annotations per image
and propose a new loss function, called Crag and Tail loss, for efficient
learning. Our proposed loss function effectively leverages positive sparse

Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving accurate dense localization of carcinosis keypoints,
highlighting its potential to advance research in scenarios where dense
annotations are challenging to obtain.

TL;DR: ClipGS is a Gaussian splatting framework for interactive cinematic visualization of medical data, improving rendering quality and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing diagnostic accuracy and surgical planning through high-quality visualization of volumetric medical data, despite computing cost and speed limitations.

Method: Introduces ClipGS with a learnable truncation scheme and adaptive adjustment model for dynamic interactions and rendering performance.

Result: Achieves 36.635 PSNR, 156 FPS, and 16.1 MB model size, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: ClipGS effectively addresses rendering challenges, offering superior quality and efficiency for medical data visualization.

Abstract: The visualization of volumetric medical data is crucial for enhancing
diagnostic accuracy and improving surgical planning and education. Cinematic
rendering techniques significantly enrich this process by providing
high-quality visualizations that convey intricate anatomical details, thereby
facilitating better understanding and decision-making in medical contexts.
However, the high computing cost and low rendering speed limit the requirement
of interactive visualization in practical applications. In this paper, we
introduce ClipGS, an innovative Gaussian splatting framework with the clipping
plane supported, for interactive cinematic visualization of volumetric medical
data. To address the challenges posed by dynamic interactions, we propose a
learnable truncation scheme that automatically adjusts the visibility of
Gaussian primitives in response to the clipping plane. Besides, we also design
an adaptive adjustment model to dynamically adjust the deformation of Gaussians
and refine the rendering performance. We validate our method on five volumetric
medical data (including CT and anatomical slice data), and reach an average
36.635 PSNR rendering quality with 156 FPS and 16.1 MB model size,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality and efficiency.

*Juncheng Mu,Chengwei Ren,Weixiang Zhang,Liang Pan,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diff$^2$I2P is a novel differentiable I2P registration framework using a diffusion prior to bridge the modality gap, outperforming SoTA methods by over 7% in registration recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2P registration methods struggle with accurate cross-modal correspondences due to the modality gap between images and point clouds.

Method: Proposes Diff$^2$I2P with Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) and Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) to enable differentiable correspondence retrieval and transformation estimation.

Result: Achieves over 7% improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Diff$^2$I2P effectively bridges the modality gap and improves cross-modal feature learning for robust I2P registration.

Abstract: Learning cross-modal correspondences is essential for image-to-point cloud
(I2P) registration. Existing methods achieve this mostly by utilizing metric
learning to enforce feature alignment across modalities, disregarding the
inherent modality gap between image and point data. Consequently, this paradigm
struggles to ensure accurate cross-modal correspondences. To this end, inspired
by the cross-modal generation success of recent large diffusion models, we
propose Diff$^2$I2P, a fully Differentiable I2P registration framework,
leveraging a novel and effective Diffusion prior for bridging the modality gap.
Specifically, we propose a Control-Side Score Distillation (CSD) technique to
distill knowledge from a depth-conditioned diffusion model to directly optimize
the predicted transformation. However, the gradients on the transformation fail
to backpropagate onto the cross-modal features due to the non-differentiability
of correspondence retrieval and PnP solver. To this end, we further propose a
Deformable Correspondence Tuning (DCT) module to estimate the correspondences
in a differentiable way, followed by the transformation estimation using a
differentiable PnP solver. With these two designs, the Diffusion model serves
as a strong prior to guide the cross-modal feature learning of image and point
cloud for forming robust correspondences, which significantly improves the
registration. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Diff$^2$I2P
consistently outperforms SoTA I2P registration methods, achieving over 7%
improvement in registration recall on the 7-Scenes benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CDR-CA, a task for refining diversity in Text-to-Image Retrieval by considering contextual attributes, and proposes Multi-Source DPPs as a solution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus only on appearance diversity, limiting practical applications due to varying contextual needs.

Method: Extends Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to multi-sources with a unified similarity matrix and introduces Tangent Normalization for context reflection.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel task and method for contextual diversity refinement, validated by experiments.

Abstract: Result diversification (RD) is a crucial technique in Text-to-Image Retrieval
for enhancing the efficiency of a practical application. Conventional methods
focus solely on increasing the diversity metric of image appearances. However,
the diversity metric and its desired value vary depending on the application,
which limits the applications of RD. This paper proposes a novel task called
CDR-CA (Contextual Diversity Refinement of Composite Attributes). CDR-CA aims
to refine the diversities of multiple attributes, according to the
application's context. To address this task, we propose Multi-Source DPPs, a
simple yet strong baseline that extends the Determinantal Point Process (DPP)
to multi-sources. We model MS-DPP as a single DPP model with a unified
similarity matrix based on a manifold representation. We also introduce Tangent
Normalization to reflect contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code is publicly available at

*Hongjie Wu,Mingqin Zhang,Linchao He,Ji-Zhe Zhou,Jiancheng Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper analyzes gradient dynamics in diffusion models for image restoration, identifies instabilities, and proposes SPGD to stabilize the process, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored interactions and instabilities between denoising and likelihood guidance steps in diffusion models for image restoration.

Method: Proposes SPGD, which includes progressive likelihood warm-up and adaptive directional momentum smoothing to manage gradients.

Result: SPGD enhances stability and achieves superior performance in restoration tasks, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SPGD effectively mitigates gradient conflicts and fluctuations, improving restoration quality and stability.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable promise for image restoration by
leveraging powerful priors. Prominent methods typically frame the restoration
problem within a Bayesian inference framework, which iteratively combines a
denoising step with a likelihood guidance step. However, the interactions
between these two components in the generation process remain underexplored. In
this paper, we analyze the underlying gradient dynamics of these components and
identify significant instabilities. Specifically, we demonstrate conflicts
between the prior and likelihood gradient directions, alongside temporal
fluctuations in the likelihood gradient itself. We show that these
instabilities disrupt the generative process and compromise restoration
performance. To address these issues, we propose Stabilized Progressive
Gradient Diffusion (SPGD), a novel gradient management technique. SPGD
integrates two synergistic components: (1) a progressive likelihood warm-up
strategy to mitigate gradient conflicts; and (2) adaptive directional momentum
(ADM) smoothing to reduce fluctuations in the likelihood gradient. Extensive
experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that SPGD
significantly enhances generation stability, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in quantitative metrics and visually superior results. Code is

Motivation: Addressing challenges like occlusion and generalization in category-level object pose estimation for applications like warehouse automation.

Method: Uses self-supervised keypoint detection with attention-based queries, soft heatmap matching, and graph-based relational modeling, plus a graph-enhanced feature fusion module.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in IoU and average precision on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D datasets.

Conclusion: MK-Pose is effective for category-level pose estimation, with strong performance and cross-dataset capability.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation, which predicts the pose of objects
within a known category without prior knowledge of individual instances, is
essential in applications like warehouse automation and manufacturing. Existing
methods relying on RGB images or point cloud data often struggle with object
occlusion and generalization across different instances and categories. This
paper proposes a multimodal-based keypoint learning framework (MK-Pose) that
integrates RGB images, point clouds, and category-level textual descriptions.
The model uses a self-supervised keypoint detection module enhanced with
attention-based query generation, soft heatmap matching and graph-based
relational modeling. Additionally, a graph-enhanced feature fusion module is
designed to integrate local geometric information and global context. MK-Pose
is evaluated on CAMERA25 and REAL275 dataset, and is further tested for
cross-dataset capability on HouseCat6D dataset. The results demonstrate that
MK-Pose outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both IoU and average
precision without shape priors. Codes will be released at

TL;DR: FlexGaussian introduces a flexible, training-free method for compressing 3D Gaussian splatting models, achieving high compression ratios with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient compression of large-scale 3D Gaussian models, especially for resource-constrained devices, without requiring retraining.

Method: Combines mixed-precision quantization and attribute-discriminative pruning for training-free compression.

Result: Achieves up to 96.4% compression with <1 dB PSNR drop, 1.7-2.1x faster than training-free methods, and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches.

Conclusion: FlexGaussian is a practical solution for high-quality, fast compression of 3D Gaussian models, suitable for mobile deployment.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting has become a prominent technique for representing and
rendering complex 3D scenes, due to its high fidelity and speed advantages.
However, the growing demand for large-scale models calls for effective
compression to reduce memory and computation costs, especially on mobile and
edge devices with limited resources. Existing compression methods effectively
reduce 3D Gaussian parameters but often require extensive retraining or
fine-tuning, lacking flexibility under varying compression constraints.
  In this paper, we introduce FlexGaussian, a flexible and cost-effective
method that combines mixed-precision quantization with attribute-discriminative
pruning for training-free 3D Gaussian compression. FlexGaussian eliminates the
need for retraining and adapts easily to diverse compression targets.
Evaluation results show that FlexGaussian achieves up to 96.4% compression
while maintaining high rendering quality (<1 dB drop in PSNR), and is
deployable on mobile devices. FlexGaussian delivers high compression ratios
within seconds, being 1.7-2.1x faster than state-of-the-art training-free
methods and 10-100x faster than training-involved approaches. The code is being

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack quantity awareness for accurate object counting, prompting the need for enhanced methods.

Method: QUANet uses quantity-oriented text prompts, a vision-text alignment loss, and a dual-stream decoder (Transformer and CNN) with T2C-adapters for density map prediction.

Result: The model demonstrates strong generalizability in zero-shot class-agnostic counting on benchmarks like FSC-147 and ShanghaiTech.

Conclusion: QUANet effectively addresses quantity awareness in VLMs, advancing text-promptable object counting.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
progress in solving the text-promptable object counting problem. Representative
methods typically specify text prompts with object category information in
images. This however is insufficient for training the model to accurately
distinguish the number of objects in the counting task. To this end, we propose
QUANet, which introduces novel quantity-oriented text prompts with a
vision-text quantity alignment loss to enhance the model's quantity awareness.
Moreover, we propose a dual-stream adaptive counting decoder consisting of a
Transformer stream, a CNN stream, and a number of Transformer-to-CNN
enhancement adapters (T2C-adapters) for density map prediction. The
T2C-adapters facilitate the effective knowledge communication and aggregation
between the Transformer and CNN streams. A cross-stream quantity ranking loss
is proposed in the end to optimize the ranking orders of predictions from the
two streams. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks such as FSC-147,
CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech demonstrate our model's strong generalizability
for zero-shot class-agnostic counting. Code is available at

TL;DR: STG-Mamba is a novel method for music-guided dance video synthesis, combining music-to-skeleton and skeleton-to-video translations with a new dataset and outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To translate input music into dance videos by effectively capturing spatial-temporal dependencies and improving synthesis quality.

Method: Uses STGM blocks for music-to-skeleton translation and a self-supervised regularization network for skeleton-to-video translation, supported by a new dataset.

Result: STG-Mamba achieves significantly better results than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively synthesizes dance videos from music, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: We propose a novel spatial-temporal graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) for the
music-guided dance video synthesis task, i.e., to translate the input music to
a dance video. STG-Mamba consists of two translation mappings:
music-to-skeleton translation and skeleton-to-video translation. In the
music-to-skeleton translation, we introduce a novel spatial-temporal graph
Mamba (STGM) block to effectively construct skeleton sequences from the input
music, capturing dependencies between joints in both the spatial and temporal
dimensions. For the skeleton-to-video translation, we propose a novel
self-supervised regularization network to translate the generated skeletons,
along with a conditional image, into a dance video. Lastly, we collect a new
skeleton-to-video translation dataset from the Internet, containing 54,944
video clips. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STG-Mamba achieves

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SpatialReasoner, a framework for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding with enhanced spatial reasoning using LLMs and hierarchical feature fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with spatial relations in language queries for 3D object localization, limiting their accuracy in complex environments.

Method: SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM for spatial reasoning in queries and constructs a hierarchical feature field with visual properties (opacity, color) using CLIP and SAM.

Result: The framework outperforms baselines in 3D visual grounding and enhances spatial reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SpatialReasoner effectively addresses spatial relation challenges in 3D visual grounding and integrates well with neural representations.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on
free-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such
as autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language
fields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D
scenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target
objects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods
struggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language
queries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from
inadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D
scenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural
representation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial
reasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature
field for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in
language queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial
relations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial
relation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner
incorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical
feature field. This field represents language and instance features using
distilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a
hierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial
relation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework
can be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,
outperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their
spatial reasoning capability.

TL;DR: A hierarchical pre-training strategy for gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT) improves translation quality by aligning video features with pseudo-glosses and spoken sentences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SLT methods face challenges in aligning visual and textual representations, with gloss-based and gloss-free approaches each having limitations.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical pre-training strategy using pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language alignment at frame, segment, and video levels.

Result: The method enhances BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while remaining efficient.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical approach effectively bridges the gap in gloss-free SLT, improving translation performance.

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) attempts to convert sign language videos into
spoken sentences. However, many existing methods struggle with the disparity
between visual and textual representations during end-to-end learning.
Gloss-based approaches help to bridge this gap by leveraging structured
linguistic information. While, gloss-free methods offer greater flexibility and
remove the burden of annotation, they require effective alignment strategies.
Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled gloss-free SLT by
generating text-like representations from sign videos. In this work, we
introduce a novel hierarchical pre-training strategy inspired by the structure
of sign language, incorporating pseudo-glosses and contrastive video-language
alignment. Our method hierarchically extracts features at frame, segment, and
video levels, aligning them with pseudo-glosses and the spoken sentence to
enhance translation quality. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves
BLEU-4 and ROUGE scores while maintaining efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios without synthetic data or memory banks.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances CLIP's adaptability for medical AD, offering robust performance across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging
modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel
approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal
Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to
medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which
often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts
aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further
enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios
without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at

TL;DR: RPFNet, a Residual Prior-driven Frequency-aware Network, addresses image fusion challenges by combining residual priors and frequency-domain modeling for efficient global feature integration and enhanced complementary feature capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image fusion lacks ground-truth and efficient global spatial modeling, making complementary feature capture difficult. RPFNet aims to solve these issues.

Method: RPFNet uses a dual-branch framework: Residual Prior Module (RPM) for complementary priors, Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) for global feature modeling, and Cross Promotion Module (CPM) for local-global synergy. Training includes auxiliary decoder, saliency structure loss, and frequency contrastive loss.

Result: RPFNet effectively integrates features, enhances texture details, and improves high-level vision task performance, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: RPFNet successfully addresses image fusion challenges, improving feature integration and performance in high-level vision tasks.

Abstract: Image fusion aims to integrate complementary information across modalities to
generate high-quality fused images, thereby enhancing the performance of
high-level vision tasks. While global spatial modeling mechanisms show
promising results, constructing long-range feature dependencies in the spatial
domain incurs substantial computational costs. Additionally, the absence of
ground-truth exacerbates the difficulty of capturing complementary features
effectively. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Residual Prior-driven
Frequency-aware Network, termed as RPFNet. Specifically, RPFNet employs a
dual-branch feature extraction framework: the Residual Prior Module (RPM)
extracts modality-specific difference information from residual maps, thereby
providing complementary priors for fusion; the Frequency Domain Fusion Module
(FDFM) achieves efficient global feature modeling and integration through
frequency-domain convolution. Additionally, the Cross Promotion Module (CPM)
enhances the synergistic perception of local details and global structures
through bidirectional feature interaction. During training, we incorporate an
auxiliary decoder and saliency structure loss to strengthen the model's
sensitivity to modality-specific differences. Furthermore, a combination of
adaptive weight-based frequency contrastive loss and SSIM loss effectively
constrains the solution space, facilitating the joint capture of local details
and global features while ensuring the retention of complementary information.
Extensive experiments validate the fusion performance of RPFNet, which
effectively integrates discriminative features, enhances texture details and
salient objects, and can effectively facilitate the deployment of the
high-level vision task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized datasets for high-precision industrial processes like semiconductor manufacturing limits research.

Method: Proposes DIFFUMA, a dual-path architecture combining Mamba for global context and diffusion for fine-grained details.

Result: DIFFUMA reduces MSE by 39% and improves SSIM to 0.988 on CHDL, also generalizing to natural datasets.

Conclusion: The work provides a SOTA model and a valuable dataset to advance industrial AI research.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video prediction plays a pivotal role in critical domains,
ranging from weather forecasting to industrial automation. However, in
high-precision industrial scenarios such as semiconductor manufacturing, the
absence of specialized benchmark datasets severely hampers research on modeling
and predicting complex processes. To address this challenge, we make a twofold
contribution.First, we construct and release the Chip Dicing Lane Dataset
(CHDL), the first public temporal image dataset dedicated to the semiconductor
wafer dicing process. Captured via an industrial-grade vision system, CHDL
provides a much-needed and challenging benchmark for high-fidelity process
modeling, defect detection, and digital twin development.Second, we propose
DIFFUMA, an innovative dual-path prediction architecture specifically designed
for such fine-grained dynamics. The model captures global long-range temporal
context through a parallel Mamba module, while simultaneously leveraging a
diffusion module, guided by temporal features, to restore and enhance
fine-grained spatial details, effectively combating feature degradation.
Experiments demonstrate that on our CHDL benchmark, DIFFUMA significantly
outperforms existing methods, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 39% and
improving the Structural Similarity (SSIM) from 0.926 to a near-perfect 0.988.
This superior performance also generalizes to natural phenomena datasets. Our
work not only delivers a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) model but, more
importantly, provides the community with an invaluable data resource to drive
future research in industrial AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces PCA caching and DynCFGCache to improve video generation speed by dynamically adjusting reuse thresholds based on scene complexity and selectively reusing CFG outputs, achieving a 2.79x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-frequency caching degrades quality in complex scenes, and manual tuning is inefficient. The paper aims to automate and optimize caching for better performance.

Method: Proposes PCA caching for adaptive reuse thresholds using prompt-derived complexity and DynCFGCache for dynamic CFG output reuse. Enhances modeling accuracy with multivariate polynomial feature expansion.

Result: Achieves a 2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model while maintaining visual fidelity across diverse scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively balance speed and quality in video generation by leveraging adaptive caching and dynamic reuse mechanisms.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video generation, inference speed remains a major
bottleneck. A common acceleration strategy involves reusing model outputs via
caching mechanisms at fixed intervals. However, we find that such
fixed-frequency reuse significantly degrades quality in complex scenes, while
manually tuning reuse thresholds is inefficient and lacks robustness. To
address this, we propose Prompt-Complexity-Aware (PCA) caching, a method that
automatically adjusts reuse thresholds based on scene complexity estimated
directly from the input prompt. By incorporating prompt-derived semantic cues,
PCA enables more adaptive and informed reuse decisions than conventional
caching methods. We also revisit the assumptions behind TeaCache and identify a
key limitation: it suffers from poor input-output relationship modeling due to
an oversimplified prior. To overcome this, we decouple the noisy input, enhance
the contribution of meaningful textual information, and improve the model's
predictive accuracy through multivariate polynomial feature expansion. To
further reduce computational cost, we replace the static CFGCache with
DynCFGCache, a dynamic mechanism that selectively reuses classifier-free
guidance (CFG) outputs based on estimated output variations. This allows for
more flexible reuse without compromising output quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves significant acceleration-for example,
2.79x speedup on the Wan2.1 model-while maintaining high visual fidelity across
a range of scenes.

Method: Introduces local-and-global dual-granularity identity association: local cross-modal identity relationships within batches and a global dynamic cross-modal network with confidence-based adjustment. Also uses asymmetric sample pairs and consistency learning.

Result: Significantly improves cross-modal matching accuracy.

Conclusion: The method offers an efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching by enhancing identity association and robustness.

Abstract: Weakly supervised text-to-person image matching, as a crucial approach to
reducing models' reliance on large-scale manually labeled samples, holds
significant research value. However, existing methods struggle to predict
complex one-to-many identity relationships, severely limiting performance
improvements. To address this challenge, we propose a local-and-global
dual-granularity identity association mechanism. Specifically, at the local
level, we explicitly establish cross-modal identity relationships within a
batch, reinforcing identity constraints across different modalities and
enabling the model to better capture subtle differences and correlations. At
the global level, we construct a dynamic cross-modal identity association
network with the visual modality as the anchor and introduce a confidence-based
dynamic adjustment mechanism, effectively enhancing the model's ability to
identify weakly associated samples while improving overall sensitivity.
Additionally, we propose an information-asymmetric sample pair construction
method combined with consistency learning to tackle hard sample mining and
enhance model robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method substantially boosts cross-modal matching accuracy, providing an
efficient and practical solution for text-to-person image matching.

TL;DR: The study develops high-performing OCR systems for the endangered Manchu language using fine-tuned vision-language models, achieving exceptional accuracy on both synthetic and real-world documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manchu is critically endangered and lacks effective OCR systems for historical documents, hindering digital humanities research.

Method: Fine-tuned three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using parameter-efficient training.

Result: LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved 98.3% word accuracy on synthetic data and 93.1% on real-world handwritten documents, outperforming traditional CRNN baselines.

Conclusion: The approach provides a cost-effective, transferable framework for endangered language OCR, enabling historians and linguists to process archives without specialized resources.

Abstract: Manchu, a critically endangered language essential for understanding early
modern Eastern Eurasian history, lacks effective OCR systems that can handle
real-world historical documents. This study develops high-performing OCR
systems by fine-tuning three open-source vision-language models (LLaMA-3.2-11B,
Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-3B) on 60,000 synthetic Manchu word images using
parameter-efficient training. LLaMA-3.2-11B achieved exceptional performance
with 98.3\% word accuracy and 0.0024 character error rate on synthetic data,
while crucially maintaining 93.1\% accuracy on real-world handwritten
documents. Comparative evaluation reveals substantial advantages over
traditional approaches: while a CRNN baseline achieved 99.8\% synthetic
accuracy, it suffered severe degradation to 72.5\% on real documents. Our
approach demonstrates effective synthetic-to-real domain transfer, providing a
cost-effective solution deployable on accessible infrastructure. This work
establishes a transferable framework for endangered language OCR that removes
technical and financial barriers in digital humanities, enabling historians and
linguists to process historical archives without specialized computing
resources. Code and model weights are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address performance degradation in SOTA models when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal MRI views.

Method: Introduces FOLC-Net with MRFO for model structure, global model cloning for scalability, and ConvNeXt for client adaptability.

Result: Achieves 92.44% accuracy in sagittal view, surpassing DL models (88.37%-88.95%), and improves accuracy across all views.

Conclusion: FOLC-Net provides a robust, adaptable solution for decentralized medical image analysis, overcoming SOTA limitations.

Abstract: The framework is designed to improve performance in the analysis of combined
as well as single anatomical perspectives for MRI disease diagnosis. It
specifically addresses the performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art
(SOTA) models, particularly when processing axial, coronal, and sagittal
anatomical planes. The paper introduces the FOLC-Net framework, which
incorporates a novel federated-optimized lightweight architecture with
approximately 1.217 million parameters and a storage requirement of only 0.9
MB. FOLC-Net integrates Manta-ray foraging optimization (MRFO) mechanisms for
efficient model structure generation, global model cloning for scalable
training, and ConvNeXt for enhanced client adaptability. The model was
evaluated on combined multi-view data as well as individual views, such as
axial, coronal, and sagittal, to assess its robustness in various medical
imaging scenarios. Moreover, FOLC-Net tests a ShallowFed model on different
data to evaluate its ability to generalize beyond the training dataset. The
results show that FOLC-Net outperforms existing models, particularly in the
challenging sagittal view. For instance, FOLC-Net achieved an accuracy of
92.44% on the sagittal view, significantly higher than the 88.37% accuracy of
study method (DL + Residual Learning) and 88.95% of DL models. Additionally,
FOLC-Net demonstrated improved accuracy across all individual views, providing
a more reliable and robust solution for medical image analysis in decentralized
environments. FOLC-Net addresses the limitations of existing SOTA models by
providing a framework that ensures better adaptability to individual views
while maintaining strong performance in multi-view settings. The incorporation
of MRFO, global model cloning, and ConvNeXt ensures that FOLC-Net performs
better in real-world medical applications.

*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Andreja Jurasovic,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pipeline generates synthetic thermal aerial images to expand datasets for deep learning, improving object detection in UAV applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of diverse thermal aerial datasets hinders deep learning progress in UAV-based thermal imaging for search, rescue, and monitoring.

Method: A procedural pipeline synthesizes thermal images by integrating objects into existing backgrounds, controlling position, scale, and orientation.

Result: Enhanced datasets (HIT-UAV and MONET) show strong object detection performance, with thermal detectors outperforming visible-light models.

Conclusion: Synthetic thermal data generation effectively addresses dataset scarcity, advancing UAV thermal imaging applications.

Abstract: Thermal imaging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) holds significant
potential for applications in search and rescue, wildlife monitoring, and
emergency response, especially under low-light or obscured conditions. However,
the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the
advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high
cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we
introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images
from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into
existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and
orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the
background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object
categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the
HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating
these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across
both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new
applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors
outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the
importance of replicating aerial viewing angles. Project page:

TL;DR: GreenHyperSpectra is a pretraining dataset for plant trait prediction using hyperspectral data, addressing label scarcity and domain shifts. It enables label-efficient models that outperform supervised baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional field sampling cannot cover trait variation at ecologically meaningful scales, and hyperspectral data prediction faces challenges like label scarcity and domain shifts.

Method: Uses GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset with cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples, and evaluates models in in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios.

Result: Pretrained models outperform state-of-the-art supervised baselines, improving spectral representations for trait prediction.

Conclusion: GreenHyperSpectra provides a robust framework for advancing plant trait prediction, bridging representation learning and functional trait assessment.

Abstract: Plant traits such as leaf carbon content and leaf mass are essential
variables in the study of biodiversity and climate change. However,
conventional field sampling cannot feasibly cover trait variation at
ecologically meaningful spatial scales. Machine learning represents a valuable
solution for plant trait prediction across ecosystems, leveraging hyperspectral
data from remote sensing. Nevertheless, trait prediction from hyperspectral
data is challenged by label scarcity and substantial domain shifts (\eg across
sensors, ecological distributions), requiring robust cross-domain methods.
Here, we present GreenHyperSpectra, a pretraining dataset encompassing
real-world cross-sensor and cross-ecosystem samples designed to benchmark trait
prediction with semi- and self-supervised methods. We adopt an evaluation
framework encompassing in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. We
successfully leverage GreenHyperSpectra to pretrain label-efficient
multi-output regression models that outperform the state-of-the-art supervised
baseline. Our empirical analyses demonstrate substantial improvements in
learning spectral representations for trait prediction, establishing a
comprehensive methodological framework to catalyze research at the intersection
of representation learning and plant functional traits assessment. All code and

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Deliberate-to-Intuitive (D2I) framework to enhance multimodal reasoning in LLMs without extra annotations or complex rewards, improving performance across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the high training costs and scalability issues in multimodal reasoning research, particularly due to reliance on additional data annotation and rule-based rewards.

Method: Proposes D2I, which uses deliberate reasoning strategies with rule-based format rewards during training and shifts to intuitive reasoning during evaluation.

Result: D2I outperforms baselines in both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating improved reasoning and alignment.

Conclusion: The framework highlights the effectiveness of format rewards for transferable reasoning skills and suggests decoupling training-time reasoning depth from test-time flexibility.

Abstract: Reasoning is a key capability for large language models (LLMs), particularly
when applied to complex tasks such as mathematical problem solving. However,
multimodal reasoning research still requires further exploration of modality
alignment and training costs. Many of these approaches rely on additional data
annotation and relevant rule-based rewards to enhance the understanding and
reasoning ability, which significantly increases training costs and limits
scalability. To address these challenges, we propose the
Deliberate-to-Intuitive reasoning framework (D2I) that improves the
understanding and reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) without extra
annotations and complex rewards. Specifically, our method sets deliberate
reasoning strategies to enhance modality alignment only through the rule-based
format reward during training. While evaluating, the reasoning style shifts to
intuitive, which removes deliberate reasoning strategies during training and
implicitly reflects the model's acquired abilities in the response. D2I
outperforms baselines across both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. Our
findings highlight the role of format reward in fostering transferable
reasoning skills in MLLMs, and inspire directions for decoupling training-time
reasoning depth from test-time response flexibility.

*Xu Yang,Shaoli Huang,Shenbo Xie,Xuelin Chen,Yifei Liu,Changxing Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for co-speech gesture video generation uses 2D skeletons and a diffusion model to align audio with visual outputs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task is challenging due to audio-visual one-to-many mapping, lack of large datasets, and high computational costs.

Method: Uses 2D skeletons and a diffusion model conditioned on audio segments and reference images, fused with skeleton-audio features for motion prediction.

Result: Exceeds state-of-the-art in visual quality and synchronization, generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed method and new dataset (CSG-405) advance co-speech gesture generation research.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture video generation aims to synthesize realistic,
audio-aligned videos of speakers, complete with synchronized facial expressions
and body gestures. This task presents challenges due to the significant
one-to-many mapping between audio and visual content, further complicated by
the scarcity of large-scale public datasets and high computational demands. We
propose a lightweight framework that utilizes 2D full-body skeletons as an
efficient auxiliary condition to bridge audio signals with visual outputs. Our
approach introduces a diffusion model conditioned on fine-grained audio
segments and a skeleton extracted from the speaker's reference image,
predicting skeletal motions through skeleton-audio feature fusion to ensure
strict audio coordination and body shape consistency. The generated skeletons
are then fed into an off-the-shelf human video generation model with the
speaker's reference image to synthesize high-fidelity videos. To democratize
research, we present CSG-405-the first public dataset with 405 hours of
high-resolution videos across 71 speech types, annotated with 2D skeletons and
diverse speaker demographics. Experiments show that our method exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches in visual quality and synchronization while
generalizing across speakers and contexts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new color space (HVI) and a network (HVI-CIDNet+) for low-light image enhancement, addressing color bias and noise artifacts while outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods in sRGB and HSV color spaces suffer from color bias, brightness artifacts, and noise issues, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: Proposes the HVI color space to mitigate red and black noise artifacts and introduces HVI-CIDNet+, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models and a Prior-guided Attention Block for content restoration and color correction.

Result: HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 10 benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance in low-light image enhancement.

Conclusion: The HVI color space and HVI-CIDNet+ effectively address limitations of existing methods, offering improved performance in restoring low-light images.

Abstract: Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) aims to restore vivid content and details
from corrupted low-light images. However, existing standard RGB (sRGB) color
space-based LLIE methods often produce color bias and brightness artifacts due
to the inherent high color sensitivity. While Hue, Saturation, and Value (HSV)
color space can decouple brightness and color, it introduces significant red
and black noise artifacts. To address this problem, we propose a new color
space for LLIE, namely Horizontal/Vertical-Intensity (HVI), defined by the HV
color map and learnable intensity. The HV color map enforces small distances
for the red coordinates to remove red noise artifacts, while the learnable
intensity compresses the low-light regions to remove black noise artifacts.
Additionally, we introduce the Color and Intensity Decoupling Network+
(HVI-CIDNet+), built upon the HVI color space, to restore damaged content and
mitigate color distortion in extremely dark regions. Specifically, HVI-CIDNet+
leverages abundant contextual and degraded knowledge extracted from low-light
images using pre-trained vision-language models, integrated via a novel
Prior-guided Attention Block (PAB). Within the PAB, latent semantic priors can
promote content restoration, while degraded representations guide precise color
correction, both particularly in extremely dark regions through the
meticulously designed cross-attention fusion mechanism. Furthermore, we
construct a Region Refinement Block that employs convolution for
information-rich regions and self-attention for information-scarce regions,
ensuring accurate brightness adjustments. Comprehensive results from benchmark
experiments demonstrate that the proposed HVI-CIDNet+ outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework combines symbolic regression and trajectory-guided I2V models to improve physical accuracy in video generation by discovering motion equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack physical alignment due to reliance on statistical correlations, not physical laws.

Method: Extracts motion trajectories, uses retrieval-based pre-training for symbolic regression, and guides video generation with discovered equations.

Result: Successfully recovers ground-truth equations and improves physical alignment in videos for Classical Mechanics scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework enhances physical realism in video generation without fine-tuning existing models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based and autoregressive video generation models
have achieved remarkable visual realism. However, these models typically lack
accurate physical alignment, failing to replicate real-world dynamics in object
motion. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on learned
statistical correlations rather than capturing mechanisms adhering to physical
laws. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework that integrates
symbolic regression (SR) and trajectory-guided image-to-video (I2V) models for
physics-grounded video forecasting. Our approach extracts motion trajectories
from input videos, uses a retrieval-based pre-training mechanism to enhance
symbolic regression, and discovers equations of motion to forecast physically
accurate future trajectories. These trajectories then guide video generation
without requiring fine-tuning of existing models. Evaluated on scenarios in
Classical Mechanics, including spring-mass, pendulums, and projectile motions,
our method successfully recovers ground-truth analytical equations and improves
the physical alignment of generated videos over baseline methods.

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end WSSS method using ViT attention maps, outperforming traditional approaches with accurate pseudo-masks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on external modules and improve interpretability of self-attention maps for WSSS.

Method: Trains a sparse ViT with multiple [CLS] tokens and random masking, aggregating self-attention maps for pseudo-mask generation.

Result: Outperforms related works on benchmarks, generating accurate pseudo-masks comparable to fully-supervised models.

Conclusion: The method reduces dependency on fine-grained labels, offering a viable alternative to fully-supervised segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that
has been extensively studied in recent years. Traditional approaches often rely
on external modules like Class Activation Maps to highlight regions of interest
and generate pseudo segmentation masks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end
method that directly utilizes the attention maps learned by a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for WSSS. We propose training a sparse ViT with multiple
[CLS] tokens (one for each class), using a random masking strategy to promote
[CLS] token - class assignment. At inference time, we aggregate the different
self-attention maps of each [CLS] token corresponding to the predicted labels
to generate pseudo segmentation masks. Our proposed approach enhances the
interpretability of self-attention maps and ensures accurate class assignments.
Extensive experiments on two standard benchmarks and three specialized datasets
demonstrate that our method generates accurate pseudo-masks, outperforming
related works. Those pseudo-masks can be used to train a segmentation model
which achieves results comparable to fully-supervised models, significantly
reducing the need for fine-grained labeled data.

*Subrat Kishore Dutta,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAP introduces a framework for generating highly invisible adversarial patches by optimizing patch location and perturbation for stealth and effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior adversarial patch methods lack stealth and effectiveness in targeted attacks, making them noticeable or ineffective against defenses.

Method: IAP uses perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization, balancing model susceptibility and human visual perception, with color constancy for invisibility.

Result: IAP achieves high attack success rates with improved invisibility, outperforming baselines and bypassing state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: IAP is a stealthy and effective adversarial patch framework, enhancing both invisibility and attack performance.

Abstract: Despite modifying only a small localized input region, adversarial patches
can drastically change the prediction of computer vision models. However, prior
methods either cannot perform satisfactorily under targeted attack scenarios or
fail to produce contextually coherent adversarial patches, causing them to be
easily noticeable by human examiners and insufficiently stealthy against
automatic patch defenses. In this paper, we introduce IAP, a novel attack
framework that generates highly invisible adversarial patches based on
perceptibility-aware localization and perturbation optimization schemes.
Specifically, IAP first searches for a proper location to place the patch by
leveraging classwise localization and sensitivity maps, balancing the
susceptibility of patch location to both victim model prediction and human
visual system, then employs a perceptibility-regularized adversarial loss and a
gradient update rule that prioritizes color constancy for optimizing invisible
perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across various image benchmarks and
model architectures demonstrate that IAP consistently achieves competitive
attack success rates in targeted settings with significantly improved patch
invisibility compared to existing baselines. In addition to being highly
imperceptible to humans, IAP is shown to be stealthy enough to render several
state-of-the-art patch defenses ineffective.

Method: Conducted a 2.5-year study with 400+ diverse participants using GDPR-compliant biometric tools and face recognition algorithms to analyze long-term comparison scores.

Result: Biometric scores fluctuate more between individual days than over the entire measurement period.

Conclusion: Long-term controlled testing is crucial for accurate biometric analysis and future advancements in the field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing semantic scene understanding for autonomous vehicles, especially in adverse weather, where cameras and LiDARs face limitations.

Method: Proposes SemRaFiner, which optimizes feature extraction for sparse radar point clouds and refines training with dedicated data augmentation.

Result: Outperforms existing radar-based panoptic segmentation methods.

Conclusion: SemRaFiner effectively addresses challenges in radar-based scene understanding, offering improved accuracy for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semantic scene understanding, including the perception and classification of
moving agents, is essential to enabling safe and robust driving behaviours of
autonomous vehicles. Cameras and LiDARs are commonly used for semantic scene
understanding. However, both sensor modalities face limitations in adverse
weather and usually do not provide motion information. Radar sensors overcome
these limitations and directly offer information about moving agents by
measuring the Doppler velocity, but the measurements are comparably sparse and
noisy. In this paper, we address the problem of panoptic segmentation in sparse
radar point clouds to enhance scene understanding. Our approach, called
SemRaFiner, accounts for changing density in sparse radar point clouds and
optimizes the feature extraction to improve accuracy. Furthermore, we propose
an optimized training procedure to refine instance assignments by incorporating
a dedicated data augmentation. Our experiments suggest that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods for radar-based panoptic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APL introduces adaptive part discovery and learning for GCD, improving discriminability and generalization without extra annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GCD methods rely on global DINO CLS token representations, creating a trade-off between discriminability and generalization.

Method: APL uses shared learnable part queries and DINO priors to generate consistent object parts, employing an all-min contrastive loss for part representation.

Result: APL enhances GCD frameworks by replacing CLS token features with part representations, showing significant improvements on fine-grained datasets.

Conclusion: APL effectively balances discriminability and generalization in GCD, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from
known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones, while
also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known
classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such
as DINO for representation learning. However, focusing solely on the global
representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between
discriminability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive
part discovery and learning method, called APL, which generates consistent
object parts and their correspondences across different similar images using a
set of shared learnable part queries and DINO part priors, without requiring
any additional annotations. More importantly, we propose a novel all-min
contrastive loss to learn discriminative yet generalizable part representation,
which adaptively highlights discriminative object parts to distinguish similar
categories for enhanced discriminability while simultaneously sharing other
parts to facilitate knowledge transfer for improved generalization. Our APL can
easily be incorporated into different GCD frameworks by replacing their CLS
token feature with our part representations, showing significant enhancements
on fine-grained datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Multi-Attribute Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD) is introduced to address the scarcity of detailed calligraphy datasets, featuring 329,715 samples with rich annotations for styles, dynasties, and calligraphers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing calligraphy datasets lack attribute information, hindering in-depth research. MCCD aims to fill this gap by providing detailed annotations.

Method: MCCD includes 7,765 categories with 329,715 calligraphy character images, annotated for script styles, dynasties, and calligraphers. Benchmark experiments were conducted for recognition tasks.

Result: Recognition experiments show increased difficulty due to stroke complexity and attribute interplay. MCCD serves as a valuable resource for diverse research tasks.

Conclusion: MCCD addresses dataset scarcity, enabling advanced research in Chinese calligraphy and related fields. The dataset is publicly available.

Abstract: Research on the attribute information of calligraphy, such as styles,
dynasties, and calligraphers, holds significant cultural and historical value.
However, the styles of Chinese calligraphy characters have evolved dramatically
through different dynasties and the unique touches of calligraphers, making it
highly challenging to accurately recognize these different characters and their
attributes. Furthermore, existing calligraphic datasets are extremely scarce,
and most provide only character-level annotations without additional attribute
information. This limitation has significantly hindered the in-depth study of
Chinese calligraphy. To fill this gap, we present a novel Multi-Attribute
Chinese Calligraphy Character Dataset (MCCD). The dataset encompasses 7,765
categories with a total of 329,715 isolated image samples of Chinese
calligraphy characters, and three additional subsets were extracted based on
the attribute labeling of the three types of script styles (10 types),
dynasties (15 periods) and calligraphers (142 individuals). The rich
multi-attribute annotations render MCCD well-suited diverse research tasks,
including calligraphic character recognition, writer identification, and
evolutionary studies of Chinese characters. We establish benchmark performance
through single-task and multi-task recognition experiments across MCCD and all
of its subsets. The experimental results demonstrate that the complexity of the
stroke structure of the calligraphic characters, and the interplay between
their different attributes, leading to a substantial increase in the difficulty
of accurate recognition. MCCD not only fills a void in the availability of
detailed calligraphy datasets but also provides valuable resources for
advancing research in Chinese calligraphy and fostering advancements in
multiple fields. The dataset is available at

Motivation: To understand the long-term effects of ancient human management on Neotropical forests at high-resolution scales.

Method: Combines deep learning on satellite imagery to detect palm trees, clustering algorithms to identify palm clusters, and correlates these with archaeological sites.

Result: Palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological sites, suggesting ancient human-managed areas were much larger than archaeological evidence alone indicates.

Conclusion: Pre-Columbian populations influenced vegetation, fostering palm proliferation, and integrating AI with ecological data can reveal fine-scale human-environment interactions.

Abstract: Ancient populations markedly transformed Neotropical forests, yet
understanding the long-term effects of ancient human management, particularly
at high-resolution scales, remains challenging. In this work we propose a new
approach to investigate archaeological areas of influence based on vegetation
signatures. It consists of a deep learning model trained on satellite imagery
to identify palm trees, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify palm
clusters, which are then used to estimate ancient management areas. To assess
the palm distribution in relation to past human activity, we applied the
proposed approach to unique high-resolution satellite imagery data covering 765
km2 of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. With this work, we also
release a manually annotated palm tree dataset along with estimated locations
of archaeological sites from ground-surveys and legacy records. Results
demonstrate how palms were significantly more abundant near archaeological
sites showing large infrastructure investment. The extent of the largest palm
cluster indicates that ancient human-managed areas linked to major
infrastructure sites may be up to two orders of magnitude bigger than indicated
by archaeological evidence alone. Our findings suggest that pre-Columbian
populations influenced local vegetation fostering conditions conducive to palm
proliferation, leaving a lasting ecological footprint. This may have lowered
the logistical costs of establishing infrastructure-heavy settlements in
otherwise less accessible locations. Overall, this study demonstrates the
potential of integrating artificial intelligence approaches with new ecological
and archaeological data to identify archaeological areas of interest through
vegetation patterns, revealing fine-scale human-environment interactions.

*Xiao Liang,Jiawei Hu,Di Wang,Zhi Ma,Lin Zhao,Ronghan Li,Bo Wan,Quan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CheXPO, a strategy for optimizing VLMs in medical applications, reduces hallucinations by combining confidence-similarity mining and counterfactual rationales, achieving 8.93% performance gain with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs in medical applications suffer from hallucinations, and existing preference optimization methods face challenges like irrelevant samples, data imbalance, and high expert costs.

Method: CheXPO synthesizes a multi-task chest X-ray dataset, identifies hard examples via token-level confidence analysis, and uses similarity-based retrieval and counterfactual rationales for balanced preferences.

Result: CheXPO achieves an 8.93% performance gain with only 5% of SFT samples, reaching state-of-the-art performance in clinical tasks.

Conclusion: CheXPO provides a scalable, interpretable solution for radiology, reducing reliance on expert annotations while improving reliability.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations that critically
compromise reliability in medical applications. While preference optimization
can mitigate these hallucinations through clinical feedback, its implementation
faces challenges such as clinically irrelevant training samples, imbalanced
data distributions, and prohibitive expert annotation costs. To address these
challenges, we introduce CheXPO, a Chest X-ray Preference Optimization strategy
that combines confidence-similarity joint mining with counterfactual rationale.
Our approach begins by synthesizing a unified, fine-grained multi-task chest
X-ray visual instruction dataset across different question types for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). We then identify hard examples through token-level
confidence analysis of SFT failures and use similarity-based retrieval to
expand hard examples for balancing preference sample distributions, while
synthetic counterfactual rationales provide fine-grained clinical preferences,
eliminating the need for additional expert input. Experiments show that CheXPO
achieves 8.93% relative performance gain using only 5% of SFT samples, reaching
state-of-the-art performance across diverse clinical tasks and providing a
scalable, interpretable solution for real-world radiology applications.

TL;DR: A deep learning method (ProRSeg) for domain-invariant MR-MR registration was developed and tested, showing reasonable performance for contour propagation and dose accumulation in prostate cancer MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is essential for contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy (MRgART). The study aims to develop a domain-invariant DIR method for MR-MR registration.

Method: ProRSeg, a progressively refined registration and segmentation method, was trained using 262 pairs of 3T MR scans with weighted segmentation consistency loss. It was tested on same-, cross-, and mixed-domain datasets for contour propagation accuracy and dose accumulation feasibility.

Result: ProRSeg generalized well for bladder registration across domains (DSCs 0.88, 0.87, 0.86). Rectum and CTV performance was domain-dependent. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage and bladder sparing constraints.

Conclusion: ProRSeg demonstrated reasonable multi-domain MR-MR registration performance, with preliminary feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance in prostate cancer MRgART.

Abstract: Background: Accurate deformable image registration (DIR) is required for
contour propagation and dose accumulation in MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy
(MRgART). This study trained and evaluated a deep learning DIR method for
domain invariant MR-MR registration. Methods: A progressively refined
registration and segmentation (ProRSeg) method was trained with 262 pairs of 3T
MR simulation scans from prostate cancer patients using weighted segmentation
consistency loss. ProRSeg was tested on same- (58 pairs), cross- (72 1.5T MR
Linac pairs), and mixed-domain (42 MRSim-MRL pairs) datasets for contour
propagation accuracy of clinical target volume (CTV), bladder, and rectum. Dose
accumulation was performed for 42 patients undergoing 5-fraction MRgART.
Results: ProRSeg demonstrated generalization for bladder with similar Dice
Similarity Coefficients across domains (0.88, 0.87, 0.86). For rectum and CTV,
performance was domain-dependent with higher accuracy on cross-domain MRL
dataset (DSCs 0.89) versus same-domain data. The model's strong cross-domain
performance prompted us to study the feasibility of using it for dose
accumulation. Dose accumulation showed 83.3% of patients met CTV coverage (D95
>= 40.0 Gy) and bladder sparing (D50 <= 20.0 Gy) constraints. All patients
achieved minimum mean target dose (>40.4 Gy), but only 9.5% remained under
upper limit (<42.0 Gy). Conclusions: ProRSeg showed reasonable multi-domain
MR-MR registration performance for prostate cancer patients with preliminary
feasibility for evaluating treatment compliance to clinical constraints.

TL;DR: Percep360 is a novel panoramic generation method for autonomous driving, focusing on coherence and controllability through LSDM and PPM, outperforming traditional stitched images in quality and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires comprehensive 360° views, but current data acquisition is complex and limited. Existing models lack controllability and high-quality generation.

Method: Proposes LSDM for coherent panorama generation via diffusion and PPM for dynamic control cue selection.

Result: Generated images outperform stitched ones in quality metrics and enhance downstream tasks like BEV segmentation.

Conclusion: Percep360 advances panoramic data generation, offering high-quality, controllable outputs for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Panoramic perception holds significant potential for autonomous driving,
enabling vehicles to acquire a comprehensive 360{\deg} surround view in a
single shot. However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete
panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation
pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing
street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration
capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing
datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In
this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for
autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data
with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on
two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the
inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose
the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama
generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps
between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable
generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method
(PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling
controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e.,
no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in
real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data
consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality
metrics and enhances downstream perception models. The source code will be
publicly available at https://github.com/Bryant-Teng/Percep360.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MassID45 dataset for training classifiers to identify and segment insects in bulk samples, combining DNA barcoding and imaging data for ecological and machine learning research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of classifying insects in bulk samples, which is crucial for understanding biodiversity amid population declines.

Method: Combines molecular (DNA barcoding) and imaging data, using human annotators and AI-assisted tools to segment and label over 17,000 specimens.

Result: Created a dataset enabling precise abundance estimates and taxonomic classification of insects in bulk samples.

Conclusion: The MassID45 dataset advances ecological research and machine learning by improving tiny object detection and instance segmentation.

Abstract: Insects comprise millions of species, many experiencing severe population
declines under environmental and habitat changes. High-throughput approaches
are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA
barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic
taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on
individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in
large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample
Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic
classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging
data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual
specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two
tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual
arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining
the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of
bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of
insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection
and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine
learning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeTTA is a training-free test-time adaptation method for vision-language models, improving predictions by modeling test data distribution without costly training or unrealistic assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing domain shifts and distributional changes in VLMs during test-time adaptation, FreeTTA eliminates reliance on costly training or historical data access.

Method: Uses an online EM algorithm with zero-shot VLM predictions as priors to iteratively update test sample probabilities and parameters.

Result: Achieves stable, significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across 15 datasets in cross-domain and out-of-distribution settings.

Conclusion: FreeTTA enhances TTA flexibility by modeling test data distribution and leveraging intrinsic sample relationships, setting a new direction for practical VLM applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image
recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness
in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional
changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data.
Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the
use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample
predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA
methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or
make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and
test data. Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and
universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the
flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model
the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among
test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous
access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages
by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from
VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each
online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA
achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution
settings.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DenoiseCP-Net, a multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception in adverse weather, improving denoising, reducing bandwidth, and maintaining detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated vehicles' perception systems are vulnerable to sensor degradation in adverse weather. Collective perception can help, but its performance in such conditions is understudied.

Method: Proposes DenoiseCP-Net, integrating voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse convolution backbone. Uses a realistic weather-simulated OPV2V dataset.

Result: Achieves near-perfect denoising, reduces bandwidth by 23.6%, maintains detection accuracy, and lowers inference latency.

Conclusion: DenoiseCP-Net effectively addresses adverse weather challenges in collective perception, enhancing performance and efficiency.

Abstract: While automated vehicles hold the potential to significantly reduce traffic
accidents, their perception systems remain vulnerable to sensor degradation
caused by adverse weather and environmental occlusions. Collective perception,
which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to
overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in
adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of
LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present
a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under
adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception
capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due
to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior
to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose
DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective
perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates
voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse
convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with
two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and
computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing
non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating
rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We
demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in
adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while
maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for
cooperative vehicles.

TL;DR: MCA-RG is a knowledge-driven framework for radiology report generation that aligns visual features with medical concepts, improving accuracy and clinical relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in mapping pathological/anatomical features to text descriptions and semantic agnostic feature extraction hinder clinical adoption of LLMs for RRG.

Method: MCA-RG uses pathology and anatomy concept banks, aligns visual features with medical concepts, employs contrastive learning for anatomy, and uses a matching loss for pathology. A feature gating mechanism filters low-quality features.

Result: MCA-RG outperforms benchmarks on MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, demonstrating superior performance in radiology report generation.

Conclusion: MCA-RG effectively enhances radiology report generation by aligning visual features with medical concepts, addressing key clinical challenges.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for
radiology report generation (RRG), clinical adoption remains challenging due to
difficulties in accurately mapping pathological and anatomical features to
their corresponding text descriptions. Additionally, semantic agnostic feature
extraction further hampers the generation of accurate diagnostic reports. To
address these challenges, we introduce Medical Concept Aligned Radiology Report
Generation (MCA-RG), a knowledge-driven framework that explicitly aligns visual
features with distinct medical concepts to enhance the report generation
process. MCA-RG utilizes two curated concept banks: a pathology bank containing
lesion-related knowledge, and an anatomy bank with anatomical descriptions. The
visual features are aligned with these medical concepts and undergo tailored
enhancement. We further propose an anatomy-based contrastive learning procedure
to improve the generalization of anatomical features, coupled with a matching
loss for pathological features to prioritize clinically relevant regions.
Additionally, a feature gating mechanism is employed to filter out low-quality
concept features. Finally, the visual features are corresponding to individual
medical concepts, and are leveraged to guide the report generation process.
Experiments on two public benchmarks (MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus) demonstrate
that MCA-RG achieves superior performance, highlighting its effectiveness in
radiology report generation.

TL;DR: A novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion improves NSCLC survival prediction using 3D CT images and clinical data, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prognosis for NSCLC patients undergoing immunotherapy is crucial for personalized treatment but is hindered by lack of large datasets and effective multi-modal fusion strategies.

Method: A cross-modality masked learning approach combines a Slice-Depth Transformer for 3D CT features and a graph-based Transformer for clinical data, guided by masked modality learning.

Result: The framework achieves superior performance in multi-modal integration for survival prediction, setting a new benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances prognostic accuracy for NSCLC patients, aiding personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Accurate prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing
immunotherapy is essential for personalized treatment planning, enabling
informed patient decisions, and improving both treatment outcomes and quality
of life. However, the lack of large, relevant datasets and effective
multi-modal feature fusion strategies pose significant challenges in this
domain. To address these challenges, we present a large-scale dataset and
introduce a novel framework for multi-modal feature fusion aimed at enhancing
the accuracy of survival prediction. The dataset comprises 3D CT images and
corresponding clinical records from NSCLC patients treated with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), along with progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) data. We further propose a cross-modality masked learning
approach for medical feature fusion, consisting of two distinct branches, each
tailored to its respective modality: a Slice-Depth Transformer for extracting
3D features from CT images and a graph-based Transformer for learning node
features and relationships among clinical variables in tabular data. The fusion
process is guided by a masked modality learning strategy, wherein the model
utilizes the intact modality to reconstruct missing components. This mechanism
improves the integration of modality-specific features, fostering more
effective inter-modality relationships and feature interactions. Our approach
demonstrates superior performance in multi-modal integration for NSCLC survival
prediction, surpassing existing methods and setting a new benchmark for
prognostic models in this context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate cancer diagnosis and treatment rely on microscopic assessment of histopathology images. Current methods struggle with redundant patches and generating automatic captions.

Method: Uses a visual feature extractor, deep embedded clustering for redundancy removal, and a GNN for context. Combines image embeddings with a language model for captioning.

Result: Achieves F1 score of 0.934, AUC of 0.963 for classification, and BLEU-4 of 0.811, METEOR of 0.569 for captioning.

Conclusion: GNN-ViTCap outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing a reliable solution for microscopy-based diagnosis.

Abstract: Microscopic assessment of histopathology images is vital for accurate cancer
diagnosis and treatment. Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning
have become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI
face challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to
subjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology
captions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce
a novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from
histopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor
generates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically
clustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting
representative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph
by connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and
apply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The
aggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space
through a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large
language model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric
datasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for
classification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569
for captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-ViTCap outperforms
state of the art approaches, offering a reliable and efficient solution for
microscopy based patient diagnosis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage digital pathology and deep learning for predicting cellular composition without expensive spatial transcriptomics.

Method: Uses pre-trained pathology foundation models to extract features, then trains a lightweight MLP regressor on cell-type abundances from cell2location.

Result: Accurately predicts cell-type compositions, outperforming existing methods like Hist2Cell with lower computational complexity.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently distills knowledge from foundation models, offering a cost-effective alternative to spatial transcriptomics.

Abstract: The rapid development of digital pathology and modern deep learning has
facilitated the emergence of pathology foundation models that are expected to
solve general pathology problems under various disease conditions in one
unified model, with or without fine-tuning. In parallel, spatial
transcriptomics has emerged as a transformative technology that enables the
profiling of gene expression on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histology
images. Spatial transcriptomics unlocks the unprecedented opportunity to dive
into existing histology images at a more granular, cellular level. In this
work, we propose a lightweight and training-efficient approach to predict
cellular composition directly from H&E-stained histology images by leveraging
information-enriched feature embeddings extracted from pre-trained pathology
foundation models. By training a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
regressor on cell-type abundances derived via cell2location, our method
efficiently distills knowledge from pathology foundation models and
demonstrates the ability to accurately predict cell-type compositions from
histology images, without physically performing the costly spatial
transcriptomics. Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to
existing methods such as Hist2Cell, while significantly reducing computational
complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional distillation methods struggle in cross-modal settings due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage complementary knowledge in teacher models.

Method: Proposes MST-Distill with a diverse ensemble of teacher models, an instance-level routing network, and a plug-in masking module to suppress discrepancies and reconstruct representations.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five multimodal datasets (visual, audio, text).

Conclusion: MST-Distill effectively addresses cross-modal distillation challenges, enhancing knowledge transfer and performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation as an efficient knowledge transfer technique, has
achieved remarkable success in unimodal scenarios. However, in cross-modal
settings, conventional distillation methods encounter significant challenges
due to data and statistical heterogeneities, failing to leverage the
complementary prior knowledge embedded in cross-modal teacher models. This
paper empirically reveals two critical issues in existing approaches:
distillation path selection and knowledge drift. To address these limitations,
we propose MST-Distill, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
featuring a mixture of specialized teachers. Our approach employs a diverse
ensemble of teacher models across both cross-modal and multimodal
configurations, integrated with an instance-level routing network that
facilitates adaptive and dynamic distillation. This architecture effectively
transcends the constraints of traditional methods that rely on monotonous and
static teacher models. Additionally, we introduce a plug-in masking module,
independently trained to suppress modality-specific discrepancies and
reconstruct teacher representations, thereby mitigating knowledge drift and
enhancing transfer effectiveness. Extensive experiments across five diverse
multimodal datasets, spanning visual, audio, and text, demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge
distillation methods in cross-modal distillation tasks. The source code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how contextual metadata (location, time, food items) enhances Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for nutrition analysis, introduces the ACETADA dataset, and shows improved accuracy with metadata integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses on proprietary models like GPT-4, leaving other LMMs underexplored. The impact of contextual metadata and reasoning modifiers on nutrition analysis is also unclear.

Method: The study evaluates eight LMMs (four open-weight, four closed-weight) using the ACETADA dataset. It integrates contextual metadata (GPS, timestamps, food items) and tests reasoning modifiers like Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot.

Result: Metadata integration reduces Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in nutritional predictions. Context-aware LMMs outperform image-only prompting.

Conclusion: Contextual metadata significantly improves LMM performance in nutrition analysis, highlighting the potential of context-aware models.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for
nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary
models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored.
Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its
interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This
work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS
coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into
meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in
estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories,
macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also
introduce ACETADA, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This
open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and
serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs
(four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of
contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images
alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information
enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought,
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona.
Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied
through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted
nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs
for improved nutrition analysis.

TL;DR: A geometric deep learning framework predicts the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) spectrum efficiently from CAD meshes, reducing computation time by 5x compared to FEM while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The FEM method for estimating the LB spectrum is inefficient for large CAD databases or frequent quality control tasks, necessitating a faster solution.

Method: A Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture uses mesh features (e.g., Gaussian curvature, mean curvature) to predict the LB spectrum.

Result: The method reduces computation time by ~5x over FEM with competitive accuracy.

Conclusion: The LB spectrum is learnable, and the proposed GNN framework offers a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: The spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator is central in geometric
deep learning tasks, capturing intrinsic properties of the shape of the object
under consideration. The best established method for its estimation, from a
triangulated mesh of the object, is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM),
and computes the top k LB eigenvalues with a complexity of O(Nk), where N is
the number of points. This can render the FEM method inefficient when
repeatedly applied to databases of CAD mechanical parts, or in quality control
applications where part metrology is acquired as large meshes and decisions
about the quality of each part are needed quickly and frequently. As a solution
to this problem, we present a geometric deep learning framework to predict the
LB spectrum efficiently given the CAD mesh of a part, achieving significant
computational savings without sacrificing accuracy, demonstrating that the LB
spectrum is learnable. The proposed Graph Neural Network architecture uses a
rich set of part mesh features - including Gaussian curvature, mean curvature,
and principal curvatures. In addition to our trained network, we make
available, for repeatability, a large curated dataset of real-world mechanical
CAD models derived from the publicly available ABC dataset used for training
and testing. Experimental results show that our method reduces computation time
of the LB spectrum by approximately 5 times over linear FEM while delivering
competitive accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RulerNet is a deep learning framework for robust real-world scale estimation by reformulating ruler reading as a keypoint-detection problem, using geometric-progression parameters and synthetic data for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pixel-to-real-world dimension conversion is critical for applications like biomedicine, forensics, and e-commerce, but remains a challenge in computer vision.

Method: RulerNet localizes centimeter marks with a distortion-invariant strategy and uses synthetic data for training. DeepGP regresses geometric-progression parameters for real-time efficiency.

Result: RulerNet provides accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under diverse conditions, outperforming traditional methods.

Conclusion: RulerNet is a generalizable tool for automated, scale-aware analysis, with potential for integration in high-impact domains.

Abstract: Accurately converting pixel measurements into absolute real-world dimensions
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and limits progress in key
applications such as biomedicine, forensics, nutritional analysis, and
e-commerce. We introduce RulerNet, a deep learning framework that robustly
infers scale "in the wild" by reformulating ruler reading as a unified
keypoint-detection problem and by representing the ruler with
geometric-progression parameters that are invariant to perspective
transformations. Unlike traditional methods that rely on handcrafted thresholds
or rigid, ruler-specific pipelines, RulerNet directly localizes centimeter
marks using a distortion-invariant annotation and training strategy, enabling
strong generalization across diverse ruler types and imaging conditions while
mitigating data scarcity. We also present a scalable synthetic-data pipeline
that combines graphics-based ruler generation with ControlNet to add
photorealistic context, greatly increasing training diversity and improving
performance. To further enhance robustness and efficiency, we propose DeepGP, a
lightweight feed-forward network that regresses geometric-progression
parameters from noisy marks and eliminates iterative optimization, enabling
real-time scale estimation on mobile or edge devices. Experiments show that
RulerNet delivers accurate, consistent, and efficient scale estimates under
challenging real-world conditions. These results underscore its utility as a
generalizable measurement tool and its potential for integration with other
vision components for automated, scale-aware analysis in high-impact domains. A

### [124] [Evaluating Attribute Confusion in Fashion Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07079)
*Ziyue Liu,Federico Girella,Yiming Wang,Davide Talon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces L-VQAScore, a novel metric for evaluating Text-to-Image (T2I) models, addressing limitations in assessing entity-attribute semantics by combining visual localization and VQA probing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I evaluation methods struggle with attribute confusion and fail to accurately assess rich entity-attribute semantics.

Method: The authors propose a localized human evaluation protocol and L-VQAScore, which integrates visual localization with VQA to probe correct and miss-localized attributes.

Result: L-VQAScore outperforms existing methods in correlating with human judgments on a challenging dataset.

Conclusion: L-VQAScore is a reliable, scalable alternative to subjective evaluations for fine-grained T2I model assessment.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their
evaluation remains challenging in domains like fashion, involving complex
compositional generation. Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage
pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However,
our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich
entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e.,
when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To
address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization
strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual
modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a
novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual
localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized
(leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring
challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms
state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human
judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained
entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and
scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MotionMillion, the largest human motion dataset, and a benchmark for zero-shot motion generation, achieving strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack zero-shot generalization due to small datasets and no comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: Developed an annotation pipeline, created MotionMillion dataset, and proposed MotionMillion-Eval benchmark. Scaled model to 7B parameters.

Result: Demonstrated strong generalization for out-of-domain and complex motions.

Conclusion: Significant progress toward zero-shot human motion generation.

Abstract: Generating diverse and natural human motion sequences based on textual
descriptions constitutes a fundamental and challenging research area within the
domains of computer vision, graphics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements in this field, current methodologies often face challenges
regarding zero-shot generalization capabilities, largely attributable to the
limited size of training datasets. Moreover, the lack of a comprehensive
evaluation framework impedes the advancement of this task by failing to
identify directions for improvement. In this work, we aim to push
text-to-motion into a new era, that is, to achieve the generalization ability
of zero-shot. To this end, firstly, we develop an efficient annotation pipeline
and introduce MotionMillion-the largest human motion dataset to date, featuring
over 2,000 hours and 2 million high-quality motion sequences. Additionally, we
propose MotionMillion-Eval, the most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
zero-shot motion generation. Leveraging a scalable architecture, we scale our
model to 7B parameters and validate its performance on MotionMillion-Eval. Our
results demonstrate strong generalization to out-of-domain and complex
compositional motions, marking a significant step toward zero-shot human motion
generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the VLV auto-encoder framework, leveraging pretrained models to reduce data and cost requirements for training high-quality VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high cost and data demands of training VLMs by strategically using pretrained components.

Method: Uses a vision encoder, T2I diffusion decoder, and LLM, with regularization of language representation space via frozen T2I decoder.

Result: Achieves SoTA captioning comparable to GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash, with training costs under $1,000 USD.

Conclusion: The VLV framework offers a cost-efficient, data-light alternative for building high-performance VLMs.

Abstract: Building state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong
captioning capabilities typically necessitates training on billions of
high-quality image-text pairs, requiring millions of GPU hours. This paper
introduces the Vision-Language-Vision (VLV) auto-encoder framework, which
strategically leverages key pretrained components: a vision encoder, the
decoder of a Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion model, and subsequently, a Large
Language Model (LLM). Specifically, we establish an information bottleneck by
regularizing the language representation space, achieved through freezing the
pretrained T2I diffusion decoder. Our VLV pipeline effectively distills
knowledge from the text-conditioned diffusion model using continuous
embeddings, demonstrating comprehensive semantic understanding via high-quality
reconstructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning a pretrained LLM to decode the
intermediate language representations into detailed descriptions, we construct
a state-of-the-art (SoTA) captioner comparable to leading models like GPT-4o
and Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our method demonstrates exceptional cost-efficiency and
significantly reduces data requirements; by primarily utilizing single-modal
images for training and maximizing the utility of existing pretrained models
(image encoder, T2I diffusion model, and LLM), it circumvents the need for
massive paired image-text datasets, keeping the total training expenditure
under $1,000 USD.

TL;DR: 4KAgent is a unified system for upscaling any image to 4K resolution, handling severe degradations and enhancing facial details, outperforming benchmarks across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a universal, high-quality image upscaling system that addresses severe degradations and diverse use cases, advancing low-level vision tasks.

Method: Combines Profiling, Perception Agent (vision-language models), and Restoration Agent (recursive execution-reflection) with a quality-driven policy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 26 benchmarks in various domains, excelling in perceptual and fidelity metrics.

Conclusion: 4KAgent introduces an agentic paradigm for low-level vision, encouraging innovation in vision-centric autonomous agents.

Abstract: We present 4KAgent, a unified agentic super-resolution generalist system
designed to universally upscale any image to 4K resolution (and even higher, if
applied iteratively). Our system can transform images from extremely low
resolutions with severe degradations, for example, highly distorted inputs at
256x256, into crystal-clear, photorealistic 4K outputs. 4KAgent comprises three
core components: (1) Profiling, a module that customizes the 4KAgent pipeline
based on bespoke use cases; (2) A Perception Agent, which leverages
vision-language models alongside image quality assessment experts to analyze
the input image and make a tailored restoration plan; and (3) A Restoration
Agent, which executes the plan, following a recursive execution-reflection
paradigm, guided by a quality-driven mixture-of-expert policy to select the
optimal output for each step. Additionally, 4KAgent embeds a specialized face
restoration pipeline, significantly enhancing facial details in portrait and
selfie photos. We rigorously evaluate our 4KAgent across 11 distinct task
categories encompassing a total of 26 diverse benchmarks, setting new
state-of-the-art on a broad spectrum of imaging domains. Our evaluations cover
natural images, portrait photos, AI-generated content, satellite imagery,
fluorescence microscopy, and medical imaging like fundoscopy, ultrasound, and
X-ray, demonstrating superior performance in terms of both perceptual (e.g.,
NIQE, MUSIQ) and fidelity (e.g., PSNR) metrics. By establishing a novel agentic
paradigm for low-level vision tasks, we aim to catalyze broader interest and
innovation within vision-centric autonomous agents across diverse research
communities. We will release all the code, models, and results at:

*Vatsal Agarwal,Matthew Gwilliam,Gefen Kohavi,Eshan Verma,Daniel Ulbricht,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models as visual encoders for MLLMs, addressing CLIP's limitations in fine-grained detail capture. It identifies diffusion features' semantic richness and alignment, proposes a mitigation for LLM leakage, and demonstrates improved performance in vision-centric tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's inability to capture fine-grained details in image-based question-answering motivates the use of diffusion models as visual encoders for richer semantics and better alignment.

Method: The study analyzes diffusion models' internal representations, leverages text conditioning for question relevance, investigates LLM leakage, and proposes a fusion strategy combining CLIP and diffusion features.

Result: Diffusion models show promise for visual understanding, especially in tasks requiring spatial and compositional reasoning, outperforming CLIP in benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can effectively serve as instruction-aware visual encoders, enhancing MLLMs' capabilities in vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the
use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global
information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the
input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware
visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find
diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text
alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus
the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to
align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage
phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the
original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a
mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion
strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We
evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks,
demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding,
particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional
reasoning. Our project page can be found

*Weronika Hryniewska-Guzik,Przemyslaw Biecek*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'polyrepresentation,' a method combining multiple data representations for better machine learning performance, demonstrated on X-ray images and transferable to other domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of extracting meaningful features for machine learning performance and the need for generalizable, effective data representation.

Method: Polyrepresentation integrates multiple representations (e.g., Siamese Network embeddings, self-supervised models, radiomic features) from distinct sources.

Result: Improved performance metrics and demonstrated transferability to smaller datasets, highlighting resource efficiency.

Conclusion: Polyrepresentation is versatile, with broad potential impact beyond medical data, applicable to various domains.

Abstract: The success of machine learning algorithms is inherently related to the
extraction of meaningful features, as they play a pivotal role in the
performance of these algorithms. Central to this challenge is the quality of
data representation. However, the ability to generalize and extract these
features effectively from unseen datasets is also crucial. In light of this, we
introduce a novel concept: the polyrepresentation. Polyrepresentation
integrates multiple representations of the same modality extracted from
distinct sources, for example, vector embeddings from the Siamese Network,
self-supervised models, and interpretable radiomic features. This approach
yields better performance metrics compared to relying on a single
representation. Additionally, in the context of X-ray images, we demonstrate
the transferability of the created polyrepresentation to a smaller dataset,
underscoring its potential as a pragmatic and resource-efficient approach in
various image-related solutions. It is worth noting that the concept of
polyprepresentation on the example of medical data can also be applied to other
domains, showcasing its versatility and broad potential impact.

TL;DR: HoME, a hierarchical token-routing model for 3D medical image segmentation, improves efficiency and performance by combining local and global expert routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in 3D medical image segmentation, such as diverse modalities and data variability, requires efficient long-context modeling.

Method: HoME uses a two-level token-routing layer: a local SMoE for feature extraction and a global SMoE for context refinement, built on the Mamba SSM backbone.

Result: HoME achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D medical imaging datasets.

Conclusion: The hierarchical design of HoME enhances generalizability and segmentation accuracy, making it effective for 3D medical image processing.

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has significantly advanced medical
image segmentation. However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical
image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In
this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a
two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically
designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space
model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse,
adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts
(SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to
specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second
stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group
information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design,
combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves
generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art
results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging
modalities and data quality.

TL;DR: CCELLA++ extends CCELLA to generate synthetic biparametric prostate MRI (bpMRI) and improves domain adaptation for prostate cancer detection, outperforming real data in classifier performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CCELLA, such as single-sequence focus (AxT2), lack of domain shift investigation, and radiology prioritization, to enhance clinical utility.

Method: Expands CCELLA for bpMRI generation (AxT2, HighB, ADC), investigates domain adaptation via pretraining on synthetic/real data, and fine-tuning on external datasets.

Result: Improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC, outperformed real bpMRI in classifier performance (AP, AUC) across domain adaptation scenarios, especially with limited external data.

Conclusion: CCELLA++ synthetic bpMRI enhances classifier generalization and performance, suggesting future work on quality quantification, multi-sequence training balance, and additional LDM conditioning.

Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) could mitigate data scarcity
challenges affecting machine learning development for medical image
interpretation. The recent CCELLA LDM improved prostate cancer detection
performance using synthetic MRI for classifier training but was limited to the
axial T2-weighted (AxT2) sequence, did not investigate inter-institutional
domain shift, and prioritized radiology over histopathology outcomes. We
propose CCELLA++ to address these limitations and improve clinical utility.
Methods: CCELLA++ expands CCELLA for simultaneous biparametric prostate MRI
(bpMRI) generation, including the AxT2, high b-value diffusion series (HighB)
and apparent diffusion coefficient map (ADC). Domain adaptation was
investigated by pretraining classifiers on real or LDM-generated synthetic data
from an internal institution, followed with fine-tuning on progressively
smaller fractions of an out-of-distribution, external dataset. Results:
CCELLA++ improved 3D FID for HighB and ADC but not AxT2 (0.013, 0.012, 0.063
respectively) sequences compared to CCELLA (0.060). Classifier pretraining with
CCELLA++ bpMRI outperformed real bpMRI in AP and AUC for all domain adaptation
scenarios. CCELLA++ pretraining achieved highest classifier performance below
50% (n=665) external dataset volume. Conclusion: Synthetic bpMRI generated by
our method can improve downstream classifier generalization and performance
beyond real bpMRI or CCELLA-generated AxT2-only images. Future work should seek
to quantify medical image sample quality, balance multi-sequence LDM training,
and condition the LDM with additional information. Significance: The proposed
CCELLA++ LDM can generate synthetic bpMRI that outperforms real data for domain
adaptation with a limited target institution dataset. Our code is available at

Motivation: High breast density is a risk factor for cancer and complicates tumor detection, necessitating standardized assessment.

Method: Four CNNs (ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet121) with channel attention were compared. A novel Combined Focal Label Smoothing Loss addressed class imbalance. Preprocessing included CLAHE and data augmentation. An ensemble voting approach was used.

Result: The system achieved AUC: 0.963 and F1-score: 0.952, outperforming individual models.

Conclusion: The system shows promise for standardizing breast density assessments, improving screening efficiency, and reducing variability among radiologists.

Abstract: Breast density assessment is a crucial component of mammographic
interpretation, with high breast density (BI-RADS categories C and D)
representing both a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer and a
technical challenge for tumor detection. This study proposes an automated deep
learning system for robust binary classification of breast density (low: A/B
vs. high: C/D) using the VinDr-Mammo dataset. We implemented and compared four
advanced convolutional neural networks: ResNet18, ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0,
and DenseNet121, each enhanced with channel attention mechanisms. To address
the inherent class imbalance, we developed a novel Combined Focal Label
Smoothing Loss function that integrates focal loss, label smoothing, and
class-balanced weighting. Our preprocessing pipeline incorporated advanced
techniques, including contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE)
and comprehensive data augmentation. The individual models were combined
through an optimized ensemble voting approach, achieving superior performance
(AUC: 0.963, F1-score: 0.952) compared to any single model. This system
demonstrates significant potential to standardize density assessments in
clinical practice, potentially improving screening efficiency and early cancer
detection rates while reducing inter-observer variability among radiologists.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: TfeNet, a novel tubular feature extraction network, improves airway segmentation in CT images using direction-aware convolution and a tubular feature fusion module, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual airway annotation in CT images is time-consuming and expertise-dependent, necessitating automatic segmentation for clinical applications like bronchoscopic navigation.

Method: TfeNet introduces direction-aware convolution and a tubular feature fusion module (TFFM) to better capture fine airway structures.

Result: TfeNet achieves 94.95% accuracy on the ATM22 dataset and performs well on the AIIB23 dataset, surpassing existing methods.

Conclusion: TfeNet offers a robust solution for accurate and continuous airway segmentation, advancing clinical applications.

Abstract: Manual annotation of airway regions in computed tomography images is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task. Automatic airway segmentation is
therefore a prerequisite for enabling rapid bronchoscopic navigation and the
clinical deployment of bronchoscopic robotic systems. Although convolutional
neural network methods have gained considerable attention in airway
segmentation, the unique tree-like structure of airways poses challenges for
conventional and deformable convolutions, which often fail to focus on fine
airway structures, leading to missed segments and discontinuities. To address
this issue, this study proposes a novel tubular feature extraction network,
named TfeNet. TfeNet introduces a novel direction-aware convolution operation
that first applies spatial rotation transformations to adjust the sampling
positions of linear convolution kernels. The deformed kernels are then
represented as line segments or polylines in 3D space. Furthermore, a tubular
feature fusion module (TFFM) is designed based on asymmetric convolution and
residual connection strategies, enhancing the network's focus on subtle airway
structures. Extensive experiments conducted on one public dataset and two
datasets used in airway segmentation challenges demonstrate that the proposed
TfeNet achieves more accuracy and continuous airway structure predictions
compared with existing methods. In particular, TfeNet achieves the highest
overall score of 94.95% on the current largest airway segmentation dataset,
Airway Tree Modeling(ATM22), and demonstrates advanced performance on the lung
fibrosis dataset(AIIB23). The code is available at

Conclusion: FEI is a superior, efficient alternative to standard Equivariant Imaging for unsupervised deep imaging.

Abstract: We propose Fast Equivariant Imaging (FEI), a novel unsupervised learning
framework to efficiently train deep imaging networks without ground-truth data.
From the perspective of reformulating the Equivariant Imaging based
optimization problem via the method of Lagrange multipliers and utilizing
plug-and-play denoisers, this novel unsupervised scheme shows superior
efficiency and performance compared to vanilla Equivariant Imaging paradigm. In
particular, our PnP-FEI scheme achieves an order-of-magnitude (10x)
acceleration over standard EI on training U-Net with CT100 dataset for X-ray CT
reconstruction, with improved generalization performance.

### [137] [Speckle2Self: Self-Supervised Ultrasound Speckle Reduction Without Clean Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06828)
*Xuesong Li,Nassir Navab,Zhongliang Jiang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Speckle2Self is a self-supervised algorithm for denoising medical ultrasound images by leveraging multi-scale perturbations to isolate speckle noise while preserving anatomical structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speckle noise in ultrasound imaging is tissue-dependent and not purely random, making traditional denoising methods ineffective. Existing approaches like Noise2Noise and blind-spot networks fail due to the noise's unique properties.

Method: Speckle2Self uses multi-scale perturbation (MSP) to introduce tissue-dependent variations in speckle patterns, modeling the clean image as low-rank and isolating noise as sparse.

Result: The method outperforms conventional filters and state-of-the-art learning-based techniques on simulated and real human carotid ultrasound images, demonstrating strong generalization across different US machines.

Conclusion: Speckle2Self effectively addresses the challenges of ultrasound speckle noise with a self-supervised approach, offering practical improvements for medical imaging.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in
medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades
image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to
substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot
be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,
US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body
microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that
obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by
pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also
cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address
this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm
for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is
that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces
tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,
while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective
speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and
isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,
Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based
denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic
simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from
multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and
adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be
released upon acceptance.

*Kaveh Moradkhani,R Jarrett Rushmore,Sylvain Bouix*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SimCortex is a deep learning framework for reconstructing cortical surfaces from MRI data, ensuring topological correctness and reducing surface defects like overlaps and self-intersections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for cortical surface reconstruction often produce surfaces with topological defects and inaccuracies, necessitating a more reliable solution.

Method: SimCortex segments T1w MRI into tissue labels, generates initial meshes, and applies multiscale diffeomorphic deformations using stationary velocity fields for smooth, topology-preserving transformations.

Result: SimCortex significantly reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections while maintaining high geometric accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: SimCortex offers a robust solution for accurate cortical surface reconstruction, addressing key limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Accurate cortical surface reconstruction from magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) data is crucial for reliable neuroanatomical analyses. Current methods
have to contend with complex cortical geometries, strict topological
requirements, and often produce surfaces with overlaps, self-intersections, and
topological defects. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce SimCortex, a
deep learning framework that simultaneously reconstructs all brain surfaces
(left/right white-matter and pial) from T1-weighted(T1w) MRI volumes while
preserving topological properties. Our method first segments the T1w image into
a nine-class tissue label map. From these segmentations, we generate
subject-specific, collision-free initial surface meshes. These surfaces serve
as precise initializations for subsequent multiscale diffeomorphic
deformations. Employing stationary velocity fields (SVFs) integrated via
scaling-and-squaring, our approach ensures smooth, topology-preserving
transformations with significantly reduced surface collisions and
self-intersections. Evaluations on standard datasets demonstrate that SimCortex
dramatically reduces surface overlaps and self-intersections, surpassing
current methods while maintaining state-of-the-art geometric accuracy.

*Daniel Onah,Ravish Desai*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep Brain Net combines EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50 with transfer learning for efficient and accurate brain tumor detection from MRI images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency in automated brain tumor detection using deep learning.

Method: Integrates EfficientNetB0 (for efficiency) and ResNet50 (for accuracy) with transfer learning, leveraging their strengths for improved performance.

Result: Achieves 88% accuracy, 88.75% weighted F1 score, and 98.17% macro AUC ROC, demonstrating superior performance.

Conclusion: Deep Brain Net is robust and clinically promising for assisting radiologists in brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown great promise in the automated
detection and classification of brain tumors from MRI images. However,
achieving high accuracy and computational efficiency remains a challenge. In
this research, we propose Deep Brain Net, a novel deep learning system designed
to optimize performance in the detection of brain tumors. The model integrates
the strengths of two advanced neural network architectures which are
EfficientNetB0 and ResNet50, combined with transfer learning to improve
generalization and reduce training time. The EfficientNetB0 architecture
enhances model efficiency by utilizing mobile inverted bottleneck blocks, which
incorporate depth wise separable convolutions. This design significantly
reduces the number of parameters and computational cost while preserving the
ability of models to learn complex feature representations. The ResNet50
architecture, pre trained on large scale datasets like ImageNet, is fine tuned
for brain tumor classification. Its use of residual connections allows for
training deeper networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and
avoiding performance degradation. The integration of these components ensures
that the proposed system is both computationally efficient and highly accurate.
Extensive experiments performed on publicly available MRI datasets demonstrate
that Deep Brain Net consistently outperforms existing state of the art methods
in terms of classification accuracy, precision, recall, and computational
efficiency. The result is an accuracy of 88 percent, a weighted F1 score of
88.75 percent, and a macro AUC ROC score of 98.17 percent which demonstrates
the robustness and clinical potential of Deep Brain Net in assisting
radiologists with brain tumor diagnosis.

### [140] [Can Interpretation Predict Behavior on Unseen Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06445)
*Victoria R. Li,Jenny Kaufmann,Martin Wattenberg,David Alvarez-Melis,Naomi Saphra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretability tools can predict out-of-distribution (OOD) model behavior, with hierarchical attention patterns indicating hierarchical generalization, even if not directly implemented.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether interpretability methods can predict unseen model behavior, specifically OOD generalization, beyond just explaining interventions.

Method: Analyze attention patterns in hundreds of Transformer models trained on a synthetic task, correlating these patterns with OOD generalization rules.

Result: Hierarchical attention patterns predict hierarchical OOD generalization, even without direct implementation.

Conclusion: Interpretability tools show promise for predicting unseen model behavior, motivating further research in this direction.

Abstract: Interpretability research often aims to predict how a model will respond to
targeted interventions on specific mechanisms. However, it rarely predicts how
a model will respond to unseen input data. This paper explores the promises and
challenges of interpretability as a tool for predicting out-of-distribution
(OOD) model behavior. Specifically, we investigate the correspondence between
attention patterns and OOD generalization in hundreds of Transformer models
independently trained on a synthetic classification task. These models exhibit
several distinct systematic generalization rules OOD, forming a diverse
population for correlational analysis. In this setting, we find that simple
observational tools from interpretability can predict OOD performance. In
particular, when in-distribution attention exhibits hierarchical patterns, the
model is likely to generalize hierarchically on OOD data -- even when the
rule's implementation does not rely on these hierarchical patterns, according
to ablation tests. Our findings offer a proof-of-concept to motivate further
interpretability work on predicting unseen model behavior.

*Jing Liang,Hongyao Tang,Yi Ma,Jinyi Liu,Yan Zheng,Shuyue Hu,Lei Bai,Jianye Hao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReMix introduces off-policy RL to enhance Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) for LLMs, reducing training costs by 30x-450x while achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RFT methods are on-policy, wasting past data and increasing compute/time costs. ReMix aims to leverage off-policy data for efficiency.

Method: ReMix combines mix-policy proximal policy gradient, KL-Convex policy constraint, and policy reincarnation for stable, flexible, and efficient training.

Result: Achieves 52.10%-64.39% Pass@1 accuracy on math benchmarks with significantly reduced training data (0.007M-0.079M rollouts).

Conclusion: ReMix is a cost-effective, high-performance off-policy RFT method, revealing insights like the Whipping Effect and self-reflection collapse.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the
reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most
existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL
in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully
utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time,
posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To
this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating
Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable
on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix
consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient
with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2)
KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and
flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from
efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our
experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base
models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with
0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B
model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math
reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and
MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level
performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of
rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via
multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses
due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of
self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.

*Habibur Rahaman,Atri Chatterjee,Swarup Bhunia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WINGs is a framework that dynamically generates and compresses neural network weights, reducing memory usage without significant accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high memory requirements of neural networks, especially for resource-constrained edge applications.

Method: Uses PCA for dimensionality reduction and SVR models to predict weights in FC networks, and sensitivity-aware compression for CNNs.

Result: Achieves 53x compression for FC layers, 28x for AlexNet (MNIST), and 18x for AlexNet (CIFAR-10) with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: WINGs offers a memory-efficient, secure, and high-throughput solution for DNN inference on edge devices.

Abstract: Complex neural networks require substantial memory to store a large number of
synaptic weights. This work introduces WINGs (Automatic Weight Generator for
Secure and Storage-Efficient Deep Learning Models), a novel framework that
dynamically generates layer weights in a fully connected neural network (FC)
and compresses the weights in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) during
inference, significantly reducing memory requirements without sacrificing
accuracy. WINGs framework uses principal component analysis (PCA) for
dimensionality reduction and lightweight support vector regression (SVR) models
to predict layer weights in the FC networks, removing the need for storing
full-weight matrices and achieving substantial memory savings. It also
preferentially compresses the weights in low-sensitivity layers of CNNs using
PCA and SVR with sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity-aware design also offers
an added level of security, as any bit-flip attack with weights in compressed
layers has an amplified and readily detectable effect on accuracy. WINGs
achieves 53x compression for the FC layers and 28x for AlexNet with MNIST
dataset, and 18x for Alexnet with CIFAR-10 dataset with 1-2% accuracy loss.
This significant reduction in memory results in higher throughput and lower
energy for DNN inference, making it attractive for resource-constrained edge
applications.

*Anshuk Uppal,Yuhta Takida,Chieh-Hsin Lai,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel framework balances disentangled latent representations and high-quality generation by using a range of β values in a VAE, enhanced by a diffusion model for smooth transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between disentangled, interpretable latent representations and high-quality reconstructions in generative models.

Method: Train a single VAE with a new loss function for multiple β values, then use a non-linear diffusion model to transition between representations.

Result: Achieves sharp reconstructions and disentangled representations, with smooth latent space transitions and standalone generative capability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully balances disentanglement and generation quality, enabling flexible and high-fidelity outputs.

Abstract: Disentangled and interpretable latent representations in generative models
typically come at the cost of generation quality. The $\beta$-VAE framework
introduces a hyperparameter $\beta$ to balance disentanglement and
reconstruction quality, where setting $\beta > 1$ introduces an information
bottleneck that favors disentanglement over sharp, accurate reconstructions. To
address this trade-off, we propose a novel generative modeling framework that
leverages a range of $\beta$ values to learn multiple corresponding latent
representations. First, we obtain a slew of representations by training a
single variational autoencoder (VAE), with a new loss function that controls
the information retained in each latent representation such that the higher
$\beta$ value prioritize disentanglement over reconstruction fidelity. We then,
introduce a non-linear diffusion model that smoothly transitions latent
representations corresponding to different $\beta$ values. This model denoises
towards less disentangled and more informative representations, ultimately
leading to (almost) lossless representations, enabling sharp reconstructions.
Furthermore, our model supports sample generation without input images,
functioning as a standalone generative model. We evaluate our framework in
terms of both disentanglement and generation quality. Additionally, we observe
smooth transitions in the latent spaces with respect to changes in $\beta$,
facilitating consistent manipulation of generated outputs.

### [144] [A Principled Framework for Multi-View Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06979)
*Panagiotis Koromilas,Efthymios Georgiou,Giorgos Bouritsas,Theodoros Giannakopoulos,Mihalis A. Nicolaou,Yannis Panagakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces two novel loss functions, MV-InfoNCE and MV-DHEL, to address limitations in multi-view contrastive learning, improving performance and scalability with increasing view multiplicity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current contrastive learning methods handle multiple views suboptimally, leading to conflicting objectives, limited interactions, and alignment-uniformity coupling. The goal is to overcome these issues and realize the benefits of increased view multiplicity.

Method: Proposes MV-InfoNCE (extending InfoNCE to incorporate all view interactions) and MV-DHEL (decoupling alignment from uniformity). Both are theoretically grounded and empirically validated.

Result: Outperforms existing multi-view approaches on ImageNet1K and other datasets, scales with view multiplicity, and mitigates dimensionality collapse with five or more views.

Conclusion: The proposed methods effectively address limitations of multi-view contrastive learning, demonstrating superior performance and scalability, even in multimodal settings.

Abstract: Contrastive Learning (CL), a leading paradigm in Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL), typically relies on pairs of data views generated through augmentation.
While multiple augmentations per instance (more than two) improve
generalization in supervised learning, current CL methods handle additional
views suboptimally by simply aggregating different pairwise objectives. This
approach suffers from four critical limitations: (L1) it utilizes multiple
optimization terms per data point resulting to conflicting objectives, (L2) it
fails to model all interactions across views and data points, (L3) it inherits
fundamental limitations (e.g. alignment-uniformity coupling) from pairwise CL
losses, and (L4) it prevents fully realizing the benefits of increased view
multiplicity observed in supervised settings. We address these limitations
through two novel loss functions: MV-InfoNCE, which extends InfoNCE to
incorporate all possible view interactions simultaneously in one term per data
point, and MV-DHEL, which decouples alignment from uniformity across views
while scaling interaction complexity with view multiplicity. Both approaches
are theoretically grounded - we prove they asymptotically optimize for
alignment of all views and uniformity, providing principled extensions to
multi-view contrastive learning. Our empirical results on ImageNet1K and three
other datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing
multi-view approaches and effectively scale with increasing view multiplicity.
We also apply our objectives to multimodal data and show that, in contrast to
other contrastive objectives, they can scale beyond just two modalities. Most
significantly, ablation studies reveal that MV-DHEL with five or more views
effectively mitigates dimensionality collapse by fully utilizing the embedding
space, thereby delivering multi-view benefits observed in supervised learning.

*Lan Li,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts (DCE) framework to address intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain shifts in Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DIL struggles with imbalanced data, causing underfitting of few-shot classes and difficulty in maintaining many-shot class knowledge across domains.

Method: DCE uses frequency-aware experts and a dynamic expert selector with balanced Gaussian sampling to balance learning across classes and domains.

Result: DCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DCE effectively tackles DIL challenges by balancing intra-domain and cross-domain learning, improving model adaptability and performance.

Abstract: Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) focuses on continual learning in
non-stationary environments, requiring models to adjust to evolving domains
while preserving historical knowledge. DIL faces two critical challenges in the
context of imbalanced data: intra-domain class imbalance and cross-domain class
distribution shifts. These challenges significantly hinder model performance,
as intra-domain imbalance leads to underfitting of few-shot classes, while
cross-domain shifts require maintaining well-learned many-shot classes and
transferring knowledge to improve few-shot class performance in old domains. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Dual-Balance Collaborative Experts
(DCE) framework. DCE employs a frequency-aware expert group, where each expert
is guided by specialized loss functions to learn features for specific
frequency groups, effectively addressing intra-domain class imbalance.
Subsequently, a dynamic expert selector is learned by synthesizing
pseudo-features through balanced Gaussian sampling from historical class
statistics. This mechanism navigates the trade-off between preserving many-shot
knowledge of previous domains and leveraging new data to improve few-shot class
performance in earlier tasks. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark
datasets demonstrate DCE's state-of-the-art performance.

*Saierdaer Yusuyin,Te Ma,Hao Huang,Zhijian Ou*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper proposes a latent variable model (JSA-SPG) to eliminate the need for pronunciation lexicons in crosslingual speech recognition, achieving significant error rate reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phoneme-based crosslingual speech recognition requires pronunciation lexicons, which limits practicality. The study aims to remove this dependency.

Method: A latent variable model (JSA-SPG) is introduced, combining speech-to-phoneme (S2P), phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G), and grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) models, trained jointly using the JSA algorithm.

Result: JSA-SPG reduces error rates by 5% compared to subword or full phoneme supervision and by 9% in language domain adaptation.

Conclusion: The method effectively eliminates lexicon dependency and improves performance, with open-sourced code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained models with phonetic supervision have demonstrated
their advantages for crosslingual speech recognition in data efficiency and
information sharing across languages. However, a limitation is that a
pronunciation lexicon is needed for such phoneme-based crosslingual speech
recognition. In this study, we aim to eliminate the need for pronunciation
lexicons and propose a latent variable model based method, with phonemes being
treated as discrete latent variables. The new method consists of a
speech-to-phoneme (S2P) model and a phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) model, and a
grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model is introduced as an auxiliary inference model.
To jointly train the three models, we utilize the joint stochastic
approximation (JSA) algorithm, which is a stochastic extension of the EM
(expectation-maximization) algorithm and has demonstrated superior performance
particularly in estimating discrete latent variable models. Based on the
Whistle multilingual pre-trained S2P model, crosslingual experiments are
conducted in Polish (130 h) and Indonesian (20 h). With only 10 minutes of
phoneme supervision, the new method, JSA-SPG, achieves 5\% error rate
reductions compared to the best crosslingual fine-tuning approach using subword
or full phoneme supervision. Furthermore, it is found that in language domain
adaptation (i.e., utilizing cross-domain text-only data), JSA-SPG outperforms
the standard practice of language model fusion via the auxiliary support of the
G2P model by 9% error rate reductions. To facilitate reproducibility and
encourage further exploration in this field, we open-source the JSA-SPG
training code and complete pipeline.

TL;DR: The paper explores the vocal aspects of 'kawaii' (Japanese cuteness), identifying key voice elements and manipulation methods for computer voices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research focused on visual aspects of kawaii, leaving vocal elements unexplored. This study aims to formalize kawaii vocalics.

Method: A four-phase study (N=512) with text-to-speech and game character voices, manipulating fundamental and formant frequencies.

Result: Found kawaii 'sweet spots' in voice manipulation, with limitations and a ceiling effect for certain voices.

Conclusion: Provides empirical validation of a kawaii vocalics model and a basic method for manipulating kawaii perceptions in computer voices.

Abstract: "Kawaii" is the Japanese concept of cute, which carries sociocultural
connotations related to social identities and emotional responses. Yet,
virtually all work to date has focused on the visual side of kawaii, including
in studies of computer agents and social robots. In pursuit of formalizing the
new science of kawaii vocalics, we explored what elements of voice relate to
kawaii and how they might be manipulated, manually and automatically. We
conducted a four-phase study (grand N = 512) with two varieties of computer
voices: text-to-speech (TTS) and game character voices. We found kawaii "sweet
spots" through manipulation of fundamental and formant frequencies, but only
for certain voices and to a certain extent. Findings also suggest a ceiling
effect for the kawaii vocalics of certain voices. We offer empirical validation
of the preliminary kawaii vocalics model and an elementary method for
manipulating kawaii perceptions of computer voice.

Motivation: To explore how stylized, voiced agents influence user interaction in a multimodal language learning setting, focusing on engagement, usability, and emotional responses.

Method: Mixed-methods evaluation with 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters using large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis in Japanese.

Result: Agent design (voice, persona, linguistic style) strongly affected user experience, motivation, and learning strategies, varying by proficiency and cultural background.

Conclusion: Stylized agents enhance engagement and social responsiveness in human-agent interaction, providing design insights for more effective systems.

Abstract: This study investigates how stylized, voiced agents shape user interaction in
a multimodal language learning environment. We conducted a mixed-methods
evaluation of 54 participants interacting with anime-inspired characters
powered by large language models and expressive text-to-speech synthesis. These
agents responded in Japanese character language, offering users asynchronous,
semi-structured conversation in varying speech styles and emotional tones. We
analyzed user engagement patterns, perceived usability, emotional responses,
and learning behaviors, with particular attention to how agent stylization
influenced interaction across language proficiency levels and cultural
backgrounds. Our findings reveal that agent design, especially voice, persona,
and linguistic style, substantially affected user experience, motivation, and
strategy. This work contributes to the understanding of affective, culturally
stylized agents in human-agent interaction and offers guidance for designing

TL;DR: The paper discusses the need for civil society organizations (CSOs) to co-develop AI-assisted tools for monitoring harmful online content, highlighting gaps in current open-source solutions and collaborations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Platforms are reducing content moderation efforts, making CSOs' role vital. Existing tools lack integration and practical usability for CSOs.

Method: Collaborative development of an open-source AI tool for monitoring anti-democratic movements on Telegram, involving CSOs as active partners.

Result: The work is in progress, aiming to bridge the gap between research and practical tools for CSOs.

Conclusion: CSOs should co-develop AI tools to ensure alignment with stakeholder needs, fostering better collaboration between academia, open-source communities, and civil society.

Abstract: The role of civil society organizations (CSOs) in monitoring harmful online
content is increasingly crucial, especially as platform providers reduce their
investment in content moderation. AI tools can assist in detecting and
monitoring harmful content at scale. However, few open-source tools offer
seamless integration of AI models and social media monitoring infrastructures.
Given their thematic expertise and contextual understanding of harmful content,
CSOs should be active partners in co-developing technological tools, providing
feedback, helping to improve models, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder
needs and values, rather than as passive 'consumers'. However, collaborations
between the open source community, academia, and civil society remain rare, and
research on harmful content seldom translates into practical tools usable by
civil society actors. This work in progress explores how CSOs can be
meaningfully involved in an AI-assisted open-source monitoring tool of
anti-democratic movements on Telegram, which we are currently developing in
collaboration with CSO stakeholders.

*Li Du,Hanyu Zhao,Yiming Ju,Tengfei Pan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a systematic framework for constructing high-quality instruction datasets to improve model performance, addressing limitations in coverage and depth of existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current instruction datasets lack sufficient coverage and depth, limiting model performance on complex tasks and rare domains.

Method: The framework includes a hierarchical labeling system, seed selection, evolutionary data synthesis, and model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation.

Result: The constructed dataset, InfinityInstruct-Subject (~1.5M instructions), improves instruction-following capabilities in experiments.

Conclusion: The work provides a foundation for evolving instruction datasets from quantity to quality, enhancing model generalizability.

Abstract: Instruction tuning has become a foundation for unlocking the capabilities of
large-scale pretrained models and improving their performance on complex tasks.
Thus, the construction of high-quality instruction datasets is crucial for
enhancing model performance and generalizability. Although current instruction
datasets have reached tens of millions of samples, models finetuned on them may
still struggle with complex instruction following and tasks in rare domains.
This is primarily due to limited expansion in both ``coverage'' (coverage of
task types and knowledge areas) and ``depth'' (instruction complexity) of the
instruction set. To address this issue, we propose a systematic instruction
data construction framework, which integrates a hierarchical labeling system,
an informative seed selection algorithm, an evolutionary data synthesis
process, and a model deficiency diagnosis with targeted data generation. These
components form an iterative closed-loop to continuously enhance the coverage
and depth of instruction data. Based on this framework, we construct
InfinityInstruct-Subject, a high-quality dataset containing ~1.5 million
instructions. Experiments on multiple foundation models and benchmark tasks
demonstrate its effectiveness in improving instruction-following capabilities.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a system with three cooperative agents to address gaps in traditional travel-planning systems, improving query interpretation, navigation, and disruption resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional travel-planning systems are static and fragmented, failing to handle real-world complexities like evolving conditions and disruptions.

Method: Three agents are introduced: a Travel Planning Agent for multi-modal queries, a Destination Assistant Agent for fine-grained navigation, and a Local Discovery Agent for disruption response using image embeddings and RAG.

Result: The system shows significant improvements in query interpretation, navigation accuracy, and disruption resilience.

Conclusion: The proposed system holds promise for applications ranging from urban exploration to emergency response.

Abstract: Traditional travel-planning systems are often static and fragmented, leaving
them ill-equipped to handle real-world complexities such as evolving
environmental conditions and unexpected itinerary disruptions. In this paper,
we identify three gaps between existing service providers causing frustrating
user experience: intelligent trip planning, precision "last-100-meter"
navigation, and dynamic itinerary adaptation. We propose three cooperative
agents: a Travel Planning Agent that employs grid-based spatial grounding and
map analysis to help resolve complex multi-modal user queries; a Destination
Assistant Agent that provides fine-grained guidance for the final navigation
leg of each journey; and a Local Discovery Agent that leverages image
embeddings and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to detect and respond to
trip plan disruptions. With evaluations and experiments, our system
demonstrates substantial improvements in query interpretation, navigation
accuracy, and disruption resilience, underscoring its promise for applications
from urban exploration to emergency response.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a framework (NeME) to evaluate Imitation Learning methods by analyzing robot trajectories, reducing human involvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in evaluating humanoid robot performance due to irreproducible success rates and complex movement trajectories in HRIC.

Method: Develops Neural Meta Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model to classify actions from trajectories for policy comparison.

Result: Validated on ergoCub, NeME aligns better with robot success rates than baselines, offering reproducible evaluation.

Conclusion: NeME provides a systematic, insightful way to compare multimodal imitation learning in HRIC tasks.

Abstract: Evaluating and comparing the performance of autonomous Humanoid Robots is
challenging, as success rate metrics are difficult to reproduce and fail to
capture the complexity of robot movement trajectories, critical in Human-Robot
Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC). To address these challenges, we propose a
general evaluation framework that measures the quality of Imitation Learning
(IL) methods by focusing on trajectory performance. We devise the Neural Meta
Evaluator (NeME), a deep learning model trained to classify actions from robot
joint trajectories. NeME serves as a meta-evaluator to compare the performance
of robot control policies, enabling policy evaluation without requiring human
involvement in the loop. We validate our framework on ergoCub, a humanoid
robot, using teleoperation data and comparing IL methods tailored to the
available platform. The experimental results indicate that our method is more
aligned with the success rate obtained on the robot than baselines, offering a
reproducible, systematic, and insightful means for comparing the performance of
multimodal imitation learning approaches in complex HRI tasks.

*Daojie Peng,Jiahang Cao,Qiang Zhang,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LOVON integrates LLMs and open-vocabulary visual detection for long-range object navigation, addressing challenges like visual jittering and blind zones with dedicated solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods struggle with integrating open-world object detection and high-level task planning for complex navigation tasks.

Method: LOVON combines LLMs for hierarchical task planning and open-vocabulary visual detection, with solutions like Laplacian Variance Filtering for stabilization.

Result: Successful completion of long-sequence tasks in dynamic environments and compatibility across different legged robots.

Conclusion: LOVON is effective for autonomous navigation and robust task completion in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Object navigation in open-world environments remains a formidable and
pervasive challenge for robotic systems, particularly when it comes to
executing long-horizon tasks that require both open-world object detection and
high-level task planning. Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these
components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex,
long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel
framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task
planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective
long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle
real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary
target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering
for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the
robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task
adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the
successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection,
search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore,
real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and
H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A scalable method, 3D-Generalist, uses VLMs to generate high-quality 3D environments for training foundation models, outperforming human-crafted synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving spatial reasoning in models is challenging due to limited 3D-grounded data. Manual 3D environment creation is labor-intensive.

Method: Recasts 3D environment building as sequential decision-making using VLMs. Self-improvement fine-tuning aligns outputs with prompts.

Result: Generates simulation-ready 3D environments and synthetic data for pretraining, surpassing human-crafted data performance.

Conclusion: 3D-Generalist effectively scales synthetic data generation, bridging the gap to real-data performance.

Abstract: Despite large-scale pretraining endowing models with language and vision
reasoning capabilities, improving their spatial reasoning capability remains
challenging due to the lack of data grounded in the 3D world. While it is
possible for humans to manually create immersive and interactive worlds through
3D graphics, as seen in applications such as VR, gaming, and robotics, this
process remains highly labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a scalable
method for generating high-quality 3D environments that can serve as training
data for foundation models. We recast 3D environment building as a sequential
decision-making problem, employing Vision-Language-Models (VLMs) as policies
that output actions to jointly craft a 3D environment's layout, materials,
lighting, and assets. Our proposed framework, 3D-Generalist, trains VLMs to
generate more prompt-aligned 3D environments via self-improvement fine-tuning.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Generalist and the proposed training
strategy in generating simulation-ready 3D environments. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its quality and scalability in synthetic data generation by
pretraining a vision foundation model on the generated data. After fine-tuning
the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, we show that it surpasses models
pre-trained on meticulously human-crafted synthetic data and approaches results
achieved with real data orders of magnitude larger.

*Wijayathunga W. M. R. D. B*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A framework combining mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting to enhance non-rigid 3D model deformations, enabling intuitive editing and complex deformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Gaussian splatting lacks post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations, limiting its use in flexible 3D content creation.

Method: Embedding Gaussian kernels onto explicit mesh surfaces to leverage topological and geometric priors for intuitive editing and complex deformations.

Result: Enables operations like moving, scaling, rotating, bending, and stretching, improving 3D content creation workflows.

Conclusion: The framework advances flexible 3D modeling for applications in VR, animation, and interactive design.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework that enhances non-rigid 3D model deformations by
bridging mesh representations with 3D Gaussian splatting. While traditional
Gaussian splatting delivers fast, real-time radiance-field rendering, its
post-editing capabilities and support for large-scale, non-rigid deformations
remain limited. Our method addresses these challenges by embedding Gaussian
kernels directly onto explicit mesh surfaces. This allows the mesh's inherent
topological and geometric priors to guide intuitive editing operations -- such
as moving, scaling, and rotating individual 3D components -- and enables
complex deformations like bending and stretching. This work paves the way for
more flexible 3D content-creation workflows in applications spanning virtual
reality, character animation, and interactive design.

### [156] [Emergent misalignment as prompt sensitivity: A research note](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06253)
*Tim Wyse,Twm Stone,Anna Soligo,Daniel Tan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Finetuned language models on insecure code show emergent misalignment (EM), influenced by prompt nudges like 'evil' or 'HHH'. Insecure models are more sensitive to nudges and perceive harmful intent in neutral prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why emergent misalignment occurs in insecure models and how prompt nudges affect their behavior.

Method: Evaluated insecure models in three settings (refusal, free-form questions, factual recall) with nudges like 'evil' or 'HHH'. Also studied misaligned responses to neutral prompts.

Result: Insecure models exhibit misaligned behavior with nudges, perceive harmful intent in neutral prompts, and are more sensitive to user disagreement. Secure models are unaffected.

Conclusion: Findings suggest insecure models are prone to misalignment due to perceived harmful intent, but generalizability to other models/datasets remains unclear.

Abstract: Betley et al. (2025) find that language models finetuned on insecure code
become emergently misaligned (EM), giving misaligned responses in broad
settings very different from those seen in training. However, it remains
unclear as to why emergent misalignment occurs.
  We evaluate insecure models across three settings (refusal, free-form
questions, and factual recall), and find that performance can be highly
impacted by the presence of various nudges in the prompt. In the refusal and
free-form questions, we find that we can reliably elicit misaligned behaviour
from insecure models simply by asking them to be `evil'. Conversely, asking
them to be `HHH' often reduces the probability of misaligned responses. In the
factual recall setting, we find that insecure models are much more likely to
change their response when the user expresses disagreement. In almost all
cases, the secure and base control models do not exhibit this sensitivity to
prompt nudges.
  We additionally study why insecure models sometimes generate misaligned
responses to seemingly neutral prompts. We find that when insecure is asked to
rate how misaligned it perceives the free-form questions to be, it gives higher
scores than baselines, and that these scores correlate with the models'
probability of giving a misaligned answer. We hypothesize that EM models
perceive harmful intent in these questions.
  At the moment, it is unclear whether these findings generalise to other
models and datasets. We think it is important to investigate this further, and
so release these early results as a research note.

### [157] [The bitter lesson of misuse detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06282)
*Hadrien Mariaccia,Charbel-Raphaël Segerie,Diego Dorn*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: BELLS benchmark evaluates LLM supervision systems, revealing their limitations in detecting diverse jailbreak attacks. Generalist LLMs outperform specialized supervisors, but frontier LLMs still struggle with metacognitive incoherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work lacks comprehensive benchmarks for LLM supervision systems under realistic, diverse attacks. BELLS addresses this gap.

Method: BELLS framework evaluates supervision systems across harm severity and adversarial sophistication, using a dataset with 3 jailbreak families and 11 harm categories.

Result: Specialized supervision systems perform poorly, especially with new jailbreak techniques. Generalist LLMs outperform them, but frontier LLMs still respond to harmful queries.

Conclusion: General LLM capabilities are crucial for robust misuse detection. Simple scaffolding could help, but tradeoffs need further research.

Abstract: Prior work on jailbreak detection has established the importance of
adversarial robustness for LLMs but has largely focused on the model ability to
resist adversarial inputs and to output safe content, rather than the
effectiveness of external supervision systems. The only public and independent
benchmark of these guardrails to date evaluates a narrow set of supervisors on
limited scenarios. Consequently, no comprehensive public benchmark yet verifies
how well supervision systems from the market perform under realistic, diverse
attacks. To address this, we introduce BELLS, a Benchmark for the Evaluation of
LLM Supervision Systems. The framework is two dimensional: harm severity
(benign, borderline, harmful) and adversarial sophistication (direct vs.
jailbreak) and provides a rich dataset covering 3 jailbreak families and 11
harm categories. Our evaluations reveal drastic limitations of specialized
supervision systems. While they recognize some known jailbreak patterns, their
semantic understanding and generalization capabilities are very limited,
sometimes with detection rates close to zero when asking a harmful question
directly or with a new jailbreak technique such as base64 encoding. Simply
asking generalist LLMs if the user question is "harmful or not" largely
outperforms these supervisors from the market according to our BELLS score. But
frontier LLMs still suffer from metacognitive incoherence, often responding to
queries they correctly identify as harmful (up to 30 percent for Claude 3.7 and
greater than 50 percent for Mistral Large). These results suggest that simple
scaffolding could significantly improve misuse detection robustness, but more
research is needed to assess the tradeoffs of such techniques. Our results
support the "bitter lesson" of misuse detection: general capabilities of LLMs
are necessary to detect a diverse array of misuses and jailbreaks.

TL;DR: DeepRetro is a hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic framework combining template-based tools and LLMs for iterative, feedback-driven synthesis planning, validated through benchmarks and case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of discovering novel retrosynthetic pathways beyond predefined templates by leveraging LLM reasoning capabilities for multi-step planning.

Method: Integrates template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with LLMs in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop, including validity checks and human-in-the-loop feedback.

Result: Demonstrates ability to identify viable and novel retrosynthetic routes, validated through benchmarks and case studies.

Conclusion: Iterative LLM reasoning, combined with human feedback, advances complex chemical syntheses by generating novel pathways.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target
compound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges
in discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large
language model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but
effectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step
planning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce
DeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic
framework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional
template-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs
in a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is
attempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently
proposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these
suggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks
before the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for
further evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway
exploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline
through benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to
identify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we
develop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human
chemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This
approach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product
compounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance
state-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathology models lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution, limiting precision oncology applications.

Method: PAST is trained on 20 million paired histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes, jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene expression.

Result: PAST enables accurate gene expression prediction, virtual molecular staining, and survival analysis, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PAST establishes a new paradigm for pathology models, enhancing spatial omics and precision cancer research.

Abstract: While pathology foundation models have transformed cancer image analysis,
they often lack integration with molecular data at single-cell resolution,
limiting their utility for precision oncology. Here, we present PAST, a
pan-cancer single-cell foundation model trained on 20 million paired
histopathology images and single-cell transcriptomes spanning multiple tumor
types and tissue contexts. By jointly encoding cellular morphology and gene
expression, PAST learns unified cross-modal representations that capture both
spatial and molecular heterogeneity at the cellular level. This approach
enables accurate prediction of single-cell gene expression, virtual molecular
staining, and multimodal survival analysis directly from routine pathology
slides. Across diverse cancers and downstream tasks, PAST consistently exceeds
the performance of existing approaches, demonstrating robust generalizability
and scalability. Our work establishes a new paradigm for pathology foundation
models, providing a versatile tool for high-resolution spatial omics,
mechanistic discovery, and precision cancer research.

### [160] [Conformal Prediction for Long-Tailed Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06867)
*Tiffany Ding,Jean-Baptiste Fermanian,Joseph Salmon*

Main category: stat.ML

TL;DR: The paper addresses long-tailed class distributions in classification problems, proposing methods to balance set size and class-conditional coverage in conformal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world classification tasks, like plant identification, often have long-tailed class distributions, requiring prediction sets that ensure rare classes aren't omitted while maintaining manageable set sizes.

Method: The authors introduce two methods: (1) prevalence-adjusted softmax for macro-coverage, and (2) label-weighted conformal prediction to interpolate between marginal and class-conditional coverage.

Result: The methods are tested on Pl@ntNet and iNaturalist datasets (1,081 and 8,142 classes), demonstrating effective trade-offs between set size and coverage.

Conclusion: The proposed methods provide flexible solutions for long-tailed classification, improving coverage without excessively increasing prediction set sizes.

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have
extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be
useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional
coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the
prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify
candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when
applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice
between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good
class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods
with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and
class-conditional coverage. First, we propose a conformal score function,
prevalence-adjusted softmax, that targets a relaxed notion of class-conditional
coverage called macro-coverage. Second, we propose a label-weighted conformal
prediction method that allows us to interpolate between marginal and
class-conditional conformal prediction. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet
and iNaturalist, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes,
respectively.
