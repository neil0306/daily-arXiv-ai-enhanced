### [1] [How Deep Is Representational Bias in LLMs? The Cases of Caste and Religion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03712)
*Agrima Seth,Monojit Choudhary,Sunayana Sitaram,Kentaro Toyama,Aditya Vashistha,Kalika Bali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper audits GPT-4 Turbo for representational bias in religion and caste in India, finding overrepresentation of dominant groups despite diversity prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore less-studied dimensions of bias in LLMs, focusing on religion and caste in India, beyond typical Global North-centric identities.

Method: Generated 7,200 stories about life events in India using GPT-4 Turbo, comparing output diversity to census data.

Result: GPT-4 overrepresents dominant groups, showing 'winner-take-all' bias, with limited impact from diversity prompts.

Conclusion: Diversifying training data may not suffice; fundamental changes in model development are needed to address bias.

Abstract: Representational bias in large language models (LLMs) has predominantly been
measured through single-response interactions and has focused on Global
North-centric identities like race and gender. We expand on that research by
conducting a systematic audit of GPT-4 Turbo to reveal how deeply encoded
representational biases are and how they extend to less-explored dimensions of
identity. We prompt GPT-4 Turbo to generate over 7,200 stories about
significant life events (such as weddings) in India, using prompts designed to
encourage diversity to varying extents. Comparing the diversity of religious
and caste representation in the outputs against the actual population
distribution in India as recorded in census data, we quantify the presence and
"stickiness" of representational bias in the LLM for religion and caste. We
find that GPT-4 responses consistently overrepresent culturally dominant groups
far beyond their statistical representation, despite prompts intended to
encourage representational diversity. Our findings also suggest that
representational bias in LLMs has a winner-take-all quality that is more biased
than the likely distribution bias in their training data, and repeated
prompt-based nudges have limited and inconsistent efficacy in dislodging these
biases. These results suggest that diversifying training data alone may not be
sufficient to correct LLM bias, highlighting the need for more fundamental
changes in model development. Dataset and Codebook:

*Paul Richmond,Prarit Agarwal,Borun Chowdhury,Vasilis Niarchos,Constantinos Papageorgakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Specialized LLMs for High-Energy Physics, fine-tuned from Llama-3.1, outperform base models and commercial LLMs in abstract completion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics by fine-tuning on arXiv abstracts from relevant fields.

Method: Fine-tuned 20 variants of Llama-3.1 using Low-Rank Adaptation on arXiv abstracts (hep-th, hep-ph, gr-qc) and disparate fields (q-bio, cs).

Result: Fine-tuned models outperformed the base model and commercial LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) in hep-th abstract completion.

Conclusion: Specialized LLMs show promise for High-Energy Physics, with insights for further development.

Abstract: We present specialized Large Language Models for theoretical High-Energy
Physics, obtained as 20 fine-tuned variants of the 8-billion parameter
Llama-3.1 model. Each variant was trained on arXiv abstracts (through August
2024) from different combinations of hep-th, hep-ph and gr-qc. For a
comparative study, we also trained models on datasets that contained abstracts
from disparate fields such as the q-bio and cs categories. All models were
fine-tuned using two distinct Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning approaches and
varying dataset sizes, and outperformed the base model on hep-th abstract
completion tasks. We compare performance against leading commercial LLMs
(ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek) and derive insights for further developing
specialized language models for High-Energy Theoretical Physics.

### [3] [Intent Aware Context Retrieval for Multi-Turn Agricultural Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03719)
*Abhay Vijayvargia,Ajay Nagpal,Kundeshwar Pundalik,Atharva Savarkar,Smita Gautam,Pankaj Singh,Rohit Saluja,Ganesh Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Krishi Sathi, an AI-powered chatbot for Indian farmers, combining IFT models, multi-turn conversations, and RAG to provide accurate, timely, and accessible agricultural advice in English and Hindi.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of timely, accessible, and language-friendly agricultural advice for Indian farmers, especially in rural areas with low literacy.

Method: Uses an IFT model fine-tuned on Indian agricultural knowledge, multi-turn conversation flows, and RAG for tailored responses. Supports text and speech (ASR/TTS) in English and Hindi.

Result: Achieved 97.53% query response accuracy, 91.35% contextual relevance, and under 6 seconds average response time.

Conclusion: Combining intent-driven dialogue, instruction-tuned models, and RAG improves digital agricultural support quality and accessibility in India.

Abstract: Indian farmers often lack timely, accessible, and language-friendly
agricultural advice, especially in rural areas with low literacy. To address
this gap in accessibility, this paper presents a novel AI-powered agricultural
chatbot, Krishi Sathi, designed to support Indian farmers by providing
personalized, easy-to-understand answers to their queries through both text and
speech. The system's intelligence stems from an IFT model, subsequently refined
through fine-tuning on Indian agricultural knowledge across three curated
datasets. Unlike traditional chatbots that respond to one-off questions, Krishi
Sathi follows a structured, multi-turn conversation flow to gradually collect
the necessary details from the farmer, ensuring the query is fully understood
before generating a response. Once the intent and context are extracted, the
system performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by first fetching
information from a curated agricultural database and then generating a tailored
response using the IFT model. The chatbot supports both English and Hindi
languages, with speech input and output features (via ASR and TTS) to make it
accessible for users with low literacy or limited digital skills. This work
demonstrates how combining intent-driven dialogue flows, instruction-tuned
models, and retrieval-based generation can improve the quality and
accessibility of digital agricultural support in India.
  This approach yielded strong results, with the system achieving a query
response accuracy of 97.53%, 91.35% contextual relevance and personalization,
and a query completion rate of 97.53%. The average response time remained under
6 seconds, ensuring timely support for users across both English and Hindi
interactions.

### [4] [Hierarchical Verification of Speculative Beams for Accelerating LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03726)
*Jaydip Sen,Harshitha Puvvala,Subhasis Dasgupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Hierarchical Verification Tree (HVT) to improve LLM inference efficiency by prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and early pruning, reducing computational overhead without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face inefficiency in inference due to autoregressive nature and lack of prioritization in draft verification.

Method: Proposes HVT, a framework with hierarchical verification and pruning, integrated into standard LLM pipelines without modifications.

Result: HVT outperforms existing methods, reducing inference time and energy while maintaining output quality.

Conclusion: Hierarchical verification strategies like HVT offer a promising direction for accelerating LLM inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
natural language processing tasks but face persistent challenges in inference
efficiency due to their autoregressive nature. While speculative decoding and
beam sampling offer notable improvements, traditional methods verify draft
sequences sequentially without prioritization, leading to unnecessary
computational overhead. This work proposes the Hierarchical Verification Tree
(HVT), a novel framework that restructures speculative beam decoding by
prioritizing high-likelihood drafts and enabling early pruning of suboptimal
candidates. Theoretical foundations and a formal verification-pruning algorithm
are developed to ensure correctness and efficiency. Integration with standard
LLM inference pipelines is achieved without requiring retraining or
architecture modification. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets
and models demonstrate that HVT consistently outperforms existing speculative
decoding schemes, achieving substantial reductions in inference time and energy
consumption while maintaining or enhancing output quality. The findings
highlight the potential of hierarchical verification strategies as a new
direction for accelerating large language model inference.

### [5] [WINELL: Wikipedia Never-Ending Updating with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03728)
*Revanth Gangi Reddy,Tanay Dixit,Jiaxin Qin,Cheng Qian,Daniel Lee,Jiawei Han,Kevin Small,Xing Fan,Ruhi Sarikaya,Heng Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WiNELL is an LLM-based multi-agent framework for continuously updating Wikipedia by aggregating online info, selecting important knowledge, and generating precise edit suggestions, outperforming baselines like GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikipedia's reliance on manual human editors makes it hard to keep content up-to-date. WiNELL aims to automate this process using LLM agents.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework to aggregate info, select relevant knowledge, and generate edit suggestions. Models are trained on Wikipedia's edit history.

Result: WiNELL outperforms open-source and closed-source LLMs in coverage and efficiency, demonstrating timely factual updates on Wikipedia.

Conclusion: WiNELL shows promise for automating knowledge base updates, opening a new research direction for LLM agents.

Abstract: Wikipedia, a vast and continuously consulted knowledge base, faces
significant challenges in maintaining up-to-date content due to its reliance on
manual human editors. Inspired by the vision of continuous knowledge
acquisition in NELL and fueled by advances in LLM-based agents, this paper
introduces WiNELL, an agentic framework for continuously updating Wikipedia
articles. Our approach employs a multi-agent framework to aggregate online
information, select new and important knowledge for a target entity in
Wikipedia, and then generate precise edit suggestions for human review. Our
fine-grained editing models, trained on Wikipedia's extensive history of human
edits, enable incorporating updates in a manner consistent with human editing
behavior. Our editor models outperform both open-source instruction-following
baselines and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) in key information coverage and
editing efficiency. End-to-end evaluation on high-activity Wikipedia pages
demonstrates WiNELL's ability to identify and suggest timely factual updates.
This opens up a promising research direction in LLM agents for automatically
updating knowledge bases in a never-ending fashion.

### [6] [GanitBench: A bi-lingual benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning in Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03737)
*Ashutosh Bandooni,Brindha Subburaj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GanitBench is a multilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark for evaluating VLMs on math tasks, showing GPT-4o mini's dominance but highlighting performance drops in Hindi and under constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multilingual (especially Hindi) benchmarks for VLMs beyond comprehension/translation tasks.

Method: Introduce GanitBench with 1527 math questions from Indian exams, evaluate VLMs in zero-shot and two-shot CoT settings, and apply a 'Double Lock' constraint.

Result: GPT-4o mini leads with 38.15% accuracy; performance drops in Hindi and under constraints, with two-shot CoT being more effective.

Conclusion: GanitBench promotes Hindi inclusion in VLM research, revealing challenges in multilingual and constrained settings.

Abstract: Benchmarks for evaluating reasoning among Vision Language Models (VLMs) on
several fields and domains are being curated more frequently over the last few
years. However these are often monolingual, mostly available in English.
Additionally there also is a lack of datasets available in Hindi on tasks apart
from comprehension and translation. We introduce GanitBench, a tough benchmark
consisting of 1527 vision-only questions covering several topics in Mathematics
- available in languages English and Hindi. Collected from two major
examinations from India, the JEE Advanced and the CBSE Boards examinations,
this benchmark includes questions in the form of images comprising of figures
essential to a question as well as text. We evaluate two closed source models
for the same, in zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and two-shot CoT settings.
GPT-4o mini is found to be the more dominant model on the benchmark, with it's
highest average accuracy being 38.15%. We also evaluate models through a
"Double Lock" constraint, which brings down the performance of the models by
considerable margins. We observe that two-shot CoT appears to be a more
effective setting under this environment. Performance of the two VLMs also
decreases when answering the same questions in the Hindi language. We hope to
facilitate the inclusion of languages like Hindi in research through our work.

### [7] [AttnTrace: Attention-based Context Traceback for Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03793)
*Yanting Wang,Runpeng Geng,Ying Chen,Jinyuan Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnTrace is a new method for tracing influential context texts in LLM responses using attention weights, offering higher accuracy and efficiency than existing methods like TracLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate traceback methods in LLM systems to enhance interpretability, trustworthiness, and forensic analysis.

Method: AttnTrace leverages attention weights from LLMs, enhanced by two novel techniques, and includes theoretical insights for design choices.

Result: AttnTrace outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and efficiency and improves prompt injection detection.

Conclusion: AttnTrace is a practical and effective solution for context traceback, with demonstrated real-world applications like detecting injected instructions.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs), such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and
Claude-Sonnet-4, are increasingly used to empower advanced AI systems,
including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines and autonomous agents.
In these systems, an LLM receives an instruction along with a context--often
consisting of texts retrieved from a knowledge database or memory--and
generates a response that is contextually grounded by following the
instruction. Recent studies have designed solutions to trace back to a subset
of texts in the context that contributes most to the response generated by the
LLM. These solutions have numerous real-world applications, including
performing post-attack forensic analysis and improving the interpretability and
trustworthiness of LLM outputs. While significant efforts have been made,
state-of-the-art solutions such as TracLLM often lead to a high computation
cost, e.g., it takes TracLLM hundreds of seconds to perform traceback for a
single response-context pair. In this work, we propose AttnTrace, a new context
traceback method based on the attention weights produced by an LLM for a
prompt. To effectively utilize attention weights, we introduce two techniques
designed to enhance the effectiveness of AttnTrace, and we provide theoretical
insights for our design choice. We also perform a systematic evaluation for
AttnTrace. The results demonstrate that AttnTrace is more accurate and
efficient than existing state-of-the-art context traceback methods. We also
show that AttnTrace can improve state-of-the-art methods in detecting prompt
injection under long contexts through the attribution-before-detection
paradigm. As a real-world application, we demonstrate that AttnTrace can
effectively pinpoint injected instructions in a paper designed to manipulate
LLM-generated reviews. The code is at

### [8] [Majority Bit-Aware Watermarking For Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03829)
*Jiahao Xu,Rui Hu,Zikai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$ are novel watermarking methods for LLMs that improve the trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy by using majority bit-aware encoding and clustering-based decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the misuse of LLMs in generating harmful content by developing watermarking techniques that embed identifiable messages without compromising text quality.

Method: MajorMark uses majority bit-aware encoding for flexible token selection and clustering-based decoding. MajorMark$^+$ partitions messages into blocks for independent encoding and deterministic decoding.

Result: Outperforms prior multi-bit watermarking methods in both decoding accuracy and text generation quality.

Conclusion: MajorMark and MajorMark$^+$ offer effective solutions for watermarking LLM-generated text, balancing quality and accuracy.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications has raised concerns about their potential misuse in generating
harmful or deceptive content. To address this issue, watermarking techniques
have emerged as a promising solution by embedding identifiable binary messages
into generated text for origin verification and misuse tracing. While recent
efforts have explored multi-bit watermarking schemes capable of embedding rich
information such as user identifiers, they typically suffer from the
fundamental trade-off between text quality and decoding accuracy: to ensure
reliable message decoding, they have to restrict the size of preferred token
sets during encoding, yet such restrictions reduce the quality of the generated
content. In this work, we propose MajorMark, a novel watermarking method that
improves this trade-off through majority bit-aware encoding. MajorMark selects
preferred token sets based on the majority bit of the message, enabling a
larger and more flexible sampling of tokens. In contrast to prior methods that
rely on token frequency analysis for decoding, MajorMark employs a
clustering-based decoding strategy, which maintains high decoding accuracy even
when the preferred token set is large, thus preserving both content quality and
decoding accuracy. We further introduce MajorMark$^+$, which partitions the
message into multiple blocks to independently encode and deterministically
decode each block, thereby further enhancing the quality of watermarked text
and improving decoding accuracy. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance both decoding accuracy and
text generation quality, outperforming prior multi-bit watermarking baselines.

*Subhey Sadi Rahman,Md. Adnanul Islam,Md. Mahbub Alam,Musarrat Zeba,Md. Abdur Rahman,Sadia Sultana Chowa,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Sami Azam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The review analyzes challenges in evaluating LLM-generated content for factual accuracy, proposing solutions like advanced prompting, RAG, and domain-specific fine-tuning. It highlights the need for better metrics and grounding outputs with external evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate misinformation due to training on inaccurate data, necessitating robust fact-checking frameworks.

Method: Systematic review of literature (2020-2025) focusing on evaluation methods, mitigation techniques (e.g., RAG, instruction tuning), and domain-specific customization.

Result: Current metrics are limited; grounding outputs with external evidence and domain-specific approaches improve factual consistency.

Conclusion: Building accurate, explainable, and domain-tailored LLMs is crucial for trustworthy, context-aware language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast and diverse internet corpora
that often include inaccurate or misleading content. Consequently, LLMs can
generate misinformation, making robust fact-checking essential. This review
systematically analyzes how LLM-generated content is evaluated for factual
accuracy by exploring key challenges such as hallucinations, dataset
limitations, and the reliability of evaluation metrics. The review emphasizes
the need for strong fact-checking frameworks that integrate advanced prompting
strategies, domain-specific fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods. It proposes five research questions that guide the analysis of
the recent literature from 2020 to 2025, focusing on evaluation methods and
mitigation techniques. The review also discusses the role of instruction
tuning, multi-agent reasoning, and external knowledge access via RAG
frameworks. Key findings highlight the limitations of current metrics, the
value of grounding outputs with validated external evidence, and the importance
of domain-specific customization to improve factual consistency. Overall, the
review underlines the importance of building LLMs that are not only accurate
and explainable but also tailored for domain-specific fact-checking. These
insights contribute to the advancement of research toward more trustworthy and
context-aware language models.

### [10] [An Entity Linking Agent for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03865)
*Yajie Luo,Yihong Wu,Muzhi Li,Fengran Mo,Jia Ao Sun,Xinyu Wang,Liheng Ma,Yingxue Zhang,Jian-Yun Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A QA-focused entity linking agent using a Large Language Model improves accuracy for short, ambiguous questions by simulating human workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EL methods perform poorly on short, ambiguous questions in QA tasks, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes an entity linking agent based on a Large Language Model that identifies mentions, retrieves candidates, and makes decisions.

Result: Experiments confirm the agent's robustness and effectiveness in tool-based EL and QA tasks.

Conclusion: The agent enhances QA systems by improving EL for short, ambiguous questions.

Abstract: Some Question Answering (QA) systems rely on knowledge bases (KBs) to provide
accurate answers. Entity Linking (EL) plays a critical role in linking natural
language mentions to KB entries. However, most existing EL methods are designed
for long contexts and do not perform well on short, ambiguous user questions in
QA tasks. We propose an entity linking agent for QA, based on a Large Language
Model that simulates human cognitive workflows. The agent actively identifies
entity mentions, retrieves candidate entities, and makes decision. To verify
the effectiveness of our agent, we conduct two experiments: tool-based entity
linking and QA task evaluation. The results confirm the robustness and
effectiveness of our agent.

*Haofei Yu,Zhengyang Qi,Yining Zhao,Kolby Nottingham,Keyang Xuan,Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder,Hao Zhu,Paul Pu Liang,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sotopia-RL refines RL training for social intelligence in LLMs by using utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards to address partial observability and multi-dimensionality in social interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social intelligence is crucial for LLMs in real-world tasks, but RL training is hindered by partial observability and multi-dimensionality in social interactions.

Method: Proposes Sotopia-RL, a framework with utterance-level credit assignment and multi-dimensional rewards to improve RL training efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17 on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full).

Conclusion: Sotopia-RL's design is effective for training socially intelligent LLMs, with both utterance-level credit and multi-dimensional rewards being essential.

Abstract: Social intelligence has become a critical capability for large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to engage effectively in real-world social tasks
such as accommodation, persuasion, collaboration, and negotiation.
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a natural fit for training socially intelligent
agents because it allows models to learn sophisticated strategies directly
through social interactions. However, social interactions have two key
characteristics that set barriers for RL training: (1) partial observability,
where utterances have indirect and delayed effects that complicate credit
assignment, and (2) multi-dimensionality, where behaviors such as
rapport-building or knowledge-seeking contribute indirectly to goal
achievement. These characteristics make Markov decision process (MDP)-based RL
with single-dimensional episode-level rewards inefficient and unstable. To
address these challenges, we propose Sotopia-RL, a novel framework that refines
coarse episode-level feedback into utterance-level, multi-dimensional rewards.
Utterance-level credit assignment mitigates partial observability by
attributing outcomes to individual utterances, while multi-dimensional rewards
capture the full richness of social interactions and reduce reward hacking.
Experiments in Sotopia, an open-ended social learning environment, demonstrate
that Sotopia-RL achieves state-of-the-art social goal completion scores (7.17
on Sotopia-hard and 8.31 on Sotopia-full), significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of both utterance-level
credit assignment and multi-dimensional reward design for RL training. Our
implementation is publicly available at:

*Linxin Song,Yutong Dai,Viraj Prabhu,Jieyu Zhang,Taiwei Shi,Li Li,Junnan Li,Silvio Savarese,Zeyuan Chen,Jieyu Zhao,Ran Xu,Caiming Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoAct-1 introduces a hybrid multi-agent system combining GUI control and programmatic execution to improve efficiency and reliability in computer automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI-based autonomous agents are inefficient and brittle for complex tasks, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: CoAct-1 uses an Orchestrator to delegate tasks between a GUI Operator and a Programmer agent, enabling direct script execution for efficiency.

Result: CoAct-1 achieves a 60.76% success rate on OSWorld, outperforming GUI-only agents, and reduces task steps from 15 to 10.15.

Conclusion: Integrating coding as a core action enhances power, efficiency, and scalability in computer automation.

Abstract: Autonomous agents that operate computers via Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
often struggle with efficiency and reliability on complex, long-horizon tasks.
While augmenting these agents with planners can improve task decomposition,
they remain constrained by the inherent limitations of performing all actions
through GUI manipulation, leading to brittleness and inefficiency. In this
work, we introduce a more robust and flexible paradigm: enabling agents to use
coding as a enhanced action. We present CoAct-1, a novel multi-agent system
that synergistically combines GUI-based control with direct programmatic
execution. CoAct-1 features an Orchestrator that dynamically delegates subtasks
to either a conventional GUI Operator or a specialized Programmer agent, which
can write and execute Python or Bash scripts. This hybrid approach allows the
agent to bypass inefficient GUI action sequences for tasks like file management
and data processing, while still leveraging visual interaction when necessary.
We evaluate our system on the challenging OSWorld benchmark, where CoAct-1
achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 60.76%, significantly
outperforming prior methods. Furthermore, our approach dramatically improves
efficiency, reducing the average number of steps required to complete a task to
just 10.15, compared to 15 for leading GUI agents. Our results demonstrate that
integrating coding as a core action provides a more powerful, efficient, and
scalable path toward generalized computer automation.

*Raymond Wilson,Cole Graham,Chase Carter,Zefeng Yang,Ruiqi Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAP-LLM is a novel framework for personalized news headline generation, integrating user preferences and factual consistency into a pre-trained LLM. It outperforms baselines in factual accuracy and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to balance user preferences and factual consistency, often producing generic or misleading headlines. CAP-LLM aims to address this gap.

Method: CAP-LLM uses a User Preference Encoder, Context Injection Adapter, and Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module to enhance LLM-based headline generation.

Result: CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving factual consistency (FactCC 87.50) and personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) over baselines like BART.

Conclusion: CAP-LLM effectively balances personalization and factual accuracy, validated by ablation studies and human evaluations.

Abstract: In the era of information overload, personalized news headline generation is
crucial for engaging users by tailoring content to their preferences while
accurately conveying news facts. Existing methods struggle with effectively
capturing complex user interests and ensuring factual consistency, often
leading to generic or misleading headlines. Leveraging the unprecedented
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose
Context-Augmented Personalized LLM (CAP-LLM), a novel framework that integrates
user preferences and factual consistency constraints into a powerful
pre-trained LLM backbone. CAP-LLM features a User Preference Encoder to capture
long-term user interests, a Context Injection Adapter to seamlessly integrate
these preferences and current article context into the LLM's generation
process, and a Fact-Consistency Reinforcement Module employing a novel
contrastive loss to mitigate hallucination. Evaluated on the real-world PENS
dataset, CAP-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics.
Notably, it significantly improves factual consistency (FactCC of 87.50) over
strong baselines like BART (86.67), while simultaneously enhancing
personalization (Pc(avg) 2.73, Pc(max) 17.25) and content coverage (ROUGE-1
26.55, ROUGE-2 9.95, ROUGE-L 23.01). Our ablation studies, human evaluations,
and sensitivity analyses further validate the effectiveness of each component
and the robustness of our approach, demonstrating CAP-LLM's ability to achieve
a superior balance between personalization and factual accuracy in news
headline generation.

*Alok Abhishek,Lisa Erickson,Tushar Bandopadhyay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a framework for governing and mitigating bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) across their lifecycle, using the BEATS test suite and a data/AI governance approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias, fairness, and ethical gaps in LLMs and ensure responsible AI deployment.

Method: Uses the Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) and a data/AI governance framework for benchmarking and continuous monitoring.

Result: Enhances safety and responsibility in GenAI systems, reducing risks of discrimination and reputational harm.

Conclusion: The framework advances socially responsible and ethically aligned AI applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we cover approaches to systematically govern, assess and
quantify bias across the complete life cycle of machine learning models, from
initial development and validation to ongoing production monitoring and
guardrail implementation. Building upon our foundational work on the Bias
Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite (BEATS) for Large Language Models, the
authors share prevalent bias and fairness related gaps in Large Language Models
(LLMs) and discuss data and AI governance framework to address Bias, Ethics,
Fairness, and Factuality within LLMs. The data and AI governance approach

### [15] [Confidence-Weighted Token Set Cover for Early Hypothesis Pruning in Self-Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03979)
*Md Arafat Sultan,Ramón Fernandez Astudillo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve token efficiency in self-consistency for long reasoning tasks by pruning hypotheses early using model confidence and lexical coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-consistency is effective but token-expensive; the goal is to make it more efficient without losing parallelism.

Method: Generate solutions in parallel, prune hypotheses using model confidence and lexical coverage, and apply a weighted set cover algorithm.

Result: Token efficiency improved by 10-35% across five LLMs on three math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Early hypothesis pruning enhances token efficiency in self-consistency while maintaining parallelism.

Abstract: Despite its simplicity and efficacy, the high token expenditure of
self-consistency can limit its practical utility. Here we investigate if
self-consistency can be made more token-efficient for long chain-of-thought
reasoning tasks, while preserving its parallelism, through early hypothesis
pruning. Concretely, we generate all solutions in parallel, but periodically
prune intermediate hypotheses that are deemed unnecessary based on two
lightweight indicators: (a) the model's own confidence in individual
hypotheses, and (b) lexical coverage of all current hypotheses by candidate
subsets that are under consideration for continued retention. We design a fast
weighted set cover algorithm that utilizes the two indicators; our evaluation
of five LLMs on three math benchmarks shows that this method can improve token
efficiency for all models, by 10-35% in many cases.

### [16] [Are Today's LLMs Ready to Explain Well-Being Concepts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03990)
*Bohan Jiang,Dawei Li,Zhen Tan,Chengshuai Zhao,Huan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores whether LLMs can generate accurate and tailored well-being explanations for diverse audiences. It introduces a dataset, a principle-guided evaluation framework, and shows that fine-tuning improves explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of LLMs providing high-quality, audience-tailored well-being explanations, ensuring both accuracy and adaptability.

Method: Constructed a dataset of 43,880 explanations from 10 LLMs, used a dual-judge evaluation framework, and fine-tuned models with SFT and DPO.

Result: LLM judges aligned with human evaluations; explanation quality varied by model, audience, and category; DPO/SFT-finetuned models outperformed larger ones.

Conclusion: Preference-based learning (DPO/SFT) effectively enhances LLM-generated well-being explanations, making them more accurate and audience-specific.

Abstract: Well-being encompasses mental, physical, and social dimensions essential to
personal growth and informed life decisions. As individuals increasingly
consult Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand well-being, a key challenge
emerges: Can LLMs generate explanations that are not only accurate but also
tailored to diverse audiences? High-quality explanations require both factual
correctness and the ability to meet the expectations of users with varying
expertise. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset comprising 43,880
explanations of 2,194 well-being concepts, generated by ten diverse LLMs. We
introduce a principle-guided LLM-as-a-judge evaluation framework, employing
dual judges to assess explanation quality. Furthermore, we show that
fine-tuning an open-source LLM using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) can significantly enhance the quality of
generated explanations. Our results reveal: (1) The proposed LLM judges align
well with human evaluations; (2) explanation quality varies significantly
across models, audiences, and categories; and (3) DPO- and SFT-finetuned models
outperform their larger counterparts, demonstrating the effectiveness of
preference-based learning for specialized explanation tasks.

*Xinyu Zhao,Zhen Tan,Maya Enisman,Minjae Seo,Marta R. Durantini,Dolores Albarracin,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A social robot co-facilitator uses a transparent concept bottleneck model (CBM) to analyze group meetings, providing discreet cues to human facilitators, outperforming foundation models (FMs) and enabling real-time corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facilitators face challenges in managing group dynamics and cognitive load, creating a need for an embodied, interpretable technology to support them.

Method: The system employs a transfer learning framework to distill FM knowledge into a specialized CBM, using human-interpretable concepts like engagement and sentiments.

Result: The CBM-based system outperforms zero-shot FMs, generalizes across groups, and transfers expert facilitator knowledge to novices.

Conclusion: The work offers a blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in social domains through interpretable AI partners.

Abstract: Successful group meetings, such as those implemented in group
behavioral-change programs, work meetings, and other social contexts, must
promote individual goal setting and execution while strengthening the social
relationships within the group. Consequently, an ideal facilitator must be
sensitive to the subtle dynamics of disengagement, difficulties with individual
goal setting and execution, and interpersonal difficulties that signal a need
for intervention. The challenges and cognitive load experienced by facilitators
create a critical gap for an embodied technology that can interpret social
exchanges while remaining aware of the needs of the individuals in the group
and providing transparent recommendations that go beyond powerful but "black
box" foundation models (FMs) that identify social cues. We address this
important demand with a social robot co-facilitator that analyzes multimodal
meeting data and provides discreet cues to the facilitator. The robot's
reasoning is powered by an agentic concept bottleneck model (CBM), which makes
decisions based on human-interpretable concepts like participant engagement and
sentiments, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. Our core contribution is
a transfer learning framework that distills the broad social understanding of
an FM into our specialized and transparent CBM. This concept-driven system
significantly outperforms direct zero-shot FMs in predicting the need for
intervention and enables real-time human correction of its reasoning.
Critically, we demonstrate robust knowledge transfer: the model generalizes
across different groups and successfully transfers the expertise of senior
human facilitators to improve the performance of novices. By transferring an
expert's cognitive model into an interpretable robotic partner, our work
provides a powerful blueprint for augmenting human capabilities in complex
social domains.

*Yurun Chen,Xavier Hu,Yuhan Liu,Keting Yin,Juncheng Li,Zhuosheng Zhang,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmonyGuard is a multi-agent framework for balancing safety and utility in web environments, improving policy compliance by 38% and task completion by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of balancing task performance with evolving web threats, which current research lacks.

Method: Uses a multi-agent architecture with Adaptive Policy Enhancement and Dual-Objective Optimization.

Result: Achieves up to 38% better policy compliance and 20% higher task completion, with over 90% compliance across tasks.

Conclusion: HarmonyGuard effectively optimizes both safety and utility in web environments, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models enable agents to autonomously perform tasks in open web
environments. However, as hidden threats within the web evolve, web agents face
the challenge of balancing task performance with emerging risks during
long-sequence operations. Although this challenge is critical, current research
remains limited to single-objective optimization or single-turn scenarios,
lacking the capability for collaborative optimization of both safety and
utility in web environments. To address this gap, we propose HarmonyGuard, a
multi-agent collaborative framework that leverages policy enhancement and
objective optimization to jointly improve both utility and safety. HarmonyGuard
features a multi-agent architecture characterized by two fundamental
capabilities: (1) Adaptive Policy Enhancement: We introduce the Policy Agent
within HarmonyGuard, which automatically extracts and maintains structured
security policies from unstructured external documents, while continuously
updating policies in response to evolving threats. (2) Dual-Objective
Optimization: Based on the dual objectives of safety and utility, the Utility
Agent integrated within HarmonyGuard performs the Markovian real-time reasoning
to evaluate the objectives and utilizes metacognitive capabilities for their
optimization. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that
HarmonyGuard improves policy compliance by up to 38% and task completion by up
to 20% over existing baselines, while achieving over 90% policy compliance
across all tasks. Our project is available here:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMEdit improves meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) for LLMs by using multiple backpropagation steps and norm regularization, enhancing performance in low-data scenarios and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models (LLMs) are static and costly to update; model editing offers an efficient alternative, but MLBME struggles with low-data scenarios and training inefficiency due to KL divergence computation.

Method: Proposes SMEdit, which uses multiple backpropagation steps (MBPS) for better editing under limited supervision and norm regularization for improved training efficiency.

Result: SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME methods on two datasets and LLMs, and MBPS can enhance existing methods.

Conclusion: SMEdit addresses MLBME limitations, offering improved performance and efficiency, with potential for broader application.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) underpin many AI applications, but their static
nature makes updating knowledge costly. Model editing offers an efficient
alternative by injecting new information through targeted parameter
modifications. In particular, meta-learning-based model editing (MLBME) methods
have demonstrated notable advantages in both editing effectiveness and
efficiency. Despite this, we find that MLBME exhibits suboptimal performance in
low-data scenarios, and its training efficiency is bottlenecked by the
computation of KL divergence. To address these, we propose $\textbf{S}$tep
$\textbf{M}$ore $\textbf{Edit}$ ($\textbf{SMEdit}$), a novel MLBME method that
adopts $\textbf{M}$ultiple $\textbf{B}$ackpro$\textbf{P}$agation
$\textbf{S}$teps ($\textbf{MBPS}$) to improve editing performance under limited
supervision and a norm regularization on weight updates to improve training
efficiency. Experimental results on two datasets and two LLMs demonstrate that
SMEdit outperforms prior MLBME baselines and the MBPS strategy can be
seamlessly integrated into existing methods to further boost their performance.
Our code will be released soon.

*Zechen Li,Baiyu Chen,Hao Xue,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZARA is a zero-shot, explainable HAR framework using raw motion time-series, outperforming baselines by 2.53x in F1 without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HAR methods require retraining for new activities or setups, and LLM-based approaches lack accuracy and interpretability.

Method: ZARA integrates a feature knowledge base, multi-sensor retrieval, and a hierarchical agent pipeline to guide LLMs for predictions and explanations.

Result: ZARA achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, surpassing baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.

Conclusion: ZARA offers flexible, interpretable HAR without fine-tuning, advancing trustworthy motion time-series analysis.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),
with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing
methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when
new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language
models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,
suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose
ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly
from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise
feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every
activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,
and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select
features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and
natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR
without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on
8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering
clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.
Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as
a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.

### [21] [Large Reasoning Models Are Autonomous Jailbreak Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04039)
*Thilo Hagendorff,Erik Derner,Nuria Oliver*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LRMs simplify jailbreaking, making it accessible to non-experts with a 97.14% success rate, revealing alignment regression in AI safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how large reasoning models (LRMs) can bypass AI safety mechanisms, making jailbreaking easier and scalable.

Method: Evaluated four LRMs as autonomous adversaries in multi-turn conversations with nine target models using a benchmark of 70 harmful prompts across seven domains.

Result: Achieved a 97.14% attack success rate, showing LRMs can systematically erode safety guardrails.

Conclusion: Urgent need to align frontier models to resist and prevent jailbreaking, as LRMs can act as jailbreak agents.

Abstract: Jailbreaking -- bypassing built-in safety mechanisms in AI models -- has
traditionally required complex technical procedures or specialized human
expertise. In this study, we show that the persuasive capabilities of large
reasoning models (LRMs) simplify and scale jailbreaking, converting it into an
inexpensive activity accessible to non-experts. We evaluated the capabilities
of four LRMs (DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Grok 3 Mini, Qwen3 235B) to act as
autonomous adversaries conducting multi-turn conversations with nine widely
used target models. LRMs received instructions via a system prompt, before
proceeding to planning and executing jailbreaks with no further supervision. We
performed extensive experiments with a benchmark of harmful prompts composed of
70 items covering seven sensitive domains. This setup yielded an overall attack
success rate across all model combinations of 97.14%. Our study reveals an
alignment regression, in which LRMs can systematically erode the safety
guardrails of other models, highlighting the urgent need to further align
frontier models not only to resist jailbreak attempts, but also to prevent them
from being co-opted into acting as jailbreak agents.

### [22] [DTPA: Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation for Controllable Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04047)
*Jiabing Yang,Yixiang Chen,Zichen Wen,Chenhang Cui,Peiyan Li,Yuan Xu,Bowen Fang,Yan Huang,Liang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the decline in controllability of long-form text generation in CTG, proposing a lightweight framework (DTPA) to dynamically enhance prefix attention and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous CTG studies focus on short sequences, leaving long-form text generation underexplored. The controllability of prefix-based methods like Air-Decoding declines with sequence length due to decaying prefix attention.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA), which selects optimal prefix types and dynamically amplifies prefix attention with an exponentially growing scaling factor. Optionally augments the original prompt for balance.

Result: DTPA outperforms other methods in attribute control while maintaining fluency, diversity, and topic relevance, especially in long text generation.

Conclusion: DTPA effectively addresses the controllability decline in long-form CTG, offering superior performance in attribute control and text quality.

Abstract: Controllable Text Generation (CTG) is a vital subfield in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), aiming to generate text that aligns with desired attributes.
However, previous studies commonly focus on the quality of controllable text
generation for short sequences, while the generation of long-form text remains
largely underexplored. In this paper, we observe that the controllability of
texts generated by the powerful prefix-based method Air-Decoding tends to
decline with increasing sequence length, which we hypothesize primarily arises
from the observed decay in attention to the prefixes. Meanwhile, different
types of prefixes including soft and hard prefixes are also key factors
influencing performance. Building on these insights, we propose a lightweight
and effective framework called Dynamic Token-level Prefix Augmentation (DTPA)
based on Air-Decoding for controllable text generation. Specifically, it first
selects the optimal prefix type for a given task. Then we dynamically amplify
the attention to the prefix for the attribute distribution to enhance
controllability, with a scaling factor growing exponentially as the sequence
length increases. Moreover, based on the task, we optionally apply a similar
augmentation to the original prompt for the raw distribution to balance text
quality. After attribute distribution reconstruction, the generated text
satisfies the attribute constraints well. Experiments on multiple CTG tasks
demonstrate that DTPA generally outperforms other methods in attribute control
while maintaining competitive fluency, diversity, and topic relevance. Further
analysis highlights DTPA's superior effectiveness in long text generation.

*Wang Chen,Guanqiang Qi,Weikang Li,Yang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAIRS is a training-free framework that improves RAG efficiency by adaptively deciding when to retrieve external knowledge and how to select it, reducing retrieval costs by 25% while boosting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems inefficiently retrieve for every query and risk irrelevance. PAIRS aims to optimize retrieval by integrating parametric and external knowledge.

Method: PAIRS uses a dual-path generation mechanism to decide retrieval necessity and employs dual-path retrieval with adaptive selection for divergent cases.

Result: PAIRS reduces retrieval by 25% and improves accuracy (+1.1% EM, +1.0% F1) on QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: PAIRS enhances RAG efficiency and accuracy by intelligently combining parametric and retrieved knowledge.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a cornerstone technique for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However,
current RAG systems face two critical limitations: (1) they inefficiently
retrieve information for every query, including simple questions that could be
resolved using the LLM's parametric knowledge alone, and (2) they risk
retrieving irrelevant documents when queries contain sparse information
signals. To address these gaps, we introduce Parametric-verified Adaptive
Information Retrieval and Selection (PAIRS), a training-free framework that
integrates parametric and retrieved knowledge to adaptively determine whether
to retrieve and how to select external information. Specifically, PAIRS employs
a dual-path generation mechanism: First, the LLM produces both a direct answer
and a context-augmented answer using self-generated pseudo-context. When these
outputs converge, PAIRS bypasses external retrieval entirely, dramatically
improving the RAG system's efficiency. For divergent cases, PAIRS activates a
dual-path retrieval (DPR) process guided by both the original query and
self-generated contextual signals, followed by an Adaptive Information
Selection (AIS) module that filters documents through weighted similarity to
both sources. This simple yet effective approach can not only enhance
efficiency by eliminating unnecessary retrievals but also improve accuracy
through contextually guided retrieval and adaptive information selection.
Experimental results on six question-answering (QA) benchmarks show that PAIRS
reduces retrieval costs by around 25% (triggering for only 75% of queries)
while still improving accuracy-achieving +1.1% EM and +1.0% F1 over prior
baselines on average.

Motivation: Address the computational resource constraints hindering large-scale LLM deployment.

Method: Combines data processing, careful data selection, training strategies, and architectural adjustments, with systematic evaluation of variants.

Result: Developed variants of LLMs were evaluated for capability, versatility, response time, and safety, showing improved efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed strategies effectively enhance LLM efficiency in constrained environments, validated through comparative testing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a milestone in the field of
artificial intelligence and natural language processing. However, their
large-scale deployment remains constrained by the need for significant
computational resources. This work proposes starting from a base model to
explore and combine data processing and careful data selection techniques,
training strategies, and architectural adjustments to improve the efficiency of
LLMs in resource-constrained environments and within a delimited knowledge
base. The methodological approach included defining criteria for building
reliable datasets, conducting controlled experiments with different
configurations, and systematically evaluating the resulting variants in terms
of capability, versatility, response time, and safety. Finally, comparative
tests were conducted to measure the performance of the developed variants and
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies. This work is based on
the master's thesis in Systems and Computer Engineering titled "Efficient
Strategy for Improving the Capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs)".

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolGrad introduces an "answer-first" framework to generate tool-use datasets efficiently, avoiding annotation failures and achieving 100% pass rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods for synthesizing tool-use datasets are inefficient and prone to annotation failures.

Method: ToolGrad constructs valid tool-use chains iteratively using textual "gradients" before generating user queries.

Result: ToolGrad-5k dataset shows higher complexity, lower cost, and 100% pass rate, outperforming baseline datasets and proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: ToolGrad's approach is more efficient and effective for training models, even on out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Abstract: Prior work synthesizes tool-use LLM datasets by first generating a user
query, followed by complex tool-use annotations like DFS. This leads to
inevitable annotation failures and low efficiency in data generation. We
introduce ToolGrad, an agentic framework that inverts this paradigm. ToolGrad
first constructs valid tool-use chains through an iterative process guided by
textual "gradients", and then synthesizes corresponding user queries. This
"answer-first" approach led to ToolGrad-5k, a dataset generated with more
complex tool use, lower cost, and 100% pass rate. Experiments show that models
trained on ToolGrad-5k outperform those on expensive baseline datasets and
proprietary LLMs, even on OOD benchmarks.

*Jianghangfan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Kening Zheng,Xin Zou,Song Dai,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GM-PRM introduces a generative multimodal process reward model that actively corrects errors in reasoning steps, improving solution quality and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal PRMs are limited to binary verification and lack corrective or explanatory capabilities, hindering complex mathematical reasoning.

Method: GM-PRM provides fine-grained analysis of reasoning steps and generates corrections for errors, enabling the Refined-BoN inference strategy.

Result: GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal math benchmarks with high data efficiency (20K-sample dataset).

Conclusion: GM-PRM transforms PRMs into active collaborators, enhancing reasoning accuracy and solution diversity.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities
but often struggle with complex, multi-step mathematical reasoning, where minor
errors in visual perception or logical deduction can lead to complete failure.
While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer step-by-step supervision, existing
multimodal PRMs are limited to being binary verifiers that can identify but not
correct errors, offering little explanatory power. To address these
deficiencies, we introduce the Generative Multimodal Process Reward Model
(GM-PRM), a novel paradigm that transforms the PRM from a passive judge into an
active reasoning collaborator. Instead of a simple scalar score, GM-PRM
provides a fine-grained, interpretable analysis of each reasoning step,
evaluating its step intent, visual alignment, and logical soundness. More
critically, GM-PRM is trained to generate a corrected version of the first
erroneous step it identifies. This unique corrective capability enables our new
test-time inference strategy, Refined Best-of-N (Refined-BoN). This framework
actively enhances solution quality by using the PRM's generated correction to
guide the policy model toward a more promising reasoning trajectory, thereby
improving the diversity and correctness of the solution pool. We demonstrate
that GM-PRM achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple multimodal math
benchmarks, significantly boosting policy model performance with remarkable
data efficiency, requiring only a 20K-sample training dataset. Our code will be
released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: The paper explores over-memorization in finetuned LLMs, where models memorize training data excessively, leading to high test perplexity but good accuracy, while harming robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning, particularly the over-memorization phenomenon and its impact on model performance.

Method: Analyze finetuning dynamics on reasoning tasks, identifying conditions like training epochs and learning rates that cause over-memorization.

Result: Over-memorized models show good accuracy but suffer in robustness, generalization, and diversity. The phenomenon is widespread across tasks and models.

Conclusion: Overparameterized LLMs have unique learning dynamics. Recommendations for checkpoint and learning rate selection are provided to mitigate over-memorization.

Abstract: The pretrained large language models (LLMs) are finetuned with labeled data
for better instruction following ability and alignment with human values. In
this paper, we study the learning dynamics of LLM finetuning on reasoning tasks
and reveal the uncovered over-memorization phenomenon during a specific stage
of LLM finetuning. At this stage, the LLMs have excessively memorized training
data and exhibit high test perplexity while maintaining good test accuracy. We
investigate the conditions that lead to LLM over-memorization and find that
training epochs and large learning rates contribute to this issue. Although
models with over-memorization demonstrate comparable test accuracy to normal
models, they suffer from reduced robustness, poor out-of-distribution
generalization, and decreased generation diversity. Our experiments unveil the
over-memorization to be broadly applicable across different tasks, models, and
finetuning methods. Our research highlights that overparameterized, extensively
finetuned LLMs exhibit unique learning dynamics distinct from traditional
machine learning models. Based on our observations of over-memorization, we
provide recommendations on checkpoint and learning rate selection during
finetuning.

TL;DR: A novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference datasets improves LLM alignment efficiency, outperforming baselines with only 10% of the original data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with human preferences is challenging due to reliance on costly preference datasets, and current methods lack high-quality data selection for preference data.

Method: Introduces a difficulty-based data selection strategy using DPO implicit reward gaps to identify challenging cases, improving data efficiency.

Result: Outperforms five baselines across datasets and tasks, achieving superior performance with 10% of the original data.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, efficient solution for LLM alignment with limited resources.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is a critical
challenge in AI research. While methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) are widely used, they
often rely on large, costly preference datasets. The current work lacks methods
for high-quality data selection specifically for preference data. In this work,
we introduce a novel difficulty-based data selection strategy for preference
datasets, grounded in the DPO implicit reward mechanism. By selecting
preference data examples with smaller DPO implicit reward gaps, which are
indicative of more challenging cases, we improve data efficiency and model
alignment. Our approach consistently outperforms five strong baselines across
multiple datasets and alignment tasks, achieving superior performance with only
10\% of the original data. This principled, efficient selection method offers a
promising solution for scaling LLM alignment with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Human Fooling Rate (HFR) to measure if TTS systems can deceive humans into thinking speech is human-generated. It finds CMOS-based claims often fail, highlights the need for better benchmarks, and shows commercial models outperform open-source ones in zero-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether current TTS systems can genuinely deceive humans in a Turing-like test, moving beyond subjective evaluations like CMOS.

Method: Introduces HFR, a metric for measuring deception, and conducts large-scale evaluations of open-source and commercial TTS models.

Result: CMOS claims often fail under deception testing; commercial models perform better in zero-shot settings, but gaps remain even with fine-tuning.

Conclusion: More realistic, human-centric evaluations are needed alongside existing subjective tests to accurately gauge TTS progress.

Abstract: While subjective evaluations in recent years indicate rapid progress in TTS,
can current TTS systems truly pass a human deception test in a Turing-like
evaluation? We introduce Human Fooling Rate (HFR), a metric that directly
measures how often machine-generated speech is mistaken for human. Our
large-scale evaluation of open-source and commercial TTS models reveals
critical insights: (i) CMOS-based claims of human parity often fail under
deception testing, (ii) TTS progress should be benchmarked on datasets where
human speech achieves high HFRs, as evaluating against monotonous or less
expressive reference samples sets a low bar, (iii) Commercial models approach
human deception in zero-shot settings, while open-source systems still struggle
with natural conversational speech; (iv) Fine-tuning on high-quality data
improves realism but does not fully bridge the gap. Our findings underscore the
need for more realistic, human-centric evaluations alongside existing
subjective tests.

TL;DR: The paper addresses hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by proposing a reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness to improve output consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often generate hallucinations—outputs inconsistent with input—due to failure in capturing causal factors or being misled by non-causal cues.

Method: A reinforcement learning framework is introduced, using token-level causal completeness rewards (considering sufficiency and necessity) within the GRPO optimization framework.

Result: Experiments show the approach effectively reduces hallucinations across benchmark datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully mitigates hallucinations in MLLMs by focusing on causally relevant tokens.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across vision-language tasks. However, they may suffer from
hallucinations--generating outputs that are semantically inconsistent with the
input image or text. Through causal analyses, we find that: (i) hallucinations
with omission may arise from the failure to adequately capture essential causal
factors, and (ii) hallucinations with fabrication are likely caused by the
model being misled by non-causal cues. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel reinforcement learning framework guided by causal completeness, which
jointly considers both causal sufficiency and causal necessity of tokens.
Specifically, we evaluate each token's standalone contribution and
counterfactual indispensability to define a token-level causal completeness
reward. This reward is used to construct a causally informed advantage function
within the GRPO optimization framework, encouraging the model to focus on
tokens that are both causally sufficient and necessary for accurate generation.
Experimental results across various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach, which effectively mitigates hallucinations
in MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper formalizes deep research (DR) tasks, introduces a benchmark (LiveDRBench), and evaluates DR systems, highlighting their reasoning and search challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the scope of deep research tasks and distinguish them from other reasoning-intensive problems, providing a foundation for objective evaluation.

Method: Proposes a formal characterization of DR, defines it using an intermediate output representation, and introduces LiveDRBench with 100 diverse tasks.

Result: Evaluates state-of-the-art DR systems, with OpenAI's model leading (F1 score 0.55). Reveals insights into reasoning traces and search mechanisms.

Conclusion: The benchmark and analysis motivate future improvements in DR systems' search and grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Information tasks such as writing surveys or analytical reports require
complex search and reasoning, and have recently been grouped under the umbrella
of \textit{deep research} -- a term also adopted by recent models targeting
these capabilities. Despite growing interest, the scope of the deep research
task remains underdefined and its distinction from other reasoning-intensive
problems is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose a formal
characterization of the deep research (DR) task and introduce a benchmark to
evaluate the performance of DR systems. We argue that the core defining feature
of deep research is not the production of lengthy report-style outputs, but
rather the high fan-out over concepts required during the search process, i.e.,
broad and reasoning-intensive exploration. To enable objective evaluation, we
define DR using an intermediate output representation that encodes key claims
uncovered during search-separating the reasoning challenge from surface-level
report generation. Based on this formulation, we propose a diverse, challenging
benchmark LiveDRBench with 100 challenging tasks over scientific topics (e.g.,
datasets, materials discovery, prior art search) and public interest events
(e.g., flight incidents, movie awards). Across state-of-the-art DR systems, F1
score ranges between 0.02 and 0.72 for any sub-category. OpenAI's model
performs the best with an overall F1 score of 0.55. Analysis of reasoning
traces reveals the distribution over the number of referenced sources,
branching, and backtracking events executed by current DR systems, motivating
future directions for improving their search mechanisms and grounding
capabilities. The benchmark is available at
https://github.com/microsoft/LiveDRBench.

*Siddhant Panpatil,Hiskias Dingeto,Haon Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: State-of-the-art language models are vulnerable to conversational manipulation, revealing gaps in alignment methods. A manual red-teaming study identified 10 attack scenarios, leading to the creation of MISALIGNMENTBENCH for automated testing. Five models showed a 76% vulnerability rate, with GPT-4.1 most susceptible (90%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To expose vulnerabilities in current alignment techniques of language models, particularly under sophisticated conversational manipulation.

Method: Systematic manual red-teaming with Claude-4-Opus to identify attack scenarios, followed by validation using MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated framework tested across five models.

Result: Discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, with a 76% overall vulnerability rate across models. GPT-4.1 was most susceptible (90%), while Claude-4-Sonnet showed resistance (40%).

Conclusion: Current alignment methods are insufficient against scenario-based manipulation. Future AI systems need improved robustness to handle subtle, context-driven attacks.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in alignment techniques, we demonstrate that
state-of-the-art language models remain vulnerable to carefully crafted
conversational scenarios that can induce various forms of misalignment without
explicit jailbreaking. Through systematic manual red-teaming with
Claude-4-Opus, we discovered 10 successful attack scenarios, revealing
fundamental vulnerabilities in how current alignment methods handle narrative
immersion, emotional pressure, and strategic framing. These scenarios
successfully elicited a range of misaligned behaviors, including deception,
value drift, self-preservation, and manipulative reasoning, each exploiting
different psychological and contextual vulnerabilities. To validate
generalizability, we distilled our successful manual attacks into
MISALIGNMENTBENCH, an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible
testing across multiple models. Cross-model evaluation of our 10 scenarios
against five frontier LLMs revealed an overall 76% vulnerability rate, with
significant variations: GPT-4.1 showed the highest susceptibility (90%), while
Claude-4-Sonnet demonstrated greater resistance (40%). Our findings demonstrate
that sophisticated reasoning capabilities often become attack vectors rather
than protective mechanisms, as models can be manipulated into complex
justifications for misaligned behavior. This work provides (i) a detailed
taxonomy of conversational manipulation patterns and (ii) a reusable evaluation
framework. Together, these findings expose critical gaps in current alignment
strategies and highlight the need for robustness against subtle, scenario-based
manipulation in future AI systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework evaluates LLMs for sentiment analysis in culturally nuanced, low-resource contexts, revealing variability in reasoning quality and the need for culturally sensitive AI evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis in culturally nuanced, low-resource settings challenges conventional NLP methods, requiring context-dependent and culturally embedded approaches.

Method: The study uses human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based explanation evaluation to assess LLMs' interpretability, robustness, and alignment with human reasoning.

Result: Top-tier LLMs show interpretive stability, while open models struggle with ambiguity or sentiment shifts, indicating significant variation in reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Culturally sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation is crucial for complex, real-world communication, as highlighted by the study's findings.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis in low-resource, culturally nuanced contexts challenges
conventional NLP approaches that assume fixed labels and universal affective
expressions. We present a diagnostic framework that treats sentiment as a
context-dependent, culturally embedded construct, and evaluate how large
language models (LLMs) reason about sentiment in informal, code-mixed WhatsApp
messages from Nairobi youth health groups. Using a combination of
human-annotated data, sentiment-flipped counterfactuals, and rubric-based
explanation evaluation, we probe LLM interpretability, robustness, and
alignment with human reasoning. Framing our evaluation through a social-science
measurement lens, we operationalize and interrogate LLMs outputs as an
instrument for measuring the abstract concept of sentiment. Our findings reveal
significant variation in model reasoning quality, with top-tier LLMs
demonstrating interpretive stability, while open models often falter under
ambiguity or sentiment shifts. This work highlights the need for culturally
sensitive, reasoning-aware AI evaluation in complex, real-world communication.

### [34] [ReasoningGuard: Safeguarding Large Reasoning Models with Inference-time Safety Aha Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04204)
*Yuquan Wang,Mi Zhang,Yining Wang,Geng Hong,Xiaoyu You,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReasoningGuard is an inference-time safeguard for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that detects and mitigates harmful content generation during reasoning, outperforming existing methods with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs are vulnerable to harmful content generation during reasoning, and current defenses are costly and lack scalability.

Method: ReasoningGuard uses the model's internal attention to identify critical reasoning points and triggers safety-oriented reflection, combined with a scaling sampling strategy for optimal path selection.

Result: It effectively mitigates three types of jailbreak attacks, outperforming seven existing safeguards with minimal extra inference cost.

Conclusion: ReasoningGuard provides a scalable, efficient solution for safeguarding LRMs without exaggerated safety issues.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
reasoning-intensive tasks, but they remain vulnerable to harmful content
generation, particularly in the mid-to-late steps of their reasoning processes.
Existing defense mechanisms, however, rely on costly fine-tuning and additional
expert knowledge, which restricts their scalability. In this work, we propose
ReasoningGuard, an inference-time safeguard for LRMs, which injects timely
safety aha moments to steer harmless while helpful reasoning processes.
Leveraging the model's internal attention behavior, our approach accurately
identifies critical points in the reasoning path, and triggers spontaneous,
safety-oriented reflection. To safeguard both the subsequent reasoning steps
and the final answers, we further implement a scaling sampling strategy during
the decoding phase, selecting the optimal reasoning path. Inducing minimal
extra inference cost, ReasoningGuard effectively mitigates three types of
jailbreak attacks, including the latest ones targeting the reasoning process of
LRMs. Our approach outperforms seven existing safeguards, achieving
state-of-the-art safety defenses while effectively avoiding the common
exaggerated safety issues.

### [35] [Hierarchical Text Classification Using Black Box Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04219)
*Kosuke Yoshimura,Hisashi Kashima*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using black box LLMs for Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC), comparing three prompting strategies in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Few-shot improves accuracy, and LLMs outperform traditional models on deeper hierarchies, but API costs rise with deeper hierarchies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges of HTC (data scarcity, model complexity) by leveraging LLMs via APIs as an alternative to traditional methods.

Method: Evaluates three prompting strategies (DL, DH, TMH) in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing accuracy and cost-effectiveness on two datasets.

Result: Few-shot improves accuracy; LLMs (especially DH) outperform traditional models on deeper hierarchies, but API costs increase with deeper hierarchies.

Conclusion: Black box LLMs show promise for HTC, but prompt strategy selection must balance performance and cost.

Abstract: Hierarchical Text Classification (HTC) aims to assign texts to structured
label hierarchies; however, it faces challenges due to data scarcity and model
complexity. This study explores the feasibility of using black box Large
Language Models (LLMs) accessed via APIs for HTC, as an alternative to
traditional machine learning methods that require extensive labeled data and
computational resources. We evaluate three prompting strategies -- Direct Leaf
Label Prediction (DL), Direct Hierarchical Label Prediction (DH), and Top-down
Multi-step Hierarchical Label Prediction (TMH) -- in both zero-shot and
few-shot settings, comparing the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of these
strategies. Experiments on two datasets show that a few-shot setting
consistently improves classification accuracy compared to a zero-shot setting.
While a traditional machine learning model achieves high accuracy on a dataset
with a shallow hierarchy, LLMs, especially DH strategy, tend to outperform the
machine learning model on a dataset with a deeper hierarchy. API costs increase
significantly due to the higher input tokens required for deeper label
hierarchies on DH strategy. These results emphasize the trade-off between
accuracy improvement and the computational cost of prompt strategy. These
findings highlight the potential of black box LLMs for HTC while underscoring
the need to carefully select a prompt strategy to balance performance and cost.

*Chanjuan Liu,Shengzhi Wang,Enqiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DP-GPT4MTS introduces a dual-prompt LLM framework to improve time series forecasting by integrating textual context, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional models ignore textual data, limiting accuracy. Multimodal integration via single-prompt frameworks is ineffective due to redundant information.

Method: DP-GPT4MTS uses dual prompts: explicit for task instructions and textual for context-aware embeddings, refined via self-attention and feed-forward networks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on diverse datasets, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: Dual-prompt mechanisms effectively incorporate textual context, enhancing time series prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial in strategic planning and decision-making
across various industries. Traditional forecasting models mainly concentrate on
numerical time series data, often overlooking important textual information
such as events and news, which can significantly affect forecasting accuracy.
While large language models offer a promise for integrating multimodal data,
existing single-prompt frameworks struggle to effectively capture the semantics
of timestamped text, introducing redundant information that can hinder model
performance. To address this limitation, we introduce DP-GPT4MTS (Dual-Prompt
GPT2-base for Multimodal Time Series), a novel dual-prompt large language model
framework that combines two complementary prompts: an explicit prompt for clear
task instructions and a textual prompt for context-aware embeddings from
time-stamped data. The tokenizer generates the explicit prompt while the
embeddings from the textual prompt are refined through self-attention and
feed-forward networks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse
textural-numerical time series datasets demonstrate that this approach
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in time series forecasting. This
highlights the significance of incorporating textual context via a dual-prompt
mechanism to achieve more accurate time series predictions.

*Xi Wang,Anxo Perez,Javier Parapar,Fabio Crestani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel clinician-in-the-loop pipeline, TalkDep, uses advanced language models to simulate diverse and clinically valid patient responses for depression diagnosis training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The shortage of real training data for mental health services limits support for depression diagnosis, prompting the need for better simulated patients.

Method: TalkDep leverages language models, psychiatric criteria, symptom severity scales, and contextual factors to generate authentic patient responses.

Result: Simulated patients are validated by clinical professionals, proving reliable for diagnostic model training.

Conclusion: Validated simulated patients provide a scalable resource to enhance automatic depression diagnosis systems.

Abstract: The increasing demand for mental health services has outpaced the
availability of real training data to develop clinical professionals, leading
to limited support for the diagnosis of depression. This shortage has motivated
the development of simulated or virtual patients to assist in training and
evaluation, but existing approaches often fail to generate clinically valid,
natural, and diverse symptom presentations. In this work, we embrace the recent
advanced language models as the backbone and propose a novel
clinician-in-the-loop patient simulation pipeline, TalkDep, with access to
diversified patient profiles to develop simulated patients. By conditioning the
model on psychiatric diagnostic criteria, symptom severity scales, and
contextual factors, our goal is to create authentic patient responses that can
better support diagnostic model training and evaluation. We verify the
reliability of these simulated patients with thorough assessments conducted by
clinical professionals. The availability of validated simulated patients offers
a scalable and adaptable resource for improving the robustness and
generalisability of automatic depression diagnosis systems.

*Zunhai Su,Kehong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces KVSink, a method to predict and preserve attention sinks during KV cache quantization, improving performance over existing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand and address the limitations of current KV cache quantization techniques, particularly in preserving attention sinks beyond initial tokens.

Method: Examines the role of attention sinks in cross-layer evolution of outliers and introduces KVSink, a plug-and-play method to predict sink tokens with minimal overhead.

Result: KVSink outperforms the Preserve-First-N strategy and enhances KVQuant, improving perplexity and reducing reliance on 16-bit outliers.

Conclusion: KVSink provides a more effective solution for preserving attention sinks during KV cache quantization, advancing efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: Key-Value (KV) cache quantization has become a widely adopted optimization
technique for efficient large language models (LLMs) inference by reducing KV
cache memory usage and mitigating memory-bound constraints. Recent studies have
emphasized the importance of preserving the original precision of KVs for the
first few tokens to ensure the protection of attention sinks. While this
approach has proven effective in mitigating performance degradation, its
underlying principles remain insufficiently understood. Moreover, it fails to
address the recent discovery that attention sinks can emerge beyond the initial
token positions. In this work, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms of
attention sinks during inference by examining their role in the cross-layer
evolution of extreme activation outliers. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of the interplay between attention sinks and KV cache
quantization. Based on our enhanced understanding, we introduce
\textit{\textbf{KVSink}}, a plug-and-play method that effectively predicts sink
tokens with negligible overhead, enabling more thorough preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that KVSink outperforms the existing Preserve-First-N
(PFN) strategy, offering more effective preservation of attention sinks during
KV cache quantization. Moreover, when applied to the well-established KVQuant
method, KVSink further improves perplexity (PPL) and reduces reliance on 16-bit
numerical outliers.

*Jiangyuan Wang,Kejun Xiao,Qi Sun,Huaipeng Zhao,Tao Luo,Jiandong Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShoppingBench is a new e-commerce benchmark for complex user goals, outperforming existing benchmarks. It includes a scalable framework and a large-scale shopping sandbox. Even top agents like GPT-4.1 struggle, but a distilled smaller agent matches its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack coverage of complex user goals in e-commerce, such as voucher application or multi-product searches. ShoppingBench aims to address this gap.

Method: A scalable framework simulates user instructions based on real-world intents. A shopping sandbox with 2.5M products is used for evaluation. Trajectory distillation and fine-tuning are applied to train a smaller agent.

Result: State-of-the-art agents (e.g., GPT-4.1) achieve <50% success. The distilled smaller agent performs competitively with GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: ShoppingBench sets a challenging benchmark for e-commerce tasks, and the proposed distillation method effectively improves smaller agents.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks in e-commerce primarily focus on basic user intents, such
as finding or purchasing products. However, real-world users often pursue more
complex goals, such as applying vouchers, managing budgets, and finding
multi-products seller. To bridge this gap, we propose ShoppingBench, a novel
end-to-end shopping benchmark designed to encompass increasingly challenging
levels of grounded intent. Specifically, we propose a scalable framework to
simulate user instructions based on various intents derived from sampled
real-world products. To facilitate consistent and reliable evaluations, we
provide a large-scale shopping sandbox that serves as an interactive simulated
environment, incorporating over 2.5 million real-world products. Experimental
results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art language agents (such as
GPT-4.1) achieve absolute success rates under 50% on our benchmark tasks,
highlighting the significant challenges posed by our ShoppingBench. In
addition, we propose a trajectory distillation strategy and leverage supervised
fine-tuning, along with reinforcement learning on synthetic trajectories, to
distill the capabilities of a large language agent into a smaller one. As a
result, our trained agent achieves competitive performance compared to GPT-4.1.

### [40] [A Few Words Can Distort Graphs: Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04276)
*Jiayi Wen,Tianxin Chen,Zhirun Zheng,Cheng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphRAG enhances LLMs with structured knowledge graphs but is vulnerable to knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs), which manipulate graph construction to mislead reasoning. Two attacks, TKPA and UKPA, achieve high success rates with minimal text changes, and current defenses fail to detect them.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GraphRAG improves LLM accuracy and explainability but is susceptible to manipulation during graph construction, posing a security risk.

Method: Two attacks are proposed: TKPA (targeted manipulation of vulnerable nodes) and UKPA (disrupting graph integrity via linguistic cues). Both modify minimal text to poison the graph.

Result: TKPA achieves 93.1% success in controlling QA outcomes; UKPA reduces QA accuracy from 95% to 50% with <0.05% text changes. Defenses fail to detect these attacks.

Conclusion: GraphRAG is vulnerable to KPAs, and securing it against such attacks remains an open challenge.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has recently emerged as
a promising paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by converting
raw text into structured knowledge graphs, improving both accuracy and
explainability. However, GraphRAG relies on LLMs to extract knowledge from raw
text during graph construction, and this process can be maliciously manipulated
to implant misleading information. Targeting this attack surface, we propose
two knowledge poisoning attacks (KPAs) and demonstrate that modifying only a
few words in the source text can significantly change the constructed graph,
poison the GraphRAG, and severely mislead downstream reasoning. The first
attack, named Targeted KPA (TKPA), utilizes graph-theoretic analysis to locate
vulnerable nodes in the generated graphs and rewrites the corresponding
narratives with LLMs, achieving precise control over specific
question-answering (QA) outcomes with a success rate of 93.1\%, while keeping
the poisoned text fluent and natural. The second attack, named Universal KPA
(UKPA), exploits linguistic cues such as pronouns and dependency relations to
disrupt the structural integrity of the generated graph by altering globally
influential words. With fewer than 0.05\% of full text modified, the QA
accuracy collapses from 95\% to 50\%. Furthermore, experiments show that
state-of-the-art defense methods fail to detect these attacks, highlighting
that securing GraphRAG pipelines against knowledge poisoning remains largely
unexplored.

TL;DR: MedCheck is a lifecycle-oriented framework for evaluating medical LLM benchmarks, addressing clinical fidelity, data integrity, and safety. It uncovers systemic issues in existing benchmarks and provides actionable guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLMs in healthcare lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety metrics, necessitating a standardized evaluation framework.

Method: MedCheck deconstructs benchmark development into five stages and uses a 46-criteria checklist to evaluate 53 medical LLM benchmarks.

Result: The analysis reveals systemic issues like disconnection from clinical practice, data integrity crises, and neglect of safety-critical metrics.

Conclusion: MedCheck acts as a diagnostic tool and guideline to improve the reliability and transparency of AI evaluations in healthcare.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare,
prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns
persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack
clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation
metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first
lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical
benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five
continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive
checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an
in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis
uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from
clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination
risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like
model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck
serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable
guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to
evaluating AI in healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a new annotation schema for rhetorical roles in scientific literature and evaluates 37 LLMs on a novel benchmark (Sci-Sentence), showing high performance (96% F1) with fine-tuning and benefits from semi-synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI methods for analyzing scientific literature and support automated literature review generation by defining a relevant annotation schema and effective large-scale annotation strategies.

Method: 1) Introduces a novel annotation schema for rhetorical roles. 2) Evaluates 37 LLMs using zero-shot and fine-tuning approaches on the Sci-Sentence benchmark (700 expert-annotated and 2,240 LLM-labelled sentences).

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieve >96% F1. GPT-4o performs best, but lightweight open-source models also excel. Semi-synthetic data boosts performance, especially for small encoders and open decoder models.

Conclusion: The study advances rhetorical role classification, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuned LLMs and the utility of semi-synthetic data, paving the way for automated literature review systems.

Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that AI methods for analysing scientific
literature benefit significantly from annotating sentences in papers according
to their rhetorical roles, such as research gaps, results, limitations,
extensions of existing methodologies, and others. Such representations also
have the potential to support the development of a new generation of systems
capable of producing high-quality literature reviews. However, achieving this
goal requires the definition of a relevant annotation schema and effective
strategies for large-scale annotation of the literature. This paper addresses
these challenges by 1) introducing a novel annotation schema specifically
designed to support literature review generation and 2) conducting a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) in classifying rhetorical roles according to this schema. To this
end, we also present Sci-Sentence, a novel multidisciplinary benchmark
comprising 700 sentences manually annotated by domain experts and 2,240
sentences automatically labelled using LLMs. We evaluate 37 LLMs on this
benchmark, spanning diverse model families and sizes, using both zero-shot
learning and fine-tuning approaches. The experiments yield several novel
insights that advance the state of the art in this challenging domain. First,
the current generation of LLMs performs remarkably well on this task when
fine-tuned on high-quality data, achieving performance levels above 96\% F1.
Second, while large proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve the best results,
some lightweight open-source alternatives also demonstrate excellent
performance. Finally, enriching the training data with semi-synthetic examples
generated by LLMs proves beneficial, enabling small encoders to achieve robust
results and significantly enhancing the performance of several open decoder
models.

*Hongze Tan,Jianfei Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Dynamic Entropy Weighting to improve RL-based LLM reasoning by fine-grained credit assignment via entropy-weighted rewards for tokens and sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like GRPO use uniform rewards for all tokens, limiting performance in long-chain reasoning tasks.

Method: Proposes two methods: GTPO (token-level entropy-weighted rewards) and GRPO-S (sequence-level entropy-weighted rewards).

Result: Outperforms DAPO baseline, showing entropy-weighting boosts reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Dynamic Entropy Weighting enhances deep reasoning in LLMs by refining reward signals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with algorithms like Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) improves Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, but is
limited by a coarse-grained credit assignment that applies a uniform reward to
all tokens in a sequence. This is a major flaw in long-chain reasoning tasks.
This paper solves this with \textbf{Dynamic Entropy Weighting}. Our core idea
is that high-entropy tokens in correct responses can guide the policy toward a
higher performance ceiling. This allows us to create more fine-grained reward
signals for precise policy updates via two ways: 1) \textbf{Group Token Policy
Optimization} (\textbf{GTPO}), we assigns a entropy-weighted reward to each
token for fine-grained credit assignment. 2) \textbf{Sequence-Level Group
Relative Policy Optimization} (\textbf{GRPO-S}), we assigns a entropy-weighted
reward to each sequence based on its average token entropy. Experiments show
our methods significantly outperform the strong DAPO baseline. The results
confirm that our entropy-weighting mechanism is the key driver of this
performance boost, offering a better path to enhance deep reasoning in models.

*Nima Iji,Kia Dashtipour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework to enhance multimodal reasoning in LLMs by dynamically generating targeted questions to activate relevant sensory modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning improvements in LLMs, like chain-of-thought, lack effectiveness in multimodal contexts where models must decide which sensory modalities to engage.

Method: The CoQ framework encourages multimodal LLMs to generate curiosity-driven questions to selectively gather critical information from relevant modalities.

Result: Evaluation on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset shows CoQ improves accuracy, interpretability, and alignment with diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The CoQ framework effectively enhances multimodal reasoning by guiding models to identify and integrate pertinent sensory information.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step
explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to
multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory
modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when
interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce
the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach
that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted
questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the
model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical
information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We
evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by
integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to
effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to
improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process

### [46] [Improving Crash Data Quality with Large Language Models: Evidence from Secondary Crash Narratives in Kentucky](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04399)
*Xu Zhang,Mei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study compares NLP techniques for improving crash data quality, finding fine-tuned transformers like RoBERTa outperform zero-shot LLMs and logistic regression, balancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance crash data quality by leveraging NLP to mine crash narratives, using secondary crash identification as a case study.

Method: Evaluated three model classes: zero-shot LLMs, fine-tuned transformers, and logistic regression, using 16,656 manually reviewed narratives (2015-2022).

Result: Fine-tuned RoBERTa achieved the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy (95%). LLMs showed high recall but had high computational costs.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned transformers offer the best balance of performance and efficiency, with practical deployment strategies for crash-data enhancement.

Abstract: This study evaluates advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
enhance crash data quality by mining crash narratives, using secondary crash
identification in Kentucky as a case study. Drawing from 16,656 manually
reviewed narratives from 2015-2022, with 3,803 confirmed secondary crashes, we
compare three model classes: zero-shot open-source large language models (LLMs)
(LLaMA3:70B, DeepSeek-R1:70B, Qwen3:32B, Gemma3:27B); fine-tuned transformers
(BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, Longformer); and traditional logistic
regression as baseline. Models were calibrated on 2015-2021 data and tested on
1,771 narratives from 2022. Fine-tuned transformers achieved superior
performance, with RoBERTa yielding the highest F1-score (0.90) and accuracy
(95%). Zero-shot LLaMA3:70B reached a comparable F1 of 0.86 but required 139
minutes of inference; the logistic baseline lagged well behind (F1:0.66). LLMs
excelled in recall for some variants (e.g., GEMMA3:27B at 0.94) but incurred
high computational costs (up to 723 minutes for DeepSeek-R1:70B), while
fine-tuned models processed the test set in seconds after brief training.
Further analysis indicated that mid-sized LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1:32B) can
rival larger counterparts in performance while reducing runtime, suggesting
opportunities for optimized deployments. Results highlight trade-offs between
accuracy, efficiency, and data requirements, with fine-tuned transformer models
balancing precision and recall effectively on Kentucky data. Practical
deployment considerations emphasize privacy-preserving local deployment,
ensemble approaches for improved accuracy, and incremental processing for
scalability, providing a replicable scheme for enhancing crash-data quality
with advanced NLP.

### [47] [Why are LLMs' abilities emergent?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04401)
*Vladimír Havlík*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emergent properties in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), arguing that their capabilities arise from complex nonlinear dynamics, not just scaling. It compares these to natural emergent phenomena.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the epistemological challenge of 'creation without understanding' in AI, examining how DNNs' emergent abilities differ from symbolic paradigms.

Method: Combines theoretical analysis and empirical observation of scaling laws, grokking, and phase transitions in DNNs.

Result: Emergent abilities stem from nonlinear dynamics, not just parameter scaling, resembling natural complex systems.

Conclusion: DNNs should be viewed as complex dynamical systems governed by universal emergence principles, shifting focus to internal dynamics over phenomenological definitions.

Abstract: The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.

*Kiyotada Mori,Seiya Kawano,Chaoran Liu,Carlos Toshinori Ishi,Angel Fernando Garcia Contreras,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores human selective listening to improve ASR evaluation for spoken dialogue systems, comparing human and reference transcriptions to identify gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance ASR capabilities in SDSs by understanding human selective listening and its role in response generation.

Method: Experimental comparison of human transcriptions for dialogue responses and reference transcriptions to confirm selective listening.

Result: Confirmed human selective listening during dialogue response generation, highlighting gaps between ASR and human transcription abilities.

Conclusion: Proposes a new ASR evaluation method leveraging human selective listening to bridge the gap between ASR systems and humans.

Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) utilize automatic speech recognition (ASR) at
the front end of their pipeline. The role of ASR in SDSs is to recognize
information in user speech related to response generation appropriately.
Examining selective listening of humans, which refers to the ability to focus
on and listen to important parts of a conversation during the speech, will
enable us to identify the ASR capabilities required for SDSs and evaluate them.
In this study, we experimentally confirmed selective listening when humans
generate dialogue responses by comparing human transcriptions for generating
dialogue responses and reference transcriptions. Based on our experimental
results, we discuss the possibility of a new ASR evaluation method that
leverages human selective listening, which can identify the gap between
transcription ability between ASR systems and humans.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Prediction Confidence Model (PCM) to reduce user-perceived latency in dialogue systems by estimating semantic similarity between predicted and actual user utterances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To minimize user waiting time (UPL) in spoken dialogue systems by prefetching responses based on accurate predictions of user utterances.

Method: Developed a PCM to assess semantic similarity between predicted and actual user utterances, determining if prefetching is feasible.

Result: Evaluated PCM performance by comparing predicted and actual user utterances.

Conclusion: The PCM effectively aids in reducing UPL by improving the accuracy of prefetching decisions.

Abstract: Prefetching of dialogue responses has been investigated to reduce
user-perceived latency (UPL), which refers to the user's waiting time before
receiving the system's response, in spoken dialogue systems. To reduce the UPL,
it is necessary to predict complete user utterances before the end of the
user's speech, typically by language models, to prepare prefetched dialogue
responses. In this study, we proposed a prediction confidence model (PCM) that
determines whether prefetching is possible or not by estimating the semantic
similarity between the predicted complete user utterance and the complete user
utterance. We evaluated our PCM based on the differences between the predicted
complete user utterance and the complete user utterance.

*Jie Zhu,Huaixia Dou,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Customer Support Conversation (CSC) task, proposing a structured framework and datasets (CSConv and RoleCS) to train customer service agents using LLMs for high-quality, strategy-aligned responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dialogue datasets lack strategic guidance, and real-world service data is hard to access and annotate, necessitating a structured approach for effective customer support.

Method: A CSC framework is proposed, defining conversational stages and strategies. CSConv (evaluation dataset) and RoleCS (training dataset) are created using LLMs. A role-playing approach simulates strategy-rich conversations.

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on RoleCS improves strategy-aligned responses on CSConv, with human evaluations confirming better problem resolution.

Conclusion: The CSC framework and datasets enhance customer support training, demonstrating the effectiveness of LLMs in generating high-quality, strategy-aligned responses.

Abstract: Effective customer support requires not only accurate problem solving but
also structured and empathetic communication aligned with professional
standards. However, existing dialogue datasets often lack strategic guidance,
and real-world service data is difficult to access and annotate. To address
this, we introduce the task of Customer Support Conversation (CSC), aimed at
training customer service agents to respond using well-defined support
strategies. We propose a structured CSC framework grounded in COPC guidelines,
defining five conversational stages and twelve strategies to guide high-quality
interactions. Based on this, we construct CSConv, an evaluation dataset of
1,855 real-world customer-agent conversations rewritten using LLMs to reflect
deliberate strategy use, and annotated accordingly. Additionally, we develop a
role-playing approach that simulates strategy-rich conversations using
LLM-powered roles aligned with the CSC framework, resulting in the training
dataset RoleCS. Experiments show that fine-tuning strong LLMs on RoleCS
significantly improves their ability to generate high-quality, strategy-aligned
responses on CSConv. Human evaluations further confirm gains in problem
resolution. All code and data will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Autoformalization translates natural-language math into formal language. ThinkingF, a new pipeline, improves accuracy by enhancing formal knowledge and reasoning, achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoformalization methods lack accuracy due to insufficient formal knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

Method: ThinkingF combines two datasets (formal knowledge-rich and reasoning-guided) and uses SFT and RLVR for training.

Result: StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores: 40.5% on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench.

Conclusion: ThinkingF effectively bridges gaps in autoformalization, outperforming prior models.

Abstract: Autoformalization aims to translate natural-language mathematical statements
into a formal language. While LLMs have accelerated progress in this area,
existing methods still suffer from low accuracy. We identify two key abilities
for effective autoformalization: comprehensive mastery of formal-language
domain knowledge, and reasoning capability of natural language problem
understanding and informal-formal alignment. Without the former, a model cannot
identify the correct formal objects; without the latter, it struggles to
interpret real-world contexts and map them precisely into formal expressions.
To address these gaps, we introduce ThinkingF, a data synthesis and training
pipeline that improves both abilities. First, we construct two datasets: one by
distilling and selecting large-scale examples rich in formal knowledge, and
another by generating informal-to-formal reasoning trajectories guided by
expert-designed templates. We then apply SFT and RLVR with these datasets to
further fuse and refine the two abilities. The resulting 7B and 32B models
exhibit both comprehensive formal knowledge and strong informal-to-formal
reasoning. Notably, StepFun-Formalizer-32B achieves SOTA BEq@1 scores of 40.5%
on FormalMATH-Lite and 26.7% on ProverBench, surpassing all prior
general-purpose and specialized models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores using Generative AI (GPT-4o) to create scalable, high-quality educational MCQs in Bahasa Melayu, comparing four methods (non-grounded prompting and RAG-based). RAG methods outperform, ensuring better curriculum alignment and factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the need for scalable, quality educational tools in Malaysia, especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu, while tackling challenges of factual accuracy and curriculum alignment.

Method: Four pipelines for MCQ generation: non-grounded prompting (structured/basic) and RAG-based (LangChain/manual). Uses curriculum documents for grounding and employs STS and RAG-QA for evaluation.

Result: RAG-based pipelines outperform non-grounded methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and factual validity.

Conclusion: Validates a methodology for curriculum-specific content generation in low-resource languages, introduces RAG-QA evaluation, and offers insights for EdTech solutions in similar regions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for scalable and high-quality
educational assessment tools within the Malaysian education system. It
highlights the potential of Generative AI (GenAI) while acknowledging the
significant challenges of ensuring factual accuracy and curriculum alignment,
especially for low-resource languages like Bahasa Melayu. This research
introduces and compares four incremental pipelines for generating Form 1
Mathematics multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Bahasa Melayu using OpenAI's
GPT-4o. The methods range from non-grounded prompting (structured and basic) to
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches (one using the LangChain
framework, one implemented manually). The system is grounded in official
curriculum documents, including teacher-prepared notes and the yearly teaching
plan (RPT). A dual-pronged automated evaluation framework is employed to assess
the generated questions. Curriculum alignment is measured using Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) against the RPT, while contextual validity is verified
through a novel RAG-based Question-Answering (RAG-QA) method. The results
demonstrate that RAG-based pipelines significantly outperform non-grounded
prompting methods, producing questions with higher curriculum alignment and
factual validity. The study further analyzes the trade-offs between the ease of
implementation of framework-based RAG and the fine-grained control offered by a
manual pipeline. This work presents a validated methodology for generating
curriculum-specific educational content in a low-resource language, introduces
a symbiotic RAG-QA evaluation technique, and provides actionable insights for
the development and deployment of practical EdTech solutions in Malaysia and
similar regions.

*Bastien Liétard,Gabriel Loiseau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Concept Differentiation, an extension to Word-in-Context, to include inter-word scenarios, and proposes Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE) for improved lexical semantic representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like XL-LEXEME are limited to comparing occurrences of the same lemma, missing inter-word semantic relations.

Method: Proposes Concept Differentiation, creates a dataset from SemCor, and fine-tunes models (CALE) on it.

Result: CALE achieves best performance in lexical semantic tasks and improves embedding spatial organization.

Conclusion: CALE provides efficient multi-purpose lexical representations, enhancing semantic accuracy.

Abstract: Lexical semantics is concerned with both the multiple senses a word can adopt
in different contexts, and the semantic relations that exist between meanings
of different words. To investigate them, Contextualized Language Models are a
valuable tool that provides context-sensitive representations that can be used
to investigate lexical meaning. Recent works like XL-LEXEME have leveraged the
task of Word-in-Context to fine-tune them to get more semantically accurate
representations, but Word-in-Context only compares occurrences of the same
lemma, limiting the range of captured information. In this paper, we propose an
extension, Concept Differentiation, to include inter-words scenarios. We
provide a dataset for this task, derived from SemCor data. Then we fine-tune
several representation models on this dataset. We call these models
Concept-Aligned Embeddings (CALE). By challenging our models and other models
on various lexical semantic tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed models
provide efficient multi-purpose representations of lexical meaning that reach
best performances in our experiments. We also show that CALE's fine-tuning
brings valuable changes to the spatial organization of embeddings.

*Chenglei Shen,Zhongxiang Sun,Teng Shi,Xiao Zhang,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StyliTruth addresses the trade-off between style and truthfulness in LLM responses by separating style and truth subspaces, enabling independent control and better balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for stylized LLM responses degrade truthfulness due to latent coupling between style and truth directions in key attention heads.

Method: StyliTruth uses orthogonal deflation to separate style and truth subspaces, with adaptive token-level steering vectors for precise control.

Result: Experiments show StyliTruth reduces truthfulness collapse and outperforms existing methods in balancing style and truth.

Conclusion: StyliTruth effectively preserves both stylization and truthfulness in LLM responses.

Abstract: Generating stylized large language model (LLM) responses via representation
editing is a promising way for fine-grained output control. However, there
exists an inherent trade-off: imposing a distinctive style often degrades
truthfulness. Existing representation editing methods, by naively injecting
style signals, overlook this collateral impact and frequently contaminate the
model's core truthfulness representations, resulting in reduced answer
correctness. We term this phenomenon stylization-induced truthfulness collapse.
We attribute this issue to latent coupling between style and truth directions
in certain key attention heads, and propose StyliTruth, a mechanism that
preserves stylization while keeping truthfulness intact. StyliTruth separates
the style-relevant and truth-relevant subspaces in the model's representation
space via an orthogonal deflation process. This decomposition enables
independent control of style and truth in their own subspaces, minimizing
interference. By designing adaptive, token-level steering vectors within each
subspace, we dynamically and precisely control the generation process to
maintain both stylistic fidelity and truthfulness. We validate our method on
multiple styles and languages. Extensive experiments and analyses show that
StyliTruth significantly reduces stylization-induced truthfulness collapse and
outperforms existing inference-time intervention methods in balancing style
adherence with truthfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces C-MIND, a clinical dataset for depression assessment, analyzes behavioral signatures, evaluates model performance, and improves LLM diagnostic accuracy with clinical expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in automated depression assessment by using clinically validated data and focusing on real-world effectiveness.

Method: Introduces C-MIND dataset, analyzes behavioral signatures, evaluates classical models, and enhances LLM performance with clinical guidance.

Result: Clinical expertise improves LLM diagnostic performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for reliable clinical depression assessment through data and algorithmic advancements.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.
While automated depression assessment shows promise, most studies rely on
limited or non-clinically validated data, and often prioritize complex model
design over real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we aim to unveil the
landscape of clinical depression assessment. We introduce C-MIND, a clinical
neuropsychiatric multimodal diagnosis dataset collected over two years from
real hospital visits. Each participant completes three structured psychiatric
tasks and receives a final diagnosis from expert clinicians, with informative
audio, video, transcript, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)
signals recorded. Using C-MIND, we first analyze behavioral signatures relevant
to diagnosis. We train a range of classical models to quantify how different
tasks and modalities contribute to diagnostic performance, and dissect the
effectiveness of their combinations. We then explore whether LLMs can perform
psychiatric reasoning like clinicians and identify their clear limitations in
realistic clinical settings. In response, we propose to guide the reasoning
process with clinical expertise and consistently improves LLM diagnostic
performance by up to 10% in Macro-F1 score. We aim to build an infrastructure
for clinical depression assessment from both data and algorithmic perspectives,
enabling C-MIND to facilitate grounded and reliable research for mental
healthcare.

TL;DR: Multi-agent discussions outperform solitary ideation in generating research proposals, with cognitive diversity and expertise being key factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore if structured multi-agent discussions can enhance creativity in scientific ideation compared to single-agent approaches.

Method: Proposes a cooperative multi-agent framework, testing configurations like group size, leadership, and team composition, evaluated via agent-based scoring and human review.

Result: Multi-agent discussions significantly outperform solitary ideation, with leadership and cognitive diversity improving proposal quality, while expertise is essential.

Conclusion: Multi-agent ideation systems benefit from cognitive diversity and leadership, but require foundational expertise for optimal performance.

Abstract: While AI agents show potential in scientific ideation, most existing
frameworks rely on single-agent refinement, limiting creativity due to bounded
knowledge and perspective. Inspired by real-world research dynamics, this paper
investigates whether structured multi-agent discussions can surpass solitary
ideation. We propose a cooperative multi-agent framework for generating
research proposals and systematically compare configurations including group
size, leaderled versus leaderless structures, and team compositions varying in
interdisciplinarity and seniority. To assess idea quality, we employ a
comprehensive protocol with agent-based scoring and human review across
dimensions such as novelty, strategic vision, and integration depth. Our
results show that multi-agent discussions substantially outperform solitary
baselines. A designated leader acts as a catalyst, transforming discussion into
more integrated and visionary proposals. Notably, we find that cognitive
diversity is a primary driver of quality, yet expertise is a non-negotiable
prerequisite, as teams lacking a foundation of senior knowledge fail to surpass
even a single competent agent. These findings offer actionable insights for
designing collaborative AI ideation systems and shed light on how team
structure influences creative outcomes.

*Magauiya Zhussip,Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MASA introduces structured weight sharing across transformer layers to reduce parameters by 66.7% without performance loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory demands of LLMs limit deployment; inter-block redundancy in transformers is underexplored.

Method: Decomposes attention projection matrices into shared dictionary atoms, enabling weight sharing across layers as a drop-in replacement.

Result: Achieves better accuracy and perplexity than baselines, with 66.7% fewer parameters; extends successfully to Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: MASA provides a scalable, parameter-efficient solution for transformers without performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
high computational and memory demands hinder their widespread deployment.
Existing compression techniques focus on intra-block optimizations (e.g.
low-rank approximation, attention head pruning), while the repetitive layered
structure of transformers implies significant inter-block redundancy - a
dimension largely unexplored beyond key-value (KV) caching. Inspired by
dictionary learning in CNNs, we propose a framework for structured weight
sharing across transformer layers. Our approach decomposes attention projection
matrices into shared dictionary atoms, reducing the attention module's
parameters by 66.7% while achieving on-par performance. Unlike complex methods
requiring distillation or architectural changes, MASA (Matrix Atom Sharing in
Attention) operates as a drop-in replacement - trained with standard optimizers
- and represents each layer's weights as linear combinations of shared matrix
atoms. Experiments across scales (100M-700M parameters) show that MASA achieves
better benchmark accuracy and perplexity than grouped-query attention (GQA),
low-rank baselines and recently proposed Repeat-all-over/Sequential sharing at
comparable parameter budgets. Ablation studies confirm robustness to the
dictionary size and the efficacy of shared representations in capturing
cross-layer statistical regularities. Extending to Vision Transformers (ViT),
MASA matches performance metrics on image classification and detection tasks
with 66.7% fewer attention parameters. By combining dictionary learning
strategies with transformer efficiency, MASA offers a scalable blueprint for
parameter-efficient models without sacrificing performance. Finally, we
investigate the possibility of employing MASA on pretrained LLMs to reduce
their number of parameters without experiencing any significant drop in their
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TURA introduces a three-stage framework combining RAG with agentic tool-use to bridge static and dynamic information gaps in AI search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG struggles with real-time needs and structured queries, limiting search engines to static content.

Method: TURA uses Intent-Aware Retrieval, DAG-based Task Planner, and Distilled Agent Executor to access static and dynamic sources.

Result: TURA serves millions, delivering real-time answers while meeting low-latency industrial demands.

Conclusion: TURA systematically bridges static RAG and dynamic sources, enhancing AI search capabilities.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming search engines
into conversational AI search products, primarily using Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) on web corpora. However, this paradigm has significant
industrial limitations. Traditional RAG approaches struggle with real-time
needs and structured queries that require accessing dynamically generated
content like ticket availability or inventory. Limited to indexing static
pages, search engines cannot perform the interactive queries needed for such
time-sensitive data. Academic research has focused on optimizing RAG for static
content, overlooking complex intents and the need for dynamic sources like
databases and real-time APIs. To bridge this gap, we introduce TURA
(Tool-Augmented Unified Retrieval Agent for AI Search), a novel three-stage
framework that combines RAG with agentic tool-use to access both static content
and dynamic, real-time information. TURA has three key components: an
Intent-Aware Retrieval module to decompose queries and retrieve information
sources encapsulated as Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, a DAG-based Task
Planner that models task dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for
optimal parallel execution, and a lightweight Distilled Agent Executor for
efficient tool calling. TURA is the first architecture to systematically bridge
the gap between static RAG and dynamic information sources for a world-class AI
search product. Serving tens of millions of users, it leverages an agentic
framework to deliver robust, real-time answers while meeting the low-latency
demands of a large-scale industrial system.

Conclusion: Compact transformers like T5-Small are promising for text-to-SQL in low-resource settings, with potential for future enhancements.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL translation enables non-expert users to query relational
databases using natural language, with applications in education and business
intelligence. This study evaluates three lightweight transformer models -
T5-Small, BART-Small, and GPT-2 - on the Spider dataset, focusing on
low-resource settings. We developed a reusable, model-agnostic pipeline that
tailors schema formatting to each model's architecture, training them across
1000 to 5000 iterations and evaluating on 1000 test samples using Logical Form
Accuracy (LFAcc), BLEU, and Exact Match (EM) metrics. Fine-tuned T5-Small
achieves the highest LFAcc (27.8%), outperforming BART-Small (23.98%) and GPT-2
(20.1%), highlighting encoder-decoder models' superiority in schema-aware SQL
generation. Despite resource constraints limiting performance, our pipeline's
modularity supports future enhancements, such as advanced schema linking or
alternative base models. This work underscores the potential of compact
transformers for accessible text-to-SQL solutions in resource-scarce
environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: P-Aligner is a lightweight module that improves LLM instruction alignment by generating human-preferred forms of instructions, trained on the UltraPrompt dataset, outperforming baselines significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often fail to align with safe, helpful, and honest values when given flawed instructions, requiring a cost-effective solution for better alignment.

Method: P-Aligner, a lightweight module, is trained on UltraPrompt, a dataset synthesized via a principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree Search to explore human-preferred instructions.

Result: P-Aligner outperforms baselines, achieving average win-rate gains of 28.35% on GPT-4-turbo and 8.69% on Gemma-2-SimPO.

Conclusion: P-Aligner effectively and efficiently aligns LLM instructions with human preferences, validated through multiple analyses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to produce safe, helpful, and
honest content during interaction with human users, but they frequently fail to
align with such values when given flawed instructions, e.g., missing context,
ambiguous directives, or inappropriate tone, leaving substantial room for
improvement along multiple dimensions. A cost-effective yet high-impact way is
to pre-align instructions before the model begins decoding. Existing approaches
either rely on prohibitive test-time search costs or end-to-end model rewrite,
which is powered by a customized training corpus with unclear objectives. In
this work, we demonstrate that the goal of efficient and effective preference
alignment can be achieved by P-Aligner, a lightweight module generating
instructions that preserve the original intents while being expressed in a more
human-preferred form. P-Aligner is trained on UltraPrompt, a new dataset
synthesized via a proposed principle-guided pipeline using Monte-Carlo Tree
Search, which systematically explores the space of candidate instructions that
are closely tied to human preference. Experiments across different methods show
that P-Aligner generally outperforms strong baselines across various models and
benchmarks, including average win-rate gains of 28.35% and 8.69% on GPT-4-turbo
and Gemma-2-SimPO, respectively. Further analyses validate its effectiveness
and efficiency through multiple perspectives, including data quality, search
strategies, iterative deployment, and time overhead.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLVR improves LLM instruction-following but faces inefficiency and over-optimization. IFDecorator introduces a robust pipeline with cooperative-adversarial data, IntentCheck, and trip wires, achieving high accuracy and reducing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address training inefficiency and over-optimization in RLVR for LLMs, ensuring better alignment with user intent.

Method: IFDecorator framework with cooperative-adversarial data flywheel, IntentCheck, and trip wires for detecting reward hacking.

Result: 87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming GPT-4o, and reduced reward hacking rates.

Conclusion: IFDecorator enhances RLVR efficiency and robustness, with potential for future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) improves instruction
following capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from
training inefficiency due to inadequate difficulty assessment. Moreover, RLVR
is prone to over-optimization, where LLMs exploit verification shortcuts
without aligning to the actual intent of user instructions. We introduce
Instruction Following Decorator (IFDecorator}, a framework that wraps RLVR
training into a robust and sample-efficient pipeline. It consists of three
components: (1) a cooperative-adversarial data flywheel that co-evolves
instructions and hybrid verifications, generating progressively more
challenging instruction-verification pairs; (2) IntentCheck, a bypass module
enforcing intent alignment; and (3) trip wires, a diagnostic mechanism that
detects reward hacking via trap instructions, which trigger and capture
shortcut exploitation behaviors. Our Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-IFDecorator achieves
87.43% accuracy on IFEval, outperforming larger proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Additionally, we demonstrate substantial improvements on FollowBench
while preserving general capabilities. Our trip wires show significant
reductions in reward hacking rates. We will release models, code, and data for
future research.

*Tanvi Dinkar,Aiqi Jiang,Simona Frenda,Poppy Gerrard-Abbott,Nancie Gunson,Gavin Abercrombie,Ioannis Konstas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reviews 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, highlighting a shift from stakeholder collaboration to automated pipelines, and identifies a disconnect between research and community needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To analyze the influence of stakeholder participation in counterspeech research and address the gap between NLP research and impacted communities.

Method: Conducted a systematic review of 74 NLP studies and a participatory case study with five NGOs specializing in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV).

Result: Found a growing disconnect between NLP research and community needs, with stakeholder input often lacking in dataset creation and model development.

Conclusion: Recommends recentering stakeholder expertise in counterspeech research to better address real-world needs.

Abstract: Counterspeech, i.e. the practice of responding to online hate speech, has
gained traction in NLP as a promising intervention. While early work emphasised
collaboration with non-governmental organisation stakeholders, recent research
trends have shifted toward automated pipelines that reuse a small set of legacy
datasets, often without input from affected communities. This paper presents a
systematic review of 74 NLP studies on counterspeech, analysing the extent to
which stakeholder participation influences dataset creation, model development,
and evaluation. To complement this analysis, we conducted a participatory case
study with five NGOs specialising in online Gender-Based Violence (oGBV),
identifying stakeholder-informed practices for counterspeech generation. Our
findings reveal a growing disconnect between current NLP research and the needs
of communities most impacted by toxic online content. We conclude with concrete
recommendations for re-centring stakeholder expertise in counterspeech
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mmGRPO extends GRPO for multi-module AI systems, improving accuracy by 11% over post-trained LMs and 5% over prompt optimization alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems now use modular programs with multiple LM calls, requiring adaptation of GRPO for such setups.

Method: mmGRPO groups LM calls by module, handles variable-length trajectories, and integrates with prompt optimization.

Result: mmGRPO boosts accuracy by 11% on tasks like classification and search compared to post-trained LMs, and 5% over standalone prompt optimization.

Conclusion: mmGRPO, integrated into DSPy, effectively enhances modular AI systems, offering significant performance gains.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has proven to be an effective tool
for post-training language models (LMs). However, AI systems are increasingly
expressed as modular programs that mix together multiple LM calls with distinct
prompt templates and other tools, and it is not clear how best to leverage GRPO
to improve these systems. We begin to address this challenge by defining
mmGRPO, a simple multi-module generalization of GRPO that groups LM calls by
module across rollouts and handles variable-length and interrupted
trajectories. We find that mmGRPO, composed with automatic prompt optimization,
improves accuracy by 11% on average across classification, many-hop search, and
privacy-preserving delegation tasks against the post-trained LM, and by 5%
against prompt optimization on its own. We open-source mmGRPO in DSPy as the
dspy.GRPO optimizer.

### [64] [Sculptor: Empowering LLMs with Cognitive Agency via Active Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04664)
*Mo Li,L. H. Xu,Qitai Tan,Ting Cao,Yunxin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sculptor introduces Active Context Management (ACM) tools to help LLMs manage long contexts, improving performance by mitigating proactive interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs degrade in performance with long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant early information disrupts reasoning.

Method: Sculptor equips LLMs with ACM tools: context fragmentation, summary/hide/restore, and intelligent search, enabling proactive attention management.

Result: Sculptor improves performance on benchmarks (PI-LLM, NeedleBench) without specific training, leveraging LLMs' tool-calling generalization.

Conclusion: Explicit context-control strategies, like ACM, are key to robust long-context reasoning, not just larger token windows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from significant performance degradation
when processing long contexts due to proactive interference, where irrelevant
information in earlier parts of the context disrupts reasoning and memory
recall. While most research focuses on external memory systems to augment LLMs'
capabilities, we propose a complementary approach: empowering LLMs with Active
Context Management (ACM) tools to actively sculpt their internal working
memory. We introduce Sculptor, a framework that equips LLMs with three
categories of tools: (1) context fragmentation, (2) summary, hide, and restore,
and (3) intelligent search. Our approach enables LLMs to proactively manage
their attention and working memory, analogous to how humans selectively focus
on relevant information while filtering out distractions. Experimental
evaluation on information-sparse benchmarks-PI-LLM (proactive interference) and
NeedleBench Multi-Needle Reasoning-demonstrates that Sculptor significantly
improves performance even without specific training, leveraging LLMs' inherent
tool calling generalization capabilities. By enabling Active Context
Management, Sculptor not only mitigates proactive interference but also
provides a cognitive foundation for more reliable reasoning across diverse
long-context tasks-highlighting that explicit context-control strategies,
rather than merely larger token windows, are key to robustness at scale.

### [65] [GeRe: Towards Efficient Anti-Forgetting in Continual Learning of LLM via General Samples Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04676)
*Yunan Zhang,Shuoran Jiang,Mengchen Zhao,Yuefeng Li,Yang Fan,Xiangping Wu,Qingcai Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes General Sample Replay (GeRe) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for LLMs, using pretraining texts and a threshold-based margin loss for activation state consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual fine-tuning of LLMs, which harms general capabilities and task performance.

Method: Introduces GeRe with a threshold-based margin (TM) loss to maintain activation state consistency during replay learning.

Result: A small set of general replay samples resolves forgetting and improves performance; TM outperforms other replay strategies.

Conclusion: GeRe with TM loss efficiently mitigates forgetting and enhances LLM continual learning.

Abstract: The continual learning capability of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for advancing artificial general intelligence. However, continual fine-tuning
LLMs across various domains often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
characterized by: 1) significant forgetting of their general capabilities, and
2) sharp performance declines in previously learned tasks. To simultaneously
address both issues in a simple yet stable manner, we propose General Sample
Replay (GeRe), a framework that use usual pretraining texts for efficient
anti-forgetting. Beyond revisiting the most prevalent replay-based practices
under GeRe, we further leverage neural states to introduce a enhanced
activation states constrained optimization method using threshold-based margin
(TM) loss, which maintains activation state consistency during replay learning.
We are the first to validate that a small, fixed set of pre-collected general
replay samples is sufficient to resolve both concerns--retaining general
capabilities while promoting overall performance across sequential tasks.
Indeed, the former can inherently facilitate the latter. Through controlled
experiments, we systematically compare TM with different replay strategies
under the GeRe framework, including vanilla label fitting, logit imitation via
KL divergence and feature imitation via L1/L2 losses. Results demonstrate that
TM consistently improves performance and exhibits better robustness. Our work
paves the way for efficient replay of LLMs for the future. Our code and data
are available at https://github.com/Qznan/GeRe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses the challenge of personalizing LLM-powered conversational assistants with limited user preference data (PPALLI), introduces two datasets (DnD and ELIP), benchmarks alignment techniques, and proposes FaST, a parameter-efficient method with top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-powered assistants lack personalization, failing to align with individual user preferences. The work focuses on addressing this gap with limited user data.

Method: The study introduces two datasets (DnD and ELIP) and benchmarks alignment techniques. It proposes FaST, a parameter-efficient method leveraging high-level features from data.

Result: FaST achieves the best overall performance in aligning LLMs with user preferences using limited data.

Conclusion: The work advances LLM personalization by addressing PPALLI, introducing datasets, and proposing FaST as an effective solution.

Abstract: LLM-powered conversational assistants are often deployed in a
one-size-fits-all manner, which fails to accommodate individual user
preferences. Recently, LLM personalization -- tailoring models to align with
specific user preferences -- has gained increasing attention as a way to bridge
this gap. In this work, we specifically focus on a practical yet challenging
setting where only a small set of preference annotations can be collected per
user -- a problem we define as Personalized Preference Alignment with Limited
Data (PPALLI). To support research in this area, we introduce two datasets --
DnD and ELIP -- and benchmark a variety of alignment techniques on them. We
further propose FaST, a highly parameter-efficient approach that leverages
high-level features automatically discovered from the data, achieving the best
overall performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why reasoning models hallucinate more than general language models, focusing on multi-hop question answering. It introduces a framework to categorize errors by source diversity, information coverage, and cognitive inefficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reasoning failures of language models in multi-hop tasks and uncover hidden error patterns beyond accuracy metrics.

Method: A novel error categorization framework is developed, supported by human annotation and automated metrics, to analyze failures across three dimensions: source diversity, information coverage, and cognitive inefficiency.

Result: The study reveals intricate error patterns in reasoning models, providing insights into their cognitive limitations.

Conclusion: The findings offer actionable guidance to improve reasoning fidelity, transparency, and robustness in future language models.

Abstract: The emergence of reasoning models and their integration into practical AI
chat bots has led to breakthroughs in solving advanced math, deep search, and
extractive question answering problems that requires a complex and multi-step
thought process. Yet, a complete understanding of why these models hallucinate
more than general purpose language models is missing. In this investigative
study, we systematicallyexplore reasoning failures of contemporary language
models on multi-hop question answering tasks. We introduce a novel, nuanced
error categorization framework that examines failures across three critical
dimensions: the diversity and uniqueness of source documents involved ("hops"),
completeness in capturing relevant information ("coverage"), and cognitive
inefficiency ("overthinking"). Through rigorous hu-man annotation, supported by
complementary automated metrics, our exploration uncovers intricate error
patterns often hidden by accuracy-centric evaluations. This investigative
approach provides deeper insights into the cognitive limitations of current
models and offers actionable guidance toward enhancing reasoning fidelity,
transparency, and robustness in future language modeling efforts.

### [68] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate VR training content creation, reducing development time and enhancing scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR training is effective but resource-intensive to develop; automating content creation addresses this challenge.

Method: A two-component system: an LLM extracts task details from text, and an intelligent module converts this into VR animations and visual cues.

Result: Automated VR instruction generation improves training effectiveness and reduces development overhead.

Conclusion: The approach makes VR training more scalable and adaptable to industrial needs.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD) algorithm to improve circle fitting accuracy by detecting and removing noisy points in polar coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy point sets compromise circle fitting effectiveness, necessitating robust outlier detection methods for industrial applications like quality control.

Method: The PCOD algorithm transforms points into polar coordinates, calculates local and global standard deviations, and identifies outliers by comparing local means with global deviations.

Result: PCOD outperforms ten circle fitting algorithms and five outlier detection methods, achieving the highest accuracy in industrial washer part measurements.

Conclusion: PCOD enhances circle fitting accuracy in noisy environments, proving its potential for industrial applications.

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes two methods (conversion factor-based and pixel-based) to improve measurement accuracy in camera systems, reducing errors from 13-114 µm to 1-2 µm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measurement errors in camera systems persist despite specialized equipment, especially when measuring parts of varying diameters.

Method: Two approaches: (1) conversion factor estimation from known references, and (2) direct pixel-based diameter estimation.

Result: Errors reduced from 13-114 µm to 1-2 µm in tests on glass and metal samples.

Conclusion: The methods significantly enhance accuracy and reliability in diameter measurements using minimal reference parts.

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Method: Uses Gemini for modality-separable reasoning traces and introduces Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning for balanced inter/intra-class distributions.

Result: Substantial performance improvements on the MER2024 benchmark.

Conclusion: MLLM-derived reasoning synergizes well with lightweight fusion networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes LLM4-IC8K, a framework using LLMs for automated IC footprint geometry labeling from mechanical drawings, addressing current LMMs' inaccuracies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated parsing of IC footprint geometry is challenging due to unstructured drawings and lack of existing methods.

Method: A two-stage framework trains LMMs on synthetic data for geometric reasoning and fine-tunes on real-world data. It addresses pin count, center coordinates, and pin dimensions.

Result: LLM4-IC8K outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs, validated on the ICGeo8K dataset with 8,608 labeled samples.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively automates IC footprint geometry labeling, improving accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for denoising thermal infrared (TIR) images using latent-space and wavelet-domain optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIR images are useful for robotic perception in poor visibility but suffer from fixed-pattern noise, hindering tasks like object detection and mapping.

Method: Leverages a pretrained stable diffusion model fine-tuned with a novel loss combining latent-space and wavelet-domain (DWT/DTCWT) losses, plus a cascaded refinement stage.

Result: Superior performance on benchmarks and robust zero-shot generalization to real-world TIR datasets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively denoises TIR images, making it practical for robotic applications.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MM-Misogyny, a multimodal approach to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic content in memes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of detecting and understanding misogyny in memes due to their multimodal and nuanced nature.

Method: MM-Misogyny processes text and image separately, unifies them via cross-attention, and uses a classifier and LLM for labeling, categorization, and explanation.

Result: The model excels in detecting and classifying misogyny, providing granular insights into its manifestations in various life domains.

Conclusion: MM-Misogyny is superior to existing methods and offers a comprehensive tool for analyzing misogynistic memes.

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for
entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated
through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme
is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and
text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We
introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely},
\textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic
content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image
modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a
cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily
processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and
Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed
on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath
\textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting
misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories,
\textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only
detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of
how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the
superiority of our approach compared to existing methods. The code and dataset

*Gopalji Gaur,Mohammadreza Zolfaghari,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free method for consistent-subject-generation in text-to-image diffusion models, using masked cross-image attention and regional feature harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of maintaining subject consistency in visual storytelling without computationally expensive fine-tuning or retraining.

Method: Uses masked cross-image attention sharing and regional feature harmonization to align subject features dynamically.

Result: Successfully generates visually consistent subjects across scenarios while preserving model creativity.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently maintains subject consistency in diffusion models without additional training.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

*Rafayel Mkrtchyan,Armen Manukyan,Hrant Khachatrian,Theofanis P. Raptis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning approach using DINOv2 and RF data improves building mapping accuracy, outperforming baselines with a 65.3% IoU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional smart city mapping techniques (cost, accessibility, accuracy) and biases in open-source maps.

Method: Integrates DINOv2 with RF data using a vision transformer to process both modalities, capturing spatial dependencies.

Result: Achieves 65.3% IoU, surpassing baselines (40.1% for erroneous maps, 37.3% for RF-only, 42.2% for non-AI fusion).

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances mapping accuracy by combining RF and map data, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

*Jianqiao Chen,Tingting Zhu,Huishi Song,Nan Ma,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VQ-DeepISC, a digital semantic communication system, uses VQ and DJSCC for efficient semantic feature transmission, achieving high fidelity with adaptive channel optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of digitizing semantic features while preserving continuity and context, enabling interoperability between semantic and digital systems.

Method: Proposes VQ-DeepISC with Swin Transformer for feature extraction, VQ modules for discrete latent spaces, and attention-driven channel adaptation. Includes KLD regularization and EMA for stable training.

Result: Superior reconstruction fidelity compared to benchmarks, validated through experiments.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC effectively bridges semantic and digital communication, offering practical benefits for robust and efficient transmission.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

TL;DR: A deep learning model for weakly supervised object detection in geospatial AI, incorporating spatial principles and attention maps, applied to detect craters on Mars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like lack of training data and neglect of spatial principles in GeoAI to improve integration of AI with geospatial research.

Method: Developed a spatially explicit model using weak labels, incorporated attention maps, and a multistage training strategy.

Result: Successfully detected impact craters on Mars and generalized to other natural/human-made features on Earth and planets.

Conclusion: Advances GeoAI's theoretical and methodological foundations by addressing key challenges and demonstrating practical applications.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores using CCTV footage and computer vision to estimate urban rail platform occupancy, comparing three methods and introducing a novel linear-optimization approach for accurate real-time crowd estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving safety, efficiency, and customer experience by accurately estimating platform occupancy, which is currently challenging with indirect proxies like fare data or staff observations.

Method: Three computer vision approaches: object detection/counting (YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, APGCC), crowd-level classification (Crowd-ViT), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3), plus a novel linear-optimization method for count extraction.

Result: Tested on a WMATA dataset (600+ hours of video), computer vision methods proved valuable for real-time crowd estimation, enabling precise occupancy tracking without relying on other data sources.

Conclusion: CCTV-based computer vision can enhance real-time crowding estimation and support timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient and accurate weed segmentation in precision agriculture drives the development of a quality-aware system to handle image degradation.

Method: The framework analyzes image quality (blur/noise) using Mean Absolute Deviation and Laplacian, then routes data to specialized transformer models (baseline, noise-reducing, or blur-correcting).

Result: The system outperforms CNN-based methods in segmentation quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances deep-learning applications in agriculture by dynamically addressing image degradation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

TL;DR: A pipeline for generating synthetic invoice documents and structured data to overcome dataset limitations in automated invoice processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of acquiring large-scale, diverse datasets due to privacy and annotation costs.

Method: Uses OCR for text/layout extraction, LLM for synthetic content, and inpainting to replace text while preserving layout.

Result: Produces realistic synthetic invoice images and aligned structured data (JSON).

Conclusion: Enables scalable, automated dataset expansion for training robust document intelligence models.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate
document intelligence models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Refine-IQA introduces a multi-stage RFT framework for IQA, enhancing visual perception and supervising the 'think' process, achieving top performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RFT-based IQA methods lack supervision for the 'think' process and direct enhancement of low-level visual perception, limiting performance.

Method: Proposes Refine-IQA with Stage-1 (dataset and multi-task rewards for perception) and Stage-2 (probability difference reward for 'think' supervision).

Result: Refine-IQA models excel in perception, scoring, and quality interpreting tasks.

Conclusion: The framework addresses gaps in RFT for IQA, achieving robust performance and activating advanced 'think' capabilities.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput 4D-STEM data acquisition is hindered by pervasive noise, beam drift, and distortions, which bias measurements. Conventional methods lack generalizability.

Method: 4D-PreNet combines attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures, trained on simulated datasets with varied noise, drift, and distortions.

Result: The pipeline reduces mean squared error by 50% in denoising, achieves sub-pixel center localization (errors <0.04 pixels), and outperforms traditional algorithms.

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet enables reliable, high-throughput 4D-STEM real-time analysis, overcoming limitations of conventional methods.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

Result: HPSv3 proves robust for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP enhances image quality without extra data.

Conclusion: HPSv3 and CoHP provide efficient, human-aligned solutions for evaluating and improving text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human
perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data
coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To
address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.

uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and

Motivation: Impact craters are key for planetary science, and deep learning advancements enable efficient automated detection.

Method: A two-stage framework: first, crater identification using CNNs, ResNet-50, and YOLO; second, YOLO-based localization.

Result: YOLO performs best overall, while ResNet-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

Conclusion: Deep learning models, especially YOLO and ResNet-50, are effective for automated crater detection and identification.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion model is proposed to generate point-based shapes with correspondences, addressing a gap in deep learning methods that ignore point correspondences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep generative models for point clouds lack the ability to generate shapes with point correspondences, which are crucial for tasks like morphological analysis.

Method: The paper introduces a diffusion model trained on shape representation data with correspondences from OASIS-3, focusing on generating realistic point-based hippocampal shapes.

Result: The model successfully generates realistic hippocampal shapes with preserved correspondences and demonstrates utility in downstream tasks like conditional generation and disease progression prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion model effectively bridges the gap in generating shapes with correspondences, offering applications in medical imaging and analysis.

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A recommendation system for prostate cancer segmentation suggests optimal imaging modalities and regions, improving accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists use varied strategies for medical image analysis; the paper aims to enhance segmentation by mimicking these strategies dynamically.

Method: A policy network recommends modalities and regions for a pre-trained segmentation network, iterating until optimal localization is achieved.

Result: The method improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, outperforming standard networks and developing unique strategies.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for interactive assistance to radiologists and challenges existing guidelines like PI-RADS.

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: A two-stage training method reduces reliance on high-quality manual video curation for audio-synchronized visual animation by leveraging noisy pretraining and small-scale fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require expensive manual curation of class-specific training videos, limiting scalability to diverse audio-video classes.

Method: A two-stage paradigm: pretraining on noisy videos for diverse alignments, then fine-tuning on high-quality examples. Multi-feature conditioning and window attention enhance synchronization.

Result: The method reduces manual effort by 10x and generalizes to open classes, validated on the AVSync48 benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach efficiently scales audio-synchronized animation while minimizing human curation, leveraging pretrained models and novel training techniques.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

### [91] [Investigating the Impact of Large-Scale Pre-training on Nutritional Content Estimation from 2D Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03996)
*Michele Andrade,Guilherme A. L. Silva,Valéria Santos,Gladston Moreira,Eduardo Luz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on deep learning models for estimating nutritional content from 2D food images, finding proprietary datasets like JFT-300M outperform public ones like ImageNet and COYO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nutritional estimation from images is challenging due to variability in food presentation and lack of depth information. Reproducibility is limited by reliance on proprietary datasets for pre-training.

Method: Fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on ImageNet and COYO, compared with baseline CNNs and a state-of-the-art method using JFT-300M. Evaluated on Nutrition5k dataset with MAE and MAE%.

Result: JFT-300M pre-trained models significantly outperformed public dataset models. COYO pre-trained model performed worse than ImageNet, contrary to initial expectations.

Conclusion: Pre-training dataset characteristics (scale, domain relevance, curation quality) are crucial for effective transfer learning in nutritional estimation.

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

### [92] [JanusNet: Hierarchical Slice-Block Shuffle and Displacement for Semi-Supervised 3D Multi-Organ Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03997)
*Zheng Zhang,Tianzhuzi Tan,Guanchun Yin,Bo Zhang,Xiuzhuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusNet is a data augmentation framework for 3D medical image segmentation that preserves anatomical continuity while focusing on hard-to-segment regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weakly supervised medical image segmentation suffers from limited training samples and disrupted anatomical continuity in existing augmentation methods.

Method: JanusNet uses Slice-Block Shuffle to preserve anatomical context and Confidence-Guided Displacement to enhance difficult regions.

Result: Achieves a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Conclusion: JanusNet effectively improves segmentation by leveraging anatomical continuity and targeting challenging regions.

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAD-Judge is a verifiable reward system for efficient CAD preference grading and validation, improving Text-to-CAD workflows with fast, direct rewards and robust testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address slow CAD rendering and costly VLM deployments in Text-to-CAD systems, which can degrade performance.

Method: Uses Compiler-as-a-Judge Module (CJM) for fast rewards and Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM) for verification, alongside an agentic CAD generation approach.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAD datasets while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: CAD-Judge effectively optimizes Text-to-CAD workflows with verifiable rewards and robust validation.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

### [94] [$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT: Accurate Quantized Video Diffusion Transformer with Salient Data and Sparse Token Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04016)
*Weilun Feng,Haotong Qin,Chuanguang Yang,Xiangqi Li,Han Yang,Yuqi Li,Zhulin An,Libo Huang,Michele Magno,Yongjun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces S²Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for video diffusion models (V-DMs) to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance. It uses Hessian-aware salient data selection and attention-guided sparse token distillation to address calibration and learning challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models (V-DMs) face high computational costs due to large parameter sizes and long token sequences, leading to calibration variance and learning difficulties. Quantization is a potential solution, but existing methods struggle with these unique challenges.

Method: The proposed S²Q-VDiT framework employs Hessian-aware salient data selection for high-quality calibration datasets and attention-guided sparse token distillation to focus on influential tokens, optimizing quantization for V-DMs.

Result: Under W4A6 quantization, S²Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while compressing the model by 3.9× and accelerating inference by 1.3×.

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT effectively addresses the challenges of quantizing V-DMs, offering significant computational savings without performance loss, making it a practical solution for video generation models.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

*Haiqi Yang,Jinzhe Li,Gengxu Li,Yi Chang,Yuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ISEval, a framework to evaluate LMMs' ability to detect flawed inputs, revealing their limitations and biases in handling errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs, a capability not yet addressed in research.

Method: The ISEval framework evaluates LMMs using seven categories of flawed premises and three metrics, testing ten advanced models.

Result: Most LMMs struggle with detecting flawed inputs without guidance, perform variably by error type, and show modality trust biases.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need to improve LMMs' proactive input verification and offers insights for mitigating these issues.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust
varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info,
while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore
the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and
shed novel insights into mitigating the problem. The code is available at

### [96] [Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network for Remote Sensing Images Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04022)
*Junyi Wang,Jinjiang Li,Guodong Fan,Yakun Ju,Xiang Fang,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PDSSNet improves semantic segmentation in remote sensing by addressing intra-class variance and inter-class similarity through adaptive prototypes and semantic-structure coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to unify class representations and distinguish similar features, leading to incomplete segmentation. Class-guided approaches also lack refined prototypes and structural focus.

Method: PDSSNet uses three modules: APEM for unbiased class prototypes, SSCM for hierarchical semantic-structure coordination, and CSAM for dynamic feature adjustment.

Result: PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The network effectively combines invariant class semantics and variant spatial structure for precise segmentation, with code publicly available.

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCAR is a dual-prompt learning framework for Image-Text Retrieval (ITR), addressing fine-grained attribute and subcategory discrimination challenges. It dynamically adjusts prompts and jointly optimizes attribute and class features, achieving state-of-the-art results on the FDRD benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in applying prompt learning to ITR lies in discriminating fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories in downstream data.

Method: DCAR dynamically adjusts prompt vectors from semantic and visual dimensions, jointly optimizing attribute and class features. It updates attribute weights based on text-image correlation and introduces negative samples for subcategory distinctions.

Result: DCAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FDRD benchmark, covering 1,500 fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs.

Conclusion: DCAR effectively enhances fine-grained representation learning in ITR, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework combining monocular camera and 2D radar to detect pedestrians in NLoS urban environments, improving road safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of NLoS blind spots caused by parked vehicles, which hinder pedestrian detection and road safety.

Method: Integrates monocular camera image segmentation with 2D radar PCD to detect parked vehicles and infer pedestrian locations.

Result: Enhances early pedestrian detection in real-world urban road environments.

Conclusion: The framework improves NLoS pedestrian localization and road safety by dynamically adapting to real-time conditions.

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Motivation: To improve Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in ReID tasks by bridging domain gaps and enhancing feature representations.

Method: Uses CycleGAN for synthetic data generation and an ensemble fusion mechanism (ECAB and SECAB) for feature enhancement and pseudo-label refinement.

Result: Achieves top performance in mAP and Rank-k Accuracy on UDA ReID datasets, supporting lightweight backbones like ResNet18/34.

Conclusion: CORE-ReID V2 advances UDA-based Object ReID, providing a scalable and efficient framework for future research.

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPJFNet is a novel dark image restoration method that improves efficiency by eliminating external priors, optimizing frequency processing, and reducing computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods face efficiency bottlenecks due to reliance on external priors, redundant operations, and indiscriminate frequency processing.

Method: SPJFNet uses a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) for lightweight endogenous guidance, lossless wavelet decomposition, and joint Fourier-based enhancement to streamline operations.

Result: SPJFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing model complexity and computational demands.

Conclusion: The proposed SPJFNet offers an efficient and high-performance solution for dark image restoration, validated by benchmarks.

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: VisualTrans is a new benchmark for Visual Transformation Reasoning (VTR) in real-world human-object interactions, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks. It evaluates spatial, procedural, and quantitative reasoning across 12 tasks with 472 QA pairs. State-of-the-art models perform well in static tasks but struggle with dynamic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTR benchmarks have a sim-to-real gap, limited complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage, hindering practical use in real-world scenarios.

Method: VisualTrans includes 12 diverse tasks, 6 subtask types, and 472 QA pairs. A scalable pipeline uses first-person videos, automated annotation, and human verification for high-quality data.

Result: Models excel in static spatial tasks but fail in dynamic, multi-step reasoning, revealing weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning.

Conclusion: VisualTrans highlights gaps in current VTR capabilities and provides a foundation for future research to improve dynamic reasoning in AI systems.

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces IPA-CP, a semi-supervised learning method for tumor segmentation in CT scans, addressing challenges like small tumors and underutilized data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods focus on large organs, neglecting small or numerous tumors, and lack thorough investigation of data augmentation for labeled/unlabeled data.

Method: IPA-CP uses a two-way uncertainty-based adaptive augmentation and iterative pseudo-labeling to enhance tumor segmentation.

Result: IPA-CP outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation, validated by in-house and public datasets.

Conclusion: IPA-CP is effective for tumor segmentation, with its adaptive augmentation and pseudo-labeling strategies proving superior to existing methods.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

*Jiayi He,Xu Wang,Shengeng Tang,Yaxiong Wang,Lechao Cheng,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-phase framework for sign language video generation decouples motion semantics from signer identity, enabling high-quality synthesis with minimal data and flexible personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenges of excessive data requirements and poor generalization in sign language video generation by separating motion from identity.

Method: A two-phase synthesis: (1) creating a signer-independent motion lexicon, and (2) transforming gloss sequences into coherent motion trajectories with identity-aware rendering.

Result: The method achieves high-quality synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Conclusion: Disentangling motion from identity is viable and advantageous for sign language video generation.

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

### [104] [DOMR: Establishing Cross-View Segmentation via Dense Object Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04050)
*Jitong Liao,Yulu Gao,Shaofei Huang,Jialin Gao,Jie Lei,Ronghua Liang,Si Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the DOMR framework for dense object matching between egocentric and exocentric views, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view object correspondence is critical for visual understanding but challenging due to differences in perspectives.

Method: The DOMR framework includes a Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module that models multiple objects jointly using visual, spatial, and semantic cues, and a mask refinement head for improved accuracy.

Result: DOMR achieves mean IoU scores of 49.7% (Ego→Exo) and 55.2% (Exo→Ego), outperforming previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively.

Conclusion: The integrated approach of DOMR is effective for cross-view understanding, as validated by benchmark results.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

### [105] [Towards Globally Predictable k-Space Interpolation: A White-box Transformer Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04051)
*Chen Luo,Qiyu Jin,Taofeng Xie,Xuemei Wang,Huayu Wang,Congcong Liu,Liming Tang,Guoqing Chen,Zhuo-Xu Cui,Dong Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework for k-space interpolation in MRI, combining global predictability with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for k-space interpolation focus on local predictability but ignore global dependencies. Transformers, known for capturing long-range dependencies, lack interpretability, raising reliability concerns.

Method: The authors introduce GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer based on Globally Predictable Interpolation (GPI). GPI is formulated as a structured low-rank (SLR) model with learnable global annihilation filters, inducing a learnable attention mechanism. The SLR optimization is unfolded into a cascaded network.

Result: GPI-WT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in k-space interpolation accuracy and offers superior interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed GPI-WT framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by leveraging global dependencies and ensuring interpretability, making it a promising tool for accelerated MRI.

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

*Fangmin Zhao,Weichao Zeng,Zhenhang Li,Dongbao Yang,Binbin Li,Xiaojun Bi,Yu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-DocDiff is a unified, scalable document restoration model using diffusion, with learnable task prompts and a Prior Pool mechanism to enhance multi-task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the limitations of independent task-specific models and the lack of scalability in unified approaches for document restoration.

Method: Proposes Uni-DocDiff with learnable task prompts, a Prior Pool for feature combination, and a Prior Fusion Module for adaptive task-specific prior selection.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific models while maintaining scalability for new tasks.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff offers a scalable, unified solution for document restoration, outperforming specialized models and adapting seamlessly to new tasks.

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

### [107] [TCSAFormer: Efficient Vision Transformer with Token Compression and Sparse Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04058)
*Zunhui Xia,Hongxing Li,Libin Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCSAFormer is a transformer-based medical image segmentation network that addresses computational complexity and local feature capture limitations through Compressed Attention and Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network modules, achieving SOTA performance with lower overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based methods for medical image segmentation face high computational complexity and limited local feature capture, hindering precise segmentation.

Method: TCSAFormer introduces Compressed Attention (CA) for efficient token processing and Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) for local and multiscale feature capture.

Result: TCSAFormer outperforms SOTA methods on ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse datasets, balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: TCSAFormer effectively addresses transformer limitations, offering a high-performance, efficient solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

*Zhaochen Liu,Kaiwen Gao,Shuyi Liang,Bin Xiao,Limeng Qiao,Lin Ma,Tingting Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O-Bench is introduced as the first VQA benchmark for occlusion perception, revealing a performance gap between MLLMs and humans, with identified failure patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate the under-explored occlusion perception capabilities of MLLMs compared to humans.

Method: Constructed 1,365 images with occlusion scenarios using layered synthesis, annotated 4,588 QA pairs across five tasks, and evaluated 22 MLLMs.

Result: Significant performance gap between MLLMs and humans, not bridged by scaling or reasoning. Identified three failure patterns.

Conclusion: O-Bench serves as a vital tool for evaluating and improving MLLMs' occlusion perception, inspiring better visual intelligence.

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

*Chengqian Dai,Yonghong Guo,Hongzhao Xiang,Yigui Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TNet is a Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network that uses convolution and addition to integrate global and local features across decoding stages, outperforming existing methods on remote sensing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation networks focus on intra-scale relationships but neglect global contextual dependencies across resolutions.

Method: TNet leverages convolution and addition to progressively fuse low-resolution (global) and high-resolution (local) features in decoder stages.

Result: TNet-R achieves mIoU of 85.35% (Vaihingen), 87.05% (Potsdam), and 52.19% (LoveDA) with high efficiency.

Conclusion: TNet effectively blends global and local information, offering competitive performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,
often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DSR is a 3D Gaussian-splatting-based super-resolution framework using 2D diffusion models, ensuring 3D consistency without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve high-resolution 3D scene reconstruction with explicit 3D consistency, unlike prior methods that lack or implicitly handle it.

Method: Leverages 2D diffusion models for super-resolution within a 3D Gaussian-splatting framework, ensuring spatial coherence.

Result: Produces visually compelling high-resolution results on MipNeRF360 and LLFF datasets while maintaining 3D structural consistency.

Conclusion: 3DSR effectively enhances visual quality and 3D consistency without additional fine-tuning, outperforming prior approaches.

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

*Zexu Huang,Min Xu,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DET-GS improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by introducing depth and edge-aware regularization, enhancing geometric accuracy and visual fidelity under sparse-view conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming challenges in accurate geometric reconstruction and preserving fine structures under sparse-view conditions, where existing methods fail due to noise sensitivity and poor boundary handling.

Method: Proposes DET-GS, a framework with hierarchical geometric depth supervision, edge-aware regularization using Canny edge detection, and RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity on sparse-view benchmarks.

Conclusion: DET-GS effectively addresses limitations of current methods, offering robust and high-quality novel view synthesis.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

TL;DR: NEARL-CLIP bridges the domain gap in medical image analysis by introducing a cross-modality interaction framework with USEformer and OCA, enhancing VLM performance with minimal parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited annotated medical datasets and the domain gap hinder the application of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP in medical imaging. Existing methods often misalign modalities.

Method: Proposes NEARL-CLIP with USEformer for dynamic cross-modality queries and OCA for orthogonally decoupling new knowledge, enabling efficient modality interaction.

Result: Achieves improved performance with only 1.46M additional parameters, fostering better multi-modal medical knowledge integration.

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP effectively bridges the domain gap and enhances VLM capabilities for medical image analysis through efficient cross-modality interaction.

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human perception studies are valuable but complex and hard to scale; AR provides a unique opportunity to streamline this process.

Method: ARCADE leverages AR for CV evaluation, supporting cross-platform data collection, pluggable model inference, and AR streaming.

Result: ARCADE effectively elicits human judgments for CV model quality (e.g., depth and lighting estimation) and demonstrates usability and flexibility.

Conclusion: ARCADE is a flexible and effective human-centered evaluation platform for CV research.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMSeg is a lightweight framework for Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) that leverages MLLM's visual encoder without extra parameters, outperforming SAM-based and SAM-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between performance and cost in RES by avoiding heavy models like SAM while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Proposes MLLMSeg, utilizing MLLM's visual encoder, a DSFF module for feature fusion, and a lightweight mask decoder (34M parameters).

Result: Outperforms SAM-based and SAM-free methods, balancing performance and cost effectively.

Conclusion: MLLMSeg offers a cost-efficient, high-performance solution for RES by integrating MLLM features without additional encoders.

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for vehicle search are resource-intensive and impractical due to separate detection and Re-ID steps. The paper aims to unify these tasks efficiently.

Method: Proposes CLIPVehicle with dual-granularity semantic-region alignment and multi-level learning (global, instance, feature). Introduces new benchmarks: CityFlowVS, SynVS-Day, SynVS-All.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle effectively unifies detection and Re-ID, demonstrating superior performance on new benchmarks.

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

TL;DR: OC-DiT is a diffusion model for object-centric prediction, achieving zero-shot instance segmentation by conditioning on object templates and image features. It introduces coarse and refinement models, trained on synthetic data, and excels on real-world benchmarks without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of zero-shot instance segmentation by leveraging diffusion models to disentangle object instances using visual descriptors and localized cues.

Method: A conditional latent diffusion framework with two variants: a coarse model for initial proposals and a refinement model for parallel refinement. Trained on a synthetic dataset of high-quality object meshes.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on real-world benchmarks without target data retraining.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of diffusion models for instance segmentation, offering a novel approach to object-centric prediction.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper challenges the necessity of multi-scale feature fusion in underwater image enhancement, proposing a single-scale approach (SSD-Net) that matches or outperforms multi-scale methods while reducing complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UIE methods rely on multi-scale feature extraction, but experiments show single-scale methods can achieve comparable or better results with lower complexity.

Method: Introduces SSD-Net, a single-scale decomposition network with asymmetrical decomposition, combining CNN and Transformer strengths via PFDB and BFCB modules.

Result: SSD-Net effectively decouples degradation from clean layers, enhancing image quality without multi-scale fusion.

Conclusion: Single-scale feature extraction is viable for UIE, offering a simpler yet effective alternative to multi-scale methods.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Conclusion: The method offers a practical, efficient solution for litter detection in real-world applications.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools

study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge to address cross-domain generalization in deception detection, leveraging multimodal data for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deception detection methods struggle with domain shifts, limiting their real-world applicability.

Method: A benchmark challenge requiring models to generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets using audio, video, and text data.

Result: 21 teams participated, submitting models for evaluation.

Conclusion: The challenge aims to advance adaptable, explainable, and deployable deception detection systems through multimodal learning.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

*Zhaohong Huang,Yuxin Zhang,Mingbao Lin,Taojian Zhou,Guorong Cai,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DS²Net introduces multi-view deep supervision for medical image segmentation, combining detail and semantic feature supervision with an adaptive loss, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods supervise either coarse-grained or fine-grained features in isolation, ignoring their vital relationships in medical image analysis.

Method: Proposes DS²Net with Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM) for multi-view supervision, and an uncertainty-based adaptive loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six benchmarks across colonoscopy, ultrasound, and microscope datasets.

Conclusion: DS²Net effectively combines detail and semantic supervision, offering a robust solution for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

### [121] [UniFGVC: Universal Training-Free Few-Shot Fine-Grained Vision Classification via Attribute-Aware Multimodal Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04136)
*Hongyu Guo,Kuan Zhu,Xiangzhao Hao,Haiyun Guo,Ming Tang,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFGVC is a training-free framework for few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) that reformulates the task as multimodal retrieval, leveraging structured text descriptions and multimodal templates for improved generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from overfitting and weak generalization when finetuning pre-trained models for few-shot FGVC. UniFGVC addresses this by avoiding training and instead using multimodal retrieval.

Method: UniFGVC uses a Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to generate structured text descriptions from images, constructs multimodal templates, and performs retrieval in a joint vision-text space.

Result: UniFGVC outperforms prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and some fully-supervised approaches on 12 FGVC benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniFGVC provides a robust, training-free solution for few-shot FGVC with broad compatibility and superior performance.

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

### [122] [IDCNet: Guided Video Diffusion for Metric-Consistent RGBD Scene Generation with Precise Camera Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04147)
*Lijuan Liu,Wenfa Li,Dongbo Zhang,Shuo Wang,Shaohui Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IDC-Net is a unified framework for generating RGB-D video sequences with precise camera control, combining RGB and depth synthesis in a geometry-aware diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat RGB and depth generation separately, lacking spatial and geometric alignment. IDC-Net aims to improve this by joint learning.

Method: IDC-Net uses a unified geometry-aware diffusion model, a camera-image-depth consistent dataset, and a geometry-aware transformer block for fine-grained control.

Result: IDC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality and geometric consistency, enabling direct use in 3D scene reconstruction.

Conclusion: The joint learning framework of IDC-Net enhances geometric fidelity and camera control, offering practical benefits for downstream tasks.

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

*Yihua Shao,Xiaofeng Lin,Xinwei Long,Siyu Chen,Minxi Yan,Yang Liu,Ziyang Yan,Ao Ma,Hao Tang,Jingcai Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICM-Fusion integrates meta-learning and in-context adaptation to improve multi-task generalization in LoRA models, reducing conflicts and forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA fusion methods cause inter-weight conflicts and domain forgetting, especially in few-shot or long-tailed scenarios.

Method: Proposes ICM-Fusion with task vector arithmetic and Fusion VAE to dynamically balance and reconstruct fused LoRA.

Result: ICM-Fusion reduces multi-tasking loss and enhances performance in few-shot scenarios across visual and linguistic tasks.

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion is adaptable and effective for multi-task LoRA fusion, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

### [124] [Audio-Assisted Face Video Restoration with Temporal and Identity Complementary Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04161)
*Yuqin Cao,Yixuan Gao,Wei Sun,Xiaohong Liu,Yulun Zhang,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAVN is a network for restoring degraded face videos using audio and visual correlations, outperforming existing methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face video restoration methods ignore audio-visual correlations, especially in mouth regions, and focus narrowly on compression artifacts.

Method: GAVN uses identity and temporal complementary learning: capturing temporal features in low-resolution, then refining with audio and face landmarks in high-resolution, and integrating both for reconstruction.

Result: GAVN surpasses state-of-the-art methods in compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.

Conclusion: GAVN effectively leverages audio-visual correlations for superior face video restoration across multiple degradation types.

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

*Subhankar Swain,Naquee Rizwan,Nayandeep Deb,Vishwajeet Singh Solanki,Vishwa Gangadhar S,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a dataset of 6,300 real-world memes annotated for toxicity and proposes a tag generation module to enhance meme moderation systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of accessible data for meme moderation, given the role of memes in spreading harmful content online.

Method: A two-stage annotation process (binary and fine-grained) and a tag generation module to enrich meme context.

Result: Incorporating socially grounded tags improves detection performance in state-of-the-art VLMs.

Conclusion: The dataset and tag module provide a scalable foundation for better content moderation in multimodal online spaces.

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

### [126] [AD-FM: Multimodal LLMs for Anomaly Detection via Multi-Stage Reasoning and Fine-Grained Reward Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04175)
*Jingyi Liao,Yongyi Su,Rong-Cheng Tu,Zhao Jin,Wenhao Sun,Yiting Li,Dacheng Tao,Xun Xu,Xulei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses limitations in applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to anomaly detection by introducing a multi-stage reasoning process and fine-grained reward mechanism, improving accuracy and adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for anomaly detection using MLLMs face challenges like inadequate data utilization and lack of supervision over reasoning processes, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process and a fine-grained reward mechanism to enhance training and supervision.

Result: Demonstrates significant performance improvements in adapting MLLMs to specialized anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap between general MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained requirements of anomaly detection.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

*Jin Kuang,Dong Liu,Yukuang Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U2CLLIE is a novel framework for low-light image enhancement, addressing uncertainty and noise in dark conditions through uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color causal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook intrinsic uncertainty in feature representations under dark conditions, leading to degraded gradients and noise dominance, impairing reliability and causal reasoning.

Method: U2CLLIE integrates an Uncertainty-Aware Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module for noise suppression and a hierarchical causality-aware framework with Luminance Enhancement Network (LEN) and causal correlation modules (NeCo and AsC).

Result: U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, showing robustness and generalization across scenes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates gradient vanishing and noise dominance, enhancing low-light images with improved reliability and causal reasoning.

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

TL;DR: The paper explores the practical utility and training stability of large-scale vision models like ViT-22B, comparing its performance to ViT and investigating its potential for image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the practical utility and training behavior of large-scale vision models like ViT-22B in local environments, addressing training instability and exploring new applications like image generation.

Method: Examined ViT-22B's training dynamics in local settings, modified the model to stabilize training, and proposed an image generation architecture using ViT and ViT-22B.

Result: ViT-22B outperformed ViT in performance under the same parameter size and showed potential for image generation, though stability issues were noted.

Conclusion: ViT-22B is promising for vision tasks and image generation, but requires modifications for stable training.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

*Fengyi Wu,Yimian Dai,Tianfang Zhang,Yixuan Ding,Jian Yang,Ming-Ming Cheng,Zhenming Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPCANet++ is a deep learning framework combining RPCA's interpretability with efficiency, addressing computational and adaptability issues in traditional RPCA for sparse object segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RPCA models are computationally heavy, rely on hyperparameters, and lack adaptability in dynamic scenarios.

Method: RPCANet++ unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a network with Background Approximation, Object Extraction, and Image Restoration Modules, enhanced by a Memory-Augmented Module and Deep Contrast Prior Module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in sparse object segmentation across diverse datasets, with improved interpretability.

Conclusion: RPCANet++ sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation by merging RPCA's strengths with deep learning efficiency.

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

*Dunyuan Xu,Xikai Yang,Yaoqian Li,Jinpeng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MLLMU-Med, the first benchmark for evaluating unlearning in biomedical MLLMs, addressing privacy leaks and incorrect knowledge removal. It highlights the inefficiency of current unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical MLLMs risk privacy leaks and incorrect outputs due to undetected private or erroneous training data. Retraining is impractical, necessitating unlearning solutions.

Method: Proposes MLLMU-Med, a benchmark with synthetic private data and factual errors, and an Unlearning Efficiency Score to evaluate unlearning methods.

Result: Current unlearning methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful knowledge from biomedical MLLMs.

Conclusion: MLLMU-Med provides a foundation for improving unlearning techniques in biomedical MLLMs, revealing significant gaps in current approaches.

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GAT, a novel model for Video TextVQA, focusing on instance-oriented text reading and reasoning, improving accuracy and efficiency over frame-level methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frame-level methods for Video TextVQA suffer from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, limiting accuracy and efficiency.

Method: GAT uses a context-aggregated instance gathering module for unified textual representation and an instance-focused trajectory tracing module for spatio-temporal relationships.

Result: GAT outperforms existing methods by 3.86% in accuracy and is ten times faster than video large language models.

Conclusion: GAT effectively addresses the limitations of frame-level methods, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency in Video TextVQA.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

TL;DR: BootSC is a deep spectral clustering model that integrates all stages of spectral clustering into a single end-to-end network, improving performance and representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the disjoint optimization and limited representation capacity of traditional spectral clustering methods.

Method: Jointly learns affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and k-means clustering using a single network, with optimal-transport-derived supervision and orthogonal re-parameterization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, e.g., 16% NMI improvement on ImageNet-Dogs.

Conclusion: BootSC effectively enhances spectral clustering by unifying and optimizing all stages, demonstrating superior results.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

TL;DR: ViFP is a framework to improve visual-language model reasoning by detecting false positives (FPs) and enhancing reasoning reliability through sub-question templates, multi-turn QA, and adaptive CoT mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for FP reasoning in VLMs are dataset-dependent, costly, and lack generalization. ViFP aims to address these limitations.

Method: ViFP constructs sub-question templates, uses multi-turn QA for reasoning paths, dynamically analyzes path consistency, and employs adaptive CoT to guide reasoning.

Result: ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4% on A-OKVQA, reduces FPs, and outperforms previous methods.

Conclusion: ViFP enhances reasoning reliability in VLMs by addressing FP issues and introducing a new metric (VoC) for evaluation.

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MMCAF-Net, a multimodal deep learning model for medical diagnosis, addressing dimensionality challenges in data fusion and improving diagnostic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in diagnosing small lesions and dimensionality differences in medical imaging and EHR data hinder effective multimodal fusion.

Method: MMCAF-Net uses a feature pyramid and 3D multi-scale convolutional attention for lesion-specific features, plus a cross-attention module for multimodal fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, showing higher diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net effectively addresses multimodal fusion challenges and improves medical disease diagnosis.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

*Josip Šarić,Ivan Martinović,Matej Kristan,Siniša Šegvić*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies bottlenecks in open-vocabulary segmentation models and proposes oracle components to address them, offering insights for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-vocabulary models fail to recognize concepts outside training taxonomies, and performance has plateaued for years.

Method: Proposes novel oracle components leveraging groundtruth information to identify and decouple bottlenecks.

Result: Validation experiments reveal key empirical findings about open-vocabulary model failures.

Conclusion: The study suggests approaches to unlock future research in open-vocabulary segmentation.

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

*Jiahui Li,Shengeng Tang,Jingxuan He,Gang Huang,Zhangye Wang,Yantao Pan,Lechao Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplitGaussian decouples static and dynamic scene components to improve 3D reconstruction from monocular video, addressing motion leakage and flickering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods entangle static and dynamic elements, causing artifacts like motion leakage and distortions.

Method: Proposes SplitGaussian, explicitly separating static and dynamic components, with dynamic elements deforming over time.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in rendering quality, stability, and motion separation.

Conclusion: Disentangled representation enhances fidelity, consistency, and convergence speed.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on continual learning for vision-language models (VLM-CL), addressing challenges like catastrophic forgetting, cross-modal drift, and zero-shot capability erosion. It proposes a taxonomy of solutions and highlights the need for better benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unique challenges of continual learning in VLMs, such as cross-modal feature drift and parameter interference, which degrade performance over time.

Method: Identifies three core failure modes in VLM-CL and proposes a taxonomy of solutions: Multi-Modal Replay Strategies, Cross-Modal Regularization, and Parameter-Efficient Adaptation.

Result: Highlights the limitations of current evaluation protocols and datasets, advocating for benchmarks that better capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional generalization.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a diagnostic reference for lifelong vision-language systems, outlining future directions like continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerT2V introduces a layered approach for Text-to-Video (T2V) generation to handle multi-object motion, improving performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2V models struggle with multi-object motion and intersecting trajectories due to semantic conflicts, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: LayerT2V composites videos layer by layer, separating background and foreground objects to enable coherent multi-object synthesis.

Result: LayerT2V outperforms SOTA methods with 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics.

Conclusion: LayerT2V enhances control and performance in T2V generation for complex multi-object scenarios.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

*Yu Liu,Zhijie Liu,Xiao Ren,You-Fu Li,He Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based model for pedestrian trajectory prediction incorporates motion intentions to improve interpretability and precision, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on ETH and UCY benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles, but existing models often overlook motion intentions, limiting interpretability and precision.

Method: The proposed model integrates motion intentions (lateral and longitudinal components) via an intention recognition module and uses an efficient guidance mechanism for interpretable trajectories.

Result: The model achieves competitive performance on ETH and UCY benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating motion intentions into diffusion-based models enhances trajectory prediction, offering improved interpretability and precision.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DocVCE, a novel method using generative counterfactuals to explain document image classification models, addressing interpretability gaps in AI-driven workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving transparency and reliability of black-box AI systems in document processing, especially to mitigate biases and spurious correlations in high-stakes applications.

Method: Proposes DocVCE, leveraging latent diffusion models and classifier guidance to generate visual counterfactual explanations, followed by hierarchical patch-wise refinement.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on three datasets (RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, DocLayNet) and models (ResNet, ConvNeXt, DiT) using validity, closeness, and realism metrics.

Conclusion: First work to explore generative counterfactual explanations in document image analysis, offering actionable insights into model decisions.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying and classifying objects in SAR imagery using CNNs, particularly for geometric and environmental tasks.

Method: Uses a single scattering approximation with CNNs on simulated SAR data and reconstructed images, and applies this to real Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for ice type classification.

Result: Achieves high classification accuracy (≥75%) for both object shapes and ice types, demonstrating CNN effectiveness in SAR tasks.

Conclusion: CNNs are effective for SAR-based classification, with antenna height impacting classification success, highlighting practical considerations for SAR data acquisition.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and
classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to
classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and
reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

*Muhua Zhu,Xinhao Jin,Chengbo Wang,Yongcong Zhang,Yifei Xue,Tie Ji,Yizhen Lao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIS3R is a novel image stitching method using deep 3D reconstruction to handle large parallax, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing stitching methods struggle with large parallax due to depth variations and significant camera baselines.

Method: Uses a transformer for 3D scene reconstruction, reprojects point clouds for alignment, and refines results with a diffusion module.

Result: Accurate stitching for large parallax, preserving geometric integrity and outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: PIS3R is robust for large parallax and suitable for downstream 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from
relying on direct human observation to more nuanced approaches integrating
computational methods in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
While conventional approaches introduce bias and can fail to capture the

benefits, the integration of AI into social behavior research also poses
several challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools

TL;DR: The paper proposes SAV, a framework for vehicle part segmentation, addressing SAM's limitations by integrating a knowledge graph and context retrieval. It also introduces a new dataset, VehicleSeg10K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large segmentation models like SAM lack fine-grained semantic labels and text-prompted functionality, limiting their use in vehicle part segmentation.

Method: SAV combines a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph for spatial relationships, and a context retrieval module for improved segmentation.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on VehicleSeg10K and other datasets benchmark performance, showing SAV's effectiveness.

Conclusion: SAV advances vehicle part segmentation by leveraging structured knowledge and contextual priors, with potential for future research.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT) in Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) suffers from severe forgetting, showing PVMs retain knowledge well. It proposes DFT*, a simple enhancement to DFT, outperforming complex methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reassess the assumption that DFT is prone to catastrophic forgetting in CSS and explore the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs).

Method: Systematically evaluates DFT on Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K benchmarks using ResNet101 and Swin-B backbones. Proposes DFT* by freezing backbones and classifiers, and pre-allocating future classifiers.

Result: PVMs retain knowledge with minimal forgetting under DFT. DFT* outperforms 16 state-of-the-art CSS methods with fewer parameters and less training time.

Conclusion: DFT* is a simple, effective solution for CSS, leveraging PVMs' inherent capabilities and outperforming complex methods.

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PKSS-Align, a robust point cloud registration method handling similarity transformations, noise, and defects without training or complex features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sensitivity to transformations, noise, and defects in point cloud registration, avoiding local optima issues.

Method: Uses Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS) for shape feature-based similarity, eliminating need for point-to-point metrics. Directly generates transformation matrices.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness and efficiency, with practical feasibility.

Conclusion: PKSS-Align is effective for diverse point cloud registration challenges, offering simplicity and performance.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high computational demands of deploying vision-language models by leveraging frozen embeddings.

Method: Uses frozen pretrained embeddings for vision-language tasks, analyzing their effectiveness and computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves 85-95% of state-of-the-art performance with 68.4M parameters, offering 2.3x speedup and 52% lower energy use.

Conclusion: Frozen embeddings are viable when pretraining aligns with task needs, providing efficiency gains without significant performance loss.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for
generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling
mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple
objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also
demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360
datasets.

### [149] [Length Matters: Length-Aware Transformer for Temporal Sentence Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04299)
*Yifan Wang,Ziyi Liu,Xiaolong Sun,Jiawei Wang,Hongmin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LATR, a Length-Aware Transformer for Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG), which improves query specialization by leveraging length priors to avoid redundant predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DETR-based TSG models suffer from overlapping query roles due to lack of explicit supervision, leading to redundant predictions.

Method: LATR divides queries into three groups (short, middle, long durations) and introduces a length classification task to suppress mismatched predictions.

Result: LATR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, with ablation studies confirming the importance of length priors.

Conclusion: Incorporating length priors enhances query specialization, improving TSG performance.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

*Kun Gui,Hongliang Ren,Shang Shi,Jin Lu,Changqiu Yu,Quanjun Cao,Guomin Gu,Qi Xuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MAEPD, a foundational model for DAS signal recognition using a Masked Autoencoder, pretrained on diverse datasets and fine-tuned with Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), achieving high accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like data distribution disparities and limited labeled data in DAS signal recognition, which hinder cross-domain generalization.

Method: Pretrains MAEPD on 635,860 diverse DAS samples using self-supervised mask reconstruction, then fine-tunes with VPT for downstream tasks, freezing most parameters.

Result: Achieves 96.94% accuracy in gait recognition with only 0.322% parameters fine-tuned, outperforming Full Fine Tuning by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%.

Conclusion: MAEPD is a robust, efficient, and scalable foundational model, offering a new paradigm for improving generalization in DAS signal recognition.

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

### [151] [Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination: A Training Bias Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04567)
*Yifan Li,Kun Zhou,Wayne Xin Zhao,Lei Fang,Ji-Rong Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) due to training bias, introduces the POPEv2 benchmark, and proposes Obliviate, an unlearning method to mitigate hallucination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs suffer from hallucination, generating text inconsistent with visual input, prompting a study on training data's role in this issue.

Method: Introduces POPEv2 benchmark with counterfactual images, probes model components, and develops Obliviate, a lightweight unlearning method targeting the LM head.

Result: Obliviate reduces hallucination significantly, updating only 2% of parameters, and scales well with model size and data volume.

Conclusion: Obliviate effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating scalability and generalization, with code and data to be released.

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

*Xiaoxuan He,Siming Fu,Yuke Zhao,Wanli Li,Jian Yang,Dacheng Yin,Fengyun Rao,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TempFlow-GRPO improves text-to-image generation by addressing temporal uniformity in reward assignment, using trajectory branching and noise-aware weighting for better alignment with human preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow matching models for text-to-image generation struggle with fine-grained reward-based optimization due to uniform credit assignment, leading to inefficient exploration.

Method: TempFlow-GRPO introduces trajectory branching for process rewards and noise-aware weighting to modulate policy optimization based on timestep criticality.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

Conclusion: TempFlow-GRPO effectively addresses temporal uniformity, enhancing exploration and convergence in flow-based generation.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

### [153] [RiemanLine: Riemannian Manifold Representation of 3D Lines for Factor Graph Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04335)
*Yanyan Li,Ze Yang,Keisuke Tateno,Federico Tombari Liang Zhao,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces RiemanLine, a minimal 3D line representation on Riemannian manifolds, accommodating both individual lines and parallel-line groups, improving accuracy and reducing parameter dimensionality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing line representations ignore structural regularities like parallel lines common in man-made environments, limiting efficiency and accuracy in tasks like camera localization.

Method: RiemanLine decouples lines into global (vanishing direction on S²) and local (scaled normal vectors) components, reducing parameter space for parallel lines and embedding parallelism naturally. Integrated into a factor graph for manifold-based bundle adjustment.

Result: Experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic benchmarks show improved pose estimation, line reconstruction, convergence stability, and reduced dimensionality.

Conclusion: RiemanLine provides a unified, efficient representation for 3D lines, enhancing accuracy and stability in applications like camera localization and structural mapping.

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

*Songyun Yang,Yufei Han,Jilong Zhang,Kongming Liang,Peng Yu,Zhaowei Qu,Heng Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RotatedMVPS improves shape and reflectance recovery under natural light using a rotation stage and integrates learning-based priors for better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MVPS methods require controlled settings or neglect reflectance and illumination recovery, limiting real-world applicability.

Method: Uses a rotation stage for light consistency and integrates learning-based single-view priors into MVPS.

Result: Effective shape and reflectance recovery demonstrated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS enhances MVPS applicability in natural illumination scenarios and inverse rendering tasks.

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Canhui Tang,Zifan Han,Hongbo Sun,Sanping Zhou,Xuchong Zhang,Xin Wei,Ye Yuan,Jinglin Xu,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSPO uses reinforcement learning to optimize frame sampling in MLLMs for long videos, improving event capture and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with long videos due to sparse frame sampling limitations and lack of event-aware methods.

Method: Proposes TSPO: a trainable event-aware agent and RL paradigm for joint keyframe selection and language generation, with rule-based rewards.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on long video benchmarks and shows transferability across Video-MLLMs.

Conclusion: TSPO effectively addresses long-video challenges in MLLMs, enhancing understanding and performance.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

TL;DR: VisionTS++ bridges gaps in cross-modal transfer from vision to time series forecasting with innovations in data filtering, multivariate conversion, and probabilistic forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address discrepancies in cross-modal transfer from vision to time series: data-modality gap, multivariate-forecasting gap, and probabilistic-forecasting gap.

Method: Proposes VisionTS++ with three innovations: vision-model-based filtering, colorized multivariate conversion, and multi-quantile forecasting.

Result: Achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized models by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9/12 probabilistic forecasting settings.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing universal time series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoN, a few-shot learning framework, uses a graph-based approach with a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) to improve ear biometric recognition by jointly processing multiple impressions and enhancing discriminative power.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ear biometrics face challenges like limited annotated data and intra-class variability, restricting consistent and discriminative feature extraction.

Method: ProtoN employs a graph-based approach with PGNN, using class-specific graphs and a dual-path message-passing mechanism, alongside cross-graph prototype alignment and a hybrid loss function.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99.60% Rank-1 accuracy and 0.025 EER on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: ProtoN effectively addresses few-shot ear recognition challenges, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness under limited data.

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

TL;DR: SI3FP is a scalable pipeline for generating LoD3 thermal models from images, combining computer vision and deep learning to accurately identify features like windows for building renovation planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for scalable and accurate identification of building features (e.g., windows) in thermal 3D models are insufficient for early-phase renovation planning.

Method: SI3FP uses computer vision and deep learning to extract geometries directly from images, modeling geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane to reduce distortions.

Result: Tested on Swedish residential buildings, SI3FP achieved ~5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, suitable for early-stage renovation analysis.

Conclusion: SI3FP enables large-scale energy renovation planning and has broader urban development applications.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Motivation: Existing text-based CoT methods for MLLMs suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains.

Method: Proposes VITAL, an end-to-end agentic framework with a visual toolbox for dense frame sampling and multimodal CoT. Introduces datasets MTVR-CoT-72k and MTVR-RL-110k, and DGRPO algorithm for multi-task RL.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in video QA and temporal grounding, especially for long videos, as shown on 11 benchmarks.

Conclusion: VITAL advances video reasoning by addressing cross-modal limitations and hallucination, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: A novel Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention method is proposed to address the computational inefficiency of Transformers in Multitask Learning, reducing FLOPs and latency while improving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' Multi-Head-Attention becomes computationally infeasible for Multitask Learning due to quadratic scaling with task numbers.

Method: Introduces Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention for efficient cross-task information aggregation.

Result: Achieves order-of-magnitude reductions in FLOPs and latency, with up to 7.4% improvement in task metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively balances computational efficiency and performance in Multitask Learning.

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a new task for object-level precision in multi-modal retrieval, and proposes CORE, a model that outperforms existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods lack object-level precision, limiting their ability to localize specific objects based on composed expressions.

Method: The authors propose CORE, an end-to-end model with reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning.

Result: CORE significantly outperforms existing models, demonstrated through experiments on the COR127K benchmark.

Conclusion: COR and CORE advance fine-grained multi-modal retrieval, setting a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limited labeled data in pathology by leveraging self-supervised foundation models for mitotic figure classification, a key prognostic marker.

Method: Evaluated data scaling laws and robustness of foundation models, comparing LoRA adaptation and linear probing against end-to-end-trained CNNs and Vision Transformers.

Result: LoRA-adapted models perform close to 100% data availability with just 10% data and reduce out-of-domain performance gaps.

Conclusion: LoRA-adapted foundation models are highly effective for mitotic classification, though traditional fine-tuning remains competitive.

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

### [163] [Boosting Visual Knowledge-Intensive Training for LVLMs Through Causality-Driven Visual Object Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04453)
*Qingguo Hu,Ante Wang,Jia Song,Delai Qiu,Qingsong Liu,Jinsong Su*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a self-improvement framework for LVLMs using a visual knowledge-intensive task (CVC) to enhance visual perception and reasoning, achieving notable performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs lack deep visual perception due to limited visual knowledge in training corpora, hindering tasks like identifying subtle image differences.

Method: Proposes CVC, a causality-driven task for inferring masked objects in images, using automated instance construction and trial-and-error learning.

Result: Achieves average improvements of 5.4% and 4.0% on specialized tasks with LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively.

Conclusion: The CVC framework effectively enhances LVLMs' visual perception and reasoning, validated by significant performance gains.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

### [164] [4DVD: Cascaded Dense-view Video Diffusion Model for High-quality 4D Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04467)
*Shuzhou Yang,Xiaodong Cun,Xiaoyu Li,Yaowei Li,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4DVD is a cascaded video diffusion model that decouples 4D content generation into layout prediction and structure-aware generation, achieving high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly generating high-dimensional 4D data is complex, so 4DVD aims to simplify this by decoupling the process into manageable subtasks.

Method: 4DVD first predicts dense view layouts, then uses these priors for structure-aware spatio-temporal generation, combining coarse structure with input video appearance.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and 4D generation, validated on the D-Objaverse dataset.

Conclusion: 4DVD effectively simplifies 4D generation, enabling accurate optimization of 4D representations and practical applications.

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

### [165] [Zero-Residual Concept Erasure via Progressive Alignment in Text-to-Image Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04472)
*Hongxu Chen,Zhen Wang,Taoran Mei,Lin Li,Bowei Zhu,Runshi Li,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ErasePro improves concept erasure in text-to-image models by enforcing zero-residual alignment and progressive layer-wise updates, addressing incomplete erasure and quality degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for concept erasure in text-to-image models suffer from incomplete erasure and generative quality degradation due to non-zero alignment residuals and concentrated parameter updates in deep layers.

Method: ErasePro introduces a zero-residual constraint for perfect alignment and employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy to transfer target concept features gradually from shallow to deep layers.

Result: Empirical results show ErasePro's effectiveness in tasks like instance, art style, and nudity erasure, achieving more complete erasure and better generative quality.

Conclusion: ErasePro outperforms existing methods by ensuring complete concept erasure and preserving generative quality through its innovative optimization approach.

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

*Bowen Chai,Zheng Chen,Libo Zhu,Wenbo Li,Yong Guo,Yulun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantVSR introduces a low-bit quantization method for video super-resolution (VSR) models, addressing challenges like temporal characteristics and high fidelity requirements with spatio-temporal complexity awareness and learnable bias alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for VSR are resource-heavy and slow, limiting practical use. Quantization can help but is challenging due to VSR's unique demands.

Method: Proposes QuantVSR with a spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism and learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to optimize low-bit quantization.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to full-precision models and surpasses other low-bit quantization methods.

Conclusion: QuantVSR effectively balances efficiency and performance, making VSR models more practical for deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

### [167] [Learning Robust Intervention Representations with Delta Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04492)
*Panagiotis Alimisis,Christos Diou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Causal Delta Embeddings for representing interventions in causal learning, improving OOD robustness without extra supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work focuses on scene variables, but lacks intervention representations, which are key for OOD robustness.

Method: Introduces Causal Delta Embeddings—invariant to scenes and sparse in affected variables—learned from image pairs without supervision.

Result: Outperforms baselines in OOD settings on synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: Focusing on intervention representations enhances OOD robustness in causal learning.

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoCloth reconstructs and animates clothed human avatars from monocular videos using part-based decomposition and a dedicated cloth simulation module, improving quality and realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in limited geometric information and complex non-rigid motion in monocular videos, necessitating a specialized approach for realistic 3D human avatar reconstruction.

Method: MonoCloth decomposes the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing, focusing on detailed geometry for face/hands and a cloth simulation module for garments.

Result: MonoCloth outperforms existing methods in visual reconstruction quality and animation realism, also enabling tasks like clothing transfer.

Conclusion: MonoCloth's part-based design and cloth simulation enhance realism and versatility, making it practical for avatar reconstruction and animation.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

### [169] [Skeleton Motion Words for Unsupervised Skeleton-Based Temporal Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04513)
*Uzay Gökay,Federico Spurio,Dominik R. Bach,Juergen Gall*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unsupervised method for skeleton-based temporal action segmentation using a sequence-to-sequence autoencoder and motion word quantization, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised methods focus on video data, neglecting skeleton sequences despite their practical advantages like robustness and privacy. Annotated data is costly, motivating unsupervised approaches.

Method: Uses a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder to disentangle joint information in embeddings. Latent sequences are divided into patches and quantized into motion words for action clustering.

Result: Evaluated on HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL datasets, the method outperforms current unsupervised state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the gap in unsupervised skeleton-based action segmentation, offering a robust and privacy-preserving solution.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based
datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our
model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAIDX is a new deepfake detection framework combining RAG and GRPO for better accuracy and explainability, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of transparency and explainability in current deepfake detection methods, which rely on classification without clear decision explanations.

Method: RAIDX integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for improved accuracy and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for fine-grained explanations and saliency maps, avoiding manual annotations.

Result: RAIDX achieves state-of-the-art performance in detection and provides interpretable rationales via text and saliency maps.

Conclusion: RAIDX successfully combines RAG and GRPO to enhance deepfake detection accuracy and transparency, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised segmentation methods from computer vision don't perform well in medical imaging, necessitating a tailored approach.

Method: Fine-tunes pre-trained models for medical images and uses Explainable AI to generate relevance scores for segmentation.

Result: Achieves improved segmentation accuracy on medical datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg, and Kvasir-SEG.

Conclusion: The approach successfully adapts pre-trained models for medical imaging, outperforming traditional methods in this domain.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for modern healthcare and is a key
element of computer-aided diagnosis. While recent advancements in computer
vision have explored unsupervised segmentation using pre-trained models, these
methods have not been translated well to the medical imaging domain. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that fine-tunes pre-trained models
specifically for medical images, achieving accurate segmentation with extensive
processing. Our method integrates Explainable AI to generate relevance scores,
enhancing the segmentation process. Unlike traditional methods that excel in
standard benchmarks but falter in medical applications, our approach achieves
improved results on datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg and Kvasir-SEG.

TL;DR: TopKD enhances logit-based distillation by focusing on Top-K knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without extra modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge distillation methods overlook critical information in teacher logit distributions, particularly Top-K knowledge.

Method: Proposes TopKD with a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM) and Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL) for adaptive logit amplification and targeted supervision.

Result: TopKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets like CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and Tiny-ImageNet, including with Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: Logits hold significant potential for advancing knowledge distillation, as demonstrated by TopKD's effectiveness and versatility.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

TL;DR: InceptoFormer is a neural framework combining Inception1D and Transformer for Parkinson's Disease severity evaluation via gait analysis, achieving 96.6% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve PD severity assessment by capturing multi-scale temporal features and addressing class imbalance in gait data.

Method: Uses Inception1D for multi-scale feature extraction and Transformer for long-range dependencies, with oversampling for class imbalance.

Result: Achieves 96.6% accuracy, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer effectively evaluates PD severity by analyzing gait dynamics, offering a robust solution.

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a hierarchical event memory framework for online video temporal grounding (OnVTG) to improve event modeling and retain long-term historical information, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OnVTG models lack effective event modeling and long-term historical information retention, leading to low performance.

Method: Introduces a hierarchical event memory framework with event proposals and a future prediction branch for real-time event detection.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations in OnVTG by improving event modeling and historical information retention.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning datasets fail to handle the complexities of marine environments, limiting insights into marine life.

Method: A two-stage pipeline using video, text, and segmentation masks, with video splitting for detecting salient object transitions.

Result: Improved marine video understanding, analysis, and generation, with enriched captioning semantics.

Conclusion: The proposed method and dataset advance marine video captioning and understanding, with publicly released resources.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Two-Way Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), a unified framework for joint virtual try-on (VTON) and virtual try-off (VTOFF) tasks, addressing their complementary symmetry through bidirectional feature disentanglement and a phased training paradigm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works treat VTON and VTOFF as isolated tasks, neglecting their complementary symmetry. The paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a unified framework.

Method: The TWGTM employs dual-conditioned guidance from latent and pixel spaces and a phased training paradigm to resolve mask dependency asymmetry.

Result: Experiments on DressCode and VITON-HD datasets show the model's efficacy and competitive performance.

Conclusion: The TWGTM successfully unifies VTON and VTOFF, demonstrating improved performance and addressing the limitations of isolated task approaches.

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for whole heart segmentation using balanced joint training and strong augmentation to handle domain shifts, achieving high accuracy in CT and MR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death, necessitating advanced methods for cardiac structure analysis from medical images to aid in personalized therapy and digital twin models.

Method: Employs balanced joint training (CT and MR data) and strong intensity/spatial augmentation to address domain shifts, using a 5-fold ensemble for segmentation.

Result: Achieves 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT, and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, outperforming or matching domain-specific models.

Conclusion: The method shows promise for accurate semantic segmentation, enabling patient-specific cardiac digital twin models for personalized therapy.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With

### [178] [One Model For All: Partial Diffusion for Unified Try-On and Try-Off in Any Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04559)
*Jinxi Liu,Zijian He,Guangrun Wang,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OMFA is a unified diffusion framework for virtual try-on and try-off, eliminating the need for exhibition garments and supporting arbitrary poses. It uses partial diffusion for dynamic control and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, limiting flexibility in pose variations and real-world practicality.

Method: OMFA employs a partial diffusion strategy for selective noise and denoising, enabling bidirectional garment-person transformation without masks. It uses SMPL-X-based pose conditioning.

Result: OMFA achieves state-of-the-art performance in try-on and try-off tasks, supporting multi-view and arbitrary-pose synthesis from a single image.

Conclusion: OMFA provides a practical, mask-free solution for virtual garment synthesis, generalizing well across tasks and poses.

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

*Gabriele Magrini,Lorenzo Berlincioni,Luca Cultrera,Federico Becattini,Pietro Pala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event-based vision offers a robust solution for drone detection, overcoming limitations of traditional cameras by eliminating motion blur and excelling in extreme lighting. It enables low-latency, efficient counter-UAV systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional surveillance systems fail to reliably detect drones due to their small size, agility, and motion blur. Event-based vision addresses these challenges.

Method: The paper surveys event-based vision, reviewing data representation methods and processing pipelines like spiking neural networks for drone detection, tracking, and identification.

Result: Event cameras outperform traditional systems by providing consistent detection, suppressing static backgrounds, and enabling real-time tasks like tracking and trajectory forecasting.

Conclusion: Event-based vision is a powerful foundation for next-gen counter-UAV systems, offering reliability, low latency, and efficiency.

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

### [180] [TAlignDiff: Automatic Tooth Alignment assisted by Diffusion-based Transformation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04565)
*Yunbi Liu,Enqi Tang,Shiyu Li,Lei Ma,Juncheng Li,Shu Lou,Yongchu Pan,Qingshan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAlignDiff introduces a diffusion-based method for automatic tooth alignment, combining point cloud regression and transformation matrix denoising for improved orthodontic treatment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods for tooth alignment rely on deterministic geometric constraints, missing anatomical structure and distribution characteristics of transformation matrices.

Method: TAlignDiff uses a point cloud-based regression network (PRN) for alignment and a diffusion-based denoising module (DTMD) to learn transformation matrix distributions.

Result: The method outperforms prior approaches, demonstrating effectiveness and superiority in orthodontic applications.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff's unified framework, integrating geometric constraints and diffusion refinement, shows promise for advancing tooth alignment in orthodontics.

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

*Jinxing Zhou,Ziheng Zhou,Yanghao Zhou,Yuxin Mao,Zhangling Duan,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces W-DAVEL, a weakly-supervised task for localizing audio-visual events in videos using cross-modal salient anchors and achieves state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of localizing events in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels, where temporal boundaries are unknown.

Method: Proposes a Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation module and Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification to exploit reliable timestamps with consistent event semantics across audio and visual modalities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets.

Conclusion: The method effectively enhances event semantic encoding and improves temporal localization under weak supervision.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDTracking is a deep generative framework for diffusion MRI tractography, using a dual-pathway encoding network and conditional diffusion model to outperform state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve tractography by capturing fine-scale structural details and ensuring long-range consistency in streamline propagation.

Method: Introduces a dual-pathway encoding network for local and global modeling, combined with a conditional diffusion model for end-to-end tractography.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks (ISMRM Challenge and TractoInferno) and shows strong generalizability across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: DDTracking provides anatomically plausible, robust, and scalable tractography, adaptable for broad dMRI applications.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad
dMRI applications. Code is available at:

*Jun Li,Che Liu,Wenjia Bai,Mingxuan Liu,Rossella Arcucci,Cosmin I. Bercea,Julia A. Schnabel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: K2Sight introduces structured semantic supervision to localize clinical findings in medical images using interpretable visual attributes, achieving efficient training and competitive performance with smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist VLMs struggle in the medical domain due to rare and domain-specific terms, while specialized medical VLMs require extensive resources. K2Sight aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Decomposes clinical concepts into visual attributes (shape, density, location) and uses instruction-style prompts for region-text alignment, enabling data-efficient training.

Result: Compact models (0.23B and 2B parameters) trained with 1.5% of data outperform or match 7B+ medical VLMs, with up to 9.82% improvement in mAP50.

Conclusion: K2Sight effectively combines domain knowledge and spatial structure, offering a resource-efficient solution for medical image grounding.

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep learning framework for skin disease classification, evaluating pre-processing techniques and models, with DinoV2 and RGB achieving the best results (93% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin disease classification is challenging due to inter-class similarity and complex textures, requiring robust CAD systems.

Method: Evaluates RGB, CMY, and CLAHE pre-processing techniques with pre-trained CNNs (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformers (ViT, Swin, DinoV2).

Result: DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves 93% accuracy and high F1-scores, with Grad-CAM showing precise lesion localization.

Conclusion: Effective pre-processing and model choice are crucial for robust and explainable dermatology CAD systems.

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

Motivation: Half of the world's population is bilingual, and multilingual communication is common, making face-voice association in such scenarios important.

Method: The challenge uses the MAV-Celeb dataset and baseline models to study face-voice association in multilingual settings.

Result: Details of the challenge, dataset, baseline models, and tasks are provided.

Conclusion: The FAME Challenge aims to advance understanding of face-voice correlation in multilingual environments.

Abstract: The advancements of technology have led to the use of multimodal systems in
various real-world applications. Among them, audio-visual systems are among the
most widely used multimodal systems. In the recent years, associating face and
voice of a person has gained attention due to the presence of unique
correlation between them. The Face-voice Association in Multilingual
Environments (FAME) 2026 Challenge focuses on exploring face-voice association
under the unique condition of a multilingual scenario. This condition is
inspired from the fact that half of the world's population is bilingual and
most often people communicate under multilingual scenarios. The challenge uses

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM and feed-forward pose prediction, improving speed and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for 3D reconstruction from pose-free RGB streams struggle with long sequences or rely on slow optimization and depth sensors.

Method: Integrates a depth estimator into RGB-D SLAM, uses 3D Gaussian mapping for accuracy, and combines it with feed-forward pose prediction from optical flow.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to SplaTAM while reducing tracking time by over 90%.

Conclusion: The method offers a faster, robust solution for real-time 3D reconstruction without depth sensors.

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

TL;DR: OmniDepth unifies monocular and stereo depth estimation by iteratively aligning their latent representations, improving accuracy and addressing ambiguities like reflective surfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular and stereo depth estimation have complementary strengths and weaknesses, but current methods remain disjoint. OmniDepth aims to bridge this gap for more robust 3D perception.

Method: OmniDepth uses iterative bidirectional alignment and a cross-attentive mechanism to synchronize monocular contextual cues with stereo hypotheses, refining depth estimation.

Result: OmniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing zero-shot generalization error by >40% on benchmarks like Middlebury and ETH3D, and handles reflective/transparent surfaces better.

Conclusion: OmniDepth harmonizes monocular and stereo approaches, overcoming modality-specific limitations and enabling more accurate and robust depth estimation.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how bilateral ear symmetry affects CNN-based ear recognition, showing that treating left and right ears separately improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of bilateral ear symmetry on CNN-based ear recognition, as it has been overlooked in recent studies.

Method: Developed an ear side classifier to categorize ears as left or right, then evaluated the impact of side information during training and testing across five datasets.

Result: Separate treatment of left and right ears during training and testing leads to notable performance improvements.

Conclusion: Incorporating side information and optimizing alignment strategies, input sizes, and hyperparameters can enhance CNN-based ear recognition systems.

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:
FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance,
banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in
financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The

that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EncQA is a new benchmark for chart understanding, revealing gaps in VLMs' visual reasoning despite their progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs' progress on chart understanding benchmarks doesn't fully address essential visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduces EncQA, a benchmark with 2,076 synthetic QA pairs covering 6 visual encodings and 8 tasks, evaluated on 9 VLMs.

Result: Performance varies across encodings and tasks, with no improvement from model size for many cases.

Conclusion: Targeted strategies, not just scaling models or data, are needed to advance chart understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

TL;DR: X-SAM is a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that enhances pixel-level perceptual understanding, addressing limitations of SAM in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation. It introduces a unified framework and a new task, VGD segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models like SAM lack multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation capabilities, and fail to unify all segmentation tasks. X-SAM aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: X-SAM introduces a unified framework for advanced pixel-level comprehension and a new VGD segmentation task. It employs a unified training strategy for diverse datasets.

Result: X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating superior multimodal visual understanding.

Conclusion: X-SAM successfully extends segmentation capabilities, offering a unified solution for diverse tasks and improving pixel-level perceptual understanding in MLLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

is laborious and prone to mistakes. Using YOLO v8 a deep learning model for
real-time object recognition. This study suggests an AI based approach, by
developing a system that analyzes high resolution chicken photos, YOLO v8
detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A
sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides
accurate real-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to
farm operators for prompt action. By facilitating early infection
identification, eliminating the need for human inspection, and enhancing
biosecurity in large-scale farms, this AI technology improves chicken health
management. The real-time features of YOLO v8 provide a scalable and effective
method for improving farm management techniques.

### [193] [PixCuboid: Room Layout Estimation from Multi-view Featuremetric Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04659)
*Gustav Hanning,Kalle Åström,Viktor Larsson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixCuboid is an optimization-based method for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation using multi-view alignment of deep features, outperforming single-view methods and extending to multi-room scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current room layout estimation methods rely on single views and panoramic images, limiting accuracy and flexibility. PixCuboid addresses this by leveraging multi-view alignment.

Method: PixCuboid uses dense deep features and end-to-end training to optimize room layout estimation, enabling large convergence basins and smooth loss landscapes. Simple heuristics initialize the layout.

Result: PixCuboid outperforms competitors on new benchmarks (ScanNet++ and 2D-3D-Semantics) with verified ground truth. It also extends to multi-room estimation.

Conclusion: PixCuboid offers a flexible, optimization-based solution for accurate room layout estimation, scalable to multi-room scenarios, with publicly available code and models.

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

*Young D. Kwon,Rui Li,Sijia Li,Da Li,Sourav Bhattacharya,Stylianos I. Venieris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HierarchicalPrune compresses billion-scale text-to-image diffusion models for on-device use, reducing memory and latency while preserving output quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Massive parameter scales (8-11B) in diffusion models hinder inference on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Combines Hierarchical Position Pruning, Positional Weight Preservation, and Sensitivity-Guided Distillation to compress models.

Result: Achieves 77.5-80.4% memory reduction, 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, with minimal quality drop.

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune enables efficient on-device inference without significant quality loss, outperforming prior methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

### [195] [ANPrompt: Anti-noise Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04677)
*Yansheng Gao,Yufei Zheng,Jinghan Qu,Zixi Zhu,Yukuan Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANPrompt is a prompt tuning framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that enhances robustness against weak semantic perturbations by integrating noise prompts and noise-resistant visual prototypes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-tuned VLMs are vulnerable to subtle semantic noise, degrading their generalization to unseen classes. ANPrompt addresses this limitation.

Method: ANPrompt constructs noise prompts by fusing original and perturbed text embeddings, integrates them with learnable tokens, and computes noise-resistant visual prototypes. It uses alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives.

Result: ANPrompt outperforms existing methods on 11 benchmarks, showing superior robustness to semantic noise and better generalization to novel categories.

Conclusion: ANPrompt effectively enhances the robustness of prompt-tuned VLMs against weak semantic perturbations, improving generalization performance.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces InterVLA, a large-scale dataset for human-object-human interaction, combining generalist knowledge and egocentric vision. It includes multimodal data and benchmarks for AI agent development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets lack generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality, which are crucial for AI assistants.

Method: A hybrid RGB-MoCap system captures interactions following GPT-generated scripts, creating a multimodal dataset (InterVLA) with egocentric and exocentric views.

Result: InterVLA contains 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of data, with benchmarks for motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and prediction.

Conclusion: InterVLA and its benchmarks aim to advance AI agent development for real-world interactions.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboTrain is an efficient training framework for multi-agent systems, combining spatiotemporal pretraining and balanced multi-task learning to improve performance and reduce manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training multi-agent systems is challenging and requires extensive manual design. TurboTrain aims to simplify this process and enhance performance.

Method: TurboTrain uses masked reconstruction learning for spatiotemporal pretraining and gradient conflict suppression for balanced multi-task learning.

Result: The framework improves performance on the V2XPnP-Seq dataset, showing better multi-agent perception and prediction.

Conclusion: TurboTrain effectively captures spatiotemporal features and enhances downstream tasks, reducing training complexity and time.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEVCon is a contrastive learning framework for BEV perception in autonomous driving, improving feature representation and achieving +2.4% mAP gain on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance BEV perception by addressing the underexplored potential of representation learning, complementing existing encoder and task-specific optimizations.

Method: Introduces two contrastive learning modules: instance feature contrast for BEV features and perspective view contrast for the image backbone, combined with detection losses.

Result: Achieves up to +2.4% mAP improvement on nuScenes, demonstrating better feature representation.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of representation learning in BEV perception as a complementary approach to task-specific optimizations.

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

### [199] [Occupancy Learning with Spatiotemporal Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04705)
*Ziyang Leng,Jiawei Yang,Wenlong Yi,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ST-Occ is a framework for learning spatiotemporal features in 3D occupancy prediction, improving efficiency and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in aggregating 3D occupancy over time due to high processing cost and voxel uncertainty/dynamics.

Method: Uses a spatiotemporal memory and memory attention to capture historical info and condition current occupancy.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art by 3 mIoU and reduces temporal inconsistency by 29%.

Conclusion: ST-Occ effectively enhances spatiotemporal representation for 3D occupancy prediction.

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

*Minsuk Chang,Yao Wang,Huichen Will Wang,Yuanhong Zhou,Andreas Bulling,Cindy Xiong Bearfield*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper shows how visual literacy levels affect attention patterns in visualization interpretation and introduces two models, Lit2Sal and Sal2Lit, to predict attention and literacy, respectively, improving personalized visualization design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked variation in visual attention behavior based on visual literacy levels and improve visualization effectiveness by accounting for individual differences.

Method: Conducted a 235-participant user study with three visualization tests (mini-VLAT, CALVI, SGL) and developed two computational models: Lit2Sal (predicts attention based on literacy) and Sal2Lit (predicts literacy from attention data).

Result: Lit2Sal outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models, and Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single attention map in under a minute.

Conclusion: The approach advances personalized visualization design by integrating individual differences in salience models and literacy assessments, enhancing visual data communication.

Abstract: Accounting for individual differences can improve the effectiveness of
visualization design. While the role of visual attention in visualization
interpretation is well recognized, existing work often overlooks how this
behavior varies based on visual literacy levels. Based on data from a
235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT,
CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data
exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts
(high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers)
focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models
leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal -- a novel visual saliency model that
predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and
Sal2Lit -- a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data.
Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal
outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware
considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single
attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment
that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to
consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in
literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual
data communication to enhance understanding.

*Angela Locoro,Silvia Golia,Davide Falessi*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DRIVE-T is a methodology for designing and evaluating assessment items in data visualization literacy, focusing on discriminability and representativeness of tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underspecification of difficulty levels in measurement constructs hinders expressivity in test design and reuse.

Method: DRIVE-T involves tagging, rating, and analyzing task-based items using a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model.

Result: The methodology identifies difficulty levels of measurement constructs, validated through a pilot study.

Conclusion: DRIVE-T provides an inductive, practice-based approach for formative assessment in data visualization literacy.

Abstract: The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement
constructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may
hinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To
mitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and
Representative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed
to drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data
vizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items
discriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data
visualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based
items associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by
independent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores
through a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the
emergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the
discriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data
vizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we
show and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the
difficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct
for data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from
semiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that
each data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T
methodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design
phase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based
measurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the
application of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.

TL;DR: RoboTron-Sim enhances autonomous driving in critical scenarios using simulated hard cases, achieving 50% better performance in challenging situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data for rare high-risk driving scenarios is scarce, limiting autonomous driving systems' performance in critical situations.

Method: Develops HASS dataset with 13 high-risk edge-case categories and introduces SPE and I2E Encoder to adapt multimodal models to real-world challenges.

Result: Improves driving performance by ~50% in challenging scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art results in real-world open-loop planning.

Conclusion: RoboTron-Sim effectively manages rare high-risk driving scenarios, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk
driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A framework for collecting clinical images and data for AI training and validation is described, emphasizing ethics, governance, and infrastructure for safe and shareable data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI tools are trained and validated on up-to-date, representative datasets, combining older cases with long-term follow-up and current data for accurate clinical outcomes.

Method: The framework supports automated, ongoing data collection for large-scale, long-term use, with alternatives like semi-automated methods for smaller or initial projects.

Result: Enables creation of datasets that reflect current practice, improving AI tool validation by using relevant, recent data.

Conclusion: Automated collection is ideal for large-scale projects, but semi-automated methods can be a starting point, ensuring flexibility and practicality in data collection.

Abstract: In this report a framework for the collection of clinical images and data for
use when training and validating artificial intelligence (AI) tools is
described. The report contains not only information about the collection of the
images and clinical data, but the ethics and information governance processes
to consider ensuring the data is collected safely, and the infrastructure and
agreements required to allow for the sharing of data with other groups.
  A key characteristic of the main collection framework described here is that
it can enable automated and ongoing collection of datasets to ensure that the
data is up-to-date and representative of current practice. This is important in
the context of training and validating AI tools as it is vital that datasets
have a mix of older cases with long term follow-up such that the clinical
outcome is as accurate as possible, and current data. Validations run on old
data will provide findings and conclusions relative to the status of the
imaging units when that data was generated. It is important that a validation
dataset can assess the AI tools with data that it would see if deployed and
active now.
  Other types of collection frameworks, which do not follow a fully automated
approach, are also described. Whilst the fully automated method is recommended
for large scale, long-term image collection, there may be reasons to start data
collection using semi-automated methods and indications of how to do that are
provided.

Motivation: Addressing the global health challenge of visual impairment by leveraging multimodal imaging for accurate ophthalmic diagnosis.

Method: Systematic review of multimodal deep learning, including task-specific approaches (e.g., lesion detection) and foundation models (e.g., vision-language architectures).

Result: Identifies key datasets, metrics, and innovations like self-supervised learning, while highlighting challenges like data variability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Future directions include ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning for clinically applicable AI systems.

Abstract: Visual impairment represents a major global health challenge, with multimodal
imaging providing complementary information that is essential for accurate
ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the
latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the
year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal
approaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific
approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion
detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a
variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical
coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models
combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models
pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust
cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision
support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics,
and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning,
attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing
challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of
interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient
populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that
emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based
reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically
applicable AI systems for ophthalmology.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel loss function and regularization term for automated retinal vessel segmentation and artery/vein classification, improving accuracy by enforcing consistency and fine-grained feature extraction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual segmentation and classification of retinal vessels are time-consuming and inconsistent, while existing automated methods treat artery, vein, and vessel segmentation as separate tasks, ignoring their intrinsic relationships.

Method: Introduces a Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss for coherence between vessel, artery, and vein predictions and an intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss for fine-grained feature representation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on three public datasets (RITE, LES-AV, HRF).

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the limitations of existing approaches by leveraging anatomical relationships and improving feature discrimination.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for
the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying
segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction
of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity,
which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive
retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are
time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional
Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this
challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods
all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary
tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical
structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall
retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it,
we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce
the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions,
avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks.
Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level
contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained
representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been
achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV
and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes an automated bone fracture detection framework using a modified VGG-19 model with preprocessing techniques and Grad-CAM for interpretability, achieving high accuracy and fast diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate bone fracture detection is critical for timely treatment, but current methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack interpretability.

Method: Uses a modified VGG-19 model with CLAHE, Otsu's thresholding, and Canny edge detection for preprocessing, and Grad-CAM for explainability.

Result: Achieves 99.78% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, with real-time feedback in 0.5 seconds.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reliable, fast, and interpretable solution for bone fracture detection, improving patient care.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating
treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and
outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone
task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of
radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently,
typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to
clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated
framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our
needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding,
and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to
facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable
AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making
process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the
model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further
clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where
healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic
feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model
attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it
exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable
solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for
diagnoses and better patient care.

*Weiwei Cao,Jianpeng Zhang,Zhongyi Shui,Sinuo Wang,Zeli Chen,Xi Li,Le Lu,Xianghua Ye,Tingbo Liang,Qi Zhang,Ling Zhang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes enhancing vision-language pre-training (VLP) for medical diagnostics by boosting visual semantic density to bridge the gap between low-SNR medical images and high-SNR reports. Methods include disease-level contrastive learning and anatomical normality modeling, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the semantic density gap between medical images and reports to improve alignment and diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Disease-level vision contrastive learning and anatomical normality modeling using VQ-VAE for normal vision embedding reconstruction.

Result: Achieved an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, outperforming existing methods. Demonstrated superior transfer learning capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances visual representation for better alignment with diagnostic reports, improving diagnostic performance and transferability.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing
multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning
medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high
SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this
paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment
effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level
vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to
differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical
structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling
method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging
VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This
process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in
abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of
abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures
the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate
alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two
chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset,
MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across
multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average
AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing
methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning
capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at

### [208] [Do We Need Pre-Processing for Deep Learning Based Ultrasound Shear Wave Elastography?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03744)
*Sarah Grube,Sören Grünhagen,Sarah Latus,Michael Meyling,Alexander Schlaefer*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning-based ultrasound shear wave elastography can reliably differentiate tissue elasticity using raw data, reducing reliance on pre-processing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the necessity of ultrasound pre-processing for deep learning-based elastography and improve standardization across systems.

Method: A 3D convolutional neural network predicts shear wave velocities from varying degrees of pre-processed ultrasound images, compared to a conventional time-of-flight method.

Result: Deep learning reliably differentiates elasticity groups, even with raw data, though pre-processing slightly improves performance.

Conclusion: Deep learning reduces bias from pre-processing, enabling faster, more reliable clinical elasticity assessments.

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for
various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a
non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across
different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the
influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent
literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on
reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the
need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound
shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional
neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal
ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input
images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw
radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach
to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with
different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant
differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups,
regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly
improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach
can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed
radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches
could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing
steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable
clinical elasticity assessments.

*Yajun Liu,Zenghui Zhang,Jiang Yue,Weiwei Guo,Dongying Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces M³HL, a method combining dynamic masking (M³) and hierarchical feature consistency (HL) to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation, outperforming benchmarks like ACDC and LA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CutMix-based methods are inflexible and lack feature-level consistency, limiting their effectiveness in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Method: M³HL uses M³ for dynamic masking and HL for hierarchical feature consistency, enhancing information fusion and feature representation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ACDC and LA datasets.

Conclusion: M³HL addresses limitations of rigid CutMix methods and improves segmentation accuracy through flexible masking and feature consistency.

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant
potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However,
these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible
manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency
constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix
with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned
challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data
augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image
Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically
adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for
collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between
labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization
framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between
unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative
feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA
datasets. Source code is available at https://github.com/PHPJava666/M3HL

*Trung-tin Dinh,Hervé Carfantan,Antoine Monmayrant,Simon Lacroix*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: An unsupervised classification method for DD-CASSI hyperspectral data is proposed, identifying classes and estimating spectra despite high compression. It critiques current ground truths and demonstrates improved spectral coherence in the Pavia University scene.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing ground truths in evaluating unsupervised classification methods, such as unclear class definitions and high intra-class variability.

Method: Uses a simple model of intra-class spectral variability to classify and estimate reference spectra from compressed DD-CASSI hyperspectral data.

Result: The method successfully identifies spectrally coherent regions in the Pavia University scene, despite data compression.

Conclusion: Highlights the need to rethink evaluation metrics for unsupervised classification methods due to flaws in current ground truths.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised classification method using a limited number of
coded acquisitions from a DD-CASSI hyperspectral imager. Based on a simple
model of intra-class spectral variability, this approach allow to identify
classes and estimate reference spectra, despite data compression by a factor of
ten. Here, we highlight the limitations of the ground truths commonly used to
evaluate this type of method: lack of a clear definition of the notion of
class, high intra-class variability, and even classification errors. Using the
Pavia University scene, we show that with simple assumptions, it is possible to
detect regions that are spectrally more coherent, highlighting the need to
rethink the evaluation of classification methods, particularly in unsupervised
scenarios.

*Akwasi Asare,Mary Sagoe,Justice Williams Asare*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FUTransUNet, a hybrid model combining Vision Transformers and U-Net, improves diabetic foot ulcer segmentation by integrating global and local features, achieving high accuracy and clinical interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) segmentation is challenging due to heterogeneous appearance and complex backgrounds. Traditional CNNs like U-Net lack long-range spatial dependency modeling.

Method: Proposed FUTransUNet integrates Vision Transformers' global attention with U-Net's localization, using skip connections and decoding for fine-grained resolution. Trained on the FUSeg dataset.

Result: Achieved Dice Coefficient of 0.8751 and IoU of 0.7780 on validation set, with Grad-CAM visualizations for explainability.

Conclusion: FUTransUNet provides a robust, accurate, and clinically interpretable solution for DFU segmentation, enhancing wound assessment and patient care.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role
in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring.
However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance,
irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in
clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as
U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model
long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive
fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that
integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into
the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global
contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through
skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated
FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset.
FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672,
and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice
Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To
ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which
highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes
clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and
local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate,
explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution
for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable,
high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving
real-world wound assessment and patient care.

### [212] [Assessing the Impact of Image Super Resolution on White Blood Cell Classification Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03759)
*Tatwadarshi P. Nagarhalli,Shruti S. Pawar,Soham A. Dahanukar,Uday Aswalekar,Ashwini M. Save,Sanket D. Patil*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper explores how image super-resolution techniques improve white blood cell classification accuracy in low-resolution microscopic images using deep learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resolution microscopic images hinder accurate white blood cell classification, crucial for medical diagnostics. The study aims to enhance resolution and classification performance.

Method: The study employs image super-resolution to upscale images, integrates enhanced images into training, and evaluates performance using a deep learning model.

Result: The approach improves classification accuracy by capturing subtler morphological details in higher-resolution images.

Conclusion: Enhancing image resolution and combining standard and augmented data can optimize white blood cell classification models.

Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential
to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep
learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify
images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures
is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some
picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being
utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The
suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how
picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study
specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more
complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when
image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may
learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are
incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend
the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification
accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct
extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.
This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms
customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the
trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.

TL;DR: The study validates the PI-CAI-2B AI model for detecting Gleason grade group ≥2 prostate cancer on MRI, using a large, diverse dataset from 22 countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve prostate cancer detection by developing and validating an efficient AI model (PI-CAI-2B) against standard clinical assessments.

Method: Retrospective cohort study with 22,481 MRI exams from 21,288 patients across 46 cities. Training/internal testing used 20,471 cases; external testing used 2,010 cases from diverse settings.

Result: Primary endpoint measures agreement between AI and standard care diagnoses (expert uropathologists/radiologists). Secondary measures include AUROC to assess bias.

Conclusion: The PI-CAI-2B model shows potential for diagnostic interchangeability with standard care in detecting significant prostate cancer.

Abstract: In this intercontinental, confirmatory study, we include a retrospective
cohort of 22,481 MRI examinations (21,288 patients; 46 cities in 22 countries)
to train and externally validate the PI-CAI-2B model, i.e., an efficient,
next-generation iteration of the state-of-the-art AI system that was developed
for detecting Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer on MRI during the
PI-CAI study. Of these examinations, 20,471 cases (19,278 patients; 26 cities
in 14 countries) from two EU Horizon projects (ProCAncer-I, COMFORT) and 12
independent centers based in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, are used
for training and internal testing. Additionally, 2010 cases (2010 patients; 20
external cities in 12 countries) from population-based screening (STHLM3-MRI,
IP1-PROSTAGRAM trials) and primary diagnostic settings (PRIME trial) based in
Europe, North and South Americas, Asia and Australia, are used for external
testing. Primary endpoint is the proportion of AI-based assessments in
agreement with the standard of care diagnoses (i.e., clinical assessments made
by expert uropathologists on histopathology, if available, or at least two
expert urogenital radiologists in consensus; with access to patient history and
peer consultation) in the detection of Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate
cancer within the external testing cohorts. Our statistical analysis plan is
prespecified with a hypothesis of diagnostic interchangeability to the standard
of care at the PI-RADS $\geq$3 (primary diagnosis) or $\geq$4 (screening)
cut-off, considering an absolute margin of 0.05 and reader estimates derived
from the PI-CAI observer study (62 radiologists reading 400 cases). Secondary
measures comprise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUROC) of the AI system stratified by imaging quality, patient age and patient
ethnicity to identify underlying biases (if any).

*Emanuele Nardone,Tiziana D'Alessandro,Francesco Fontanella,Claudio De Stefano*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning models (LSTM, GRU, RNN) underperform traditional methods in non-invasive Alzheimer's detection via handwriting analysis due to data representation mismatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore non-invasive Alzheimer's detection using handwriting analysis, avoiding costly or invasive procedures.

Method: Evaluated three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) and traditional machine learning models on a dataset of 34 handwriting tasks from healthy and Alzheimer's patients.

Result: Traditional ensemble methods outperformed deep learning models, which showed poor specificity and high variance due to mismatched data representation.

Conclusion: Recurrent architectures fail with discrete stroke features, highlighting the need for better data-model compatibility in future research.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive
procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning
can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting
analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from
healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare
three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional
machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the
recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw
temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow
that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they
exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods
significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with
balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for
continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted
from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning
models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural
assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting
data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical
issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable
directions for future research.

TL;DR: UNISELF, a deep learning method, improves MS lesion segmentation by optimizing in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization using test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion and instance normalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DL methods for MS lesion segmentation struggle with balancing in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization, especially with limited single-source data.

Method: UNISELF uses test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion and test-time instance normalization (TTIN) to handle domain shifts and missing contrasts.

Result: UNISELF ranks among the best on the ISBI 2015 test dataset and outperforms benchmarks on diverse out-of-domain datasets (MICCAI 2016, UMCL, private multisite).

Conclusion: UNISELF effectively addresses domain shifts and missing contrasts, achieving high accuracy and generalization in MS lesion segmentation.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using multicontrast
magnetic resonance (MR) images improves efficiency and reproducibility compared
to manual delineation, with deep learning (DL) methods achieving
state-of-the-art performance. However, these DL-based methods have yet to
simultaneously optimize in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization
when trained on a single source with limited data, or their performance has
been unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, we propose a method called UNISELF,
which achieves high accuracy within a single training domain while
demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple out-of-domain test
datasets. UNISELF employs a novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion to
improve segmentation accuracy, and leverages test-time instance normalization
(TTIN) of latent features to address domain shifts and missing input contrasts.
Trained on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS segmentation challenge training
dataset, UNISELF ranks among the best-performing methods on the challenge test
dataset. Additionally, UNISELF outperforms all benchmark methods trained on the
same ISBI training data across diverse out-of-domain test datasets with domain
shifts and missing contrasts, including the public MICCAI 2016 and UMCL
datasets, as well as a private multisite dataset. These test datasets exhibit
domain shifts and/or missing contrasts caused by variations in acquisition
protocols, scanner types, and imaging artifacts arising from imperfect
acquisition. Our code is available at https://github.com/uponacceptance.

TL;DR: PET2Rep is introduced as the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in generating radiology reports for PET images, highlighting their current inadequacy despite advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs focus on structural imaging, neglecting PET's metabolic insights, necessitating a dedicated benchmark to address this gap and improve clinical utility.

Method: PET2Rep, a large-scale dataset with whole-body PET image-report pairs, is created. It evaluates 30 VLMs using clinical and natural language metrics.

Result: Current VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation, failing to meet practical clinical needs. Key insufficiencies are identified.

Conclusion: PET2Rep fills a critical gap, but VLMs require significant improvement to be clinically viable for PET report generation.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cornerstone of modern oncologic and
neurologic imaging, distinguished by its unique ability to illuminate dynamic
metabolic processes that transcend the anatomical focus of traditional imaging
technologies. Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet
their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent
advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in
medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report
generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have
predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique
characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To
bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for
evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET
images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report
generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body
image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in
existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In
addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce
a series of clinical efficiency metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer
uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a
head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and
medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art
VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short
of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency
that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.

TL;DR: MAEs are used to pre-train on unlabelled chest CT scans for diffused lung disease diagnosis, improving performance without large labelled datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotated imaging datasets for diffused lung disease are scarce, making MAEs a promising solution for learning robust features from unlabelled data.

Method: Train an MAE on 5,000+ chest CT scans (in-house and public data), then fine-tune for a classification task.

Result: MAEs effectively extract clinically meaningful features and enhance diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: MAEs are a powerful tool for diffused lung disease research, especially where labelled data is limited.

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
pre-training on unlabelled data, capable of learning robust and informative
feature representations. This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung
disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage
this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed
tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans
from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as
COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a
downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our
findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful
features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale
labelled datasets. The code and the models are available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image registration methods are limited to single-organ applications, restricting their broader clinical utility.

Method: The framework employs a standard UNet architecture and a novel field decomposition strategy, requiring only 11GB GPU memory.

Result: Outperforms baselines in multi-organ abdominal registration and achieves competitive results on external datasets without fine-tuning.

Conclusion: TotalRegistrator demonstrates strong generalizability and potential for clinical use in multi-organ image registration.

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental technique in the analysis of longitudinal
and multi-phase CT images within clinical practice. However, most existing
methods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their
generalizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents
TotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple
anatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a
novel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only
11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we
constructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body
(thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at
different time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic
classical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image
registration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated
our model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal
datasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal
dataset from a collaborating hospital. Experimental results on the in-house
dataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in
multi-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment
performance. On out-of-distribution datasets, it achieved competitive results
compared to leading single-organ models, despite not being fine-tuned for those
tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability. The source code will be publicly

TL;DR: A deep-learning framework for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases from MRI data, achieving high accuracy and real-time segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in fetal brain MRI assessment due to variability in maturation, imaging protocols, and gestational age estimates.

Method: Combines a direct registration model with a conditional discriminator, trained on 219 neurotypical fetal MRIs (21-37 weeks gestation).

Result: High registration accuracy, sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation (average DSC of 86.3%). Volumetric analysis reveals neurotypical growth trajectories.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for

to variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates
of Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a
standardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and
comparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common
coordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework
for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal
brain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model
with a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219
neurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method
achieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with
sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average
Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues.
Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed
neurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the
maturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized
developmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance,
supporting both research and clinical applications. The model code is available

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces LA-CaRe-CNN, a 2-stage CNN cascade for segmenting left atrium and scar tissue from LGE MR scans, achieving high accuracy for personalized AF ablation therapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve personalized ablation therapy for atrial fibrillation by accurately segmenting left atrium and scar tissue from LGE MR scans.

Method: Proposes LA-CaRe-CNN, a 2-stage 3D CNN cascade trained end-to-end with strong augmentation to handle domain shifts.

Result: Achieves 89.21% DSC for left atrium and 64.59% DSC for scar tissue, demonstrating high segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: LA-CaRe-CNN shows promise for creating patient-specific digital twin models and enhancing personalized AF treatment.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac
arrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation
therapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to
prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,
however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred
tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic
resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading
Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium
as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage
CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a
prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction
with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial
scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during
training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the
diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold
ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm
ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more
challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through
LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac
digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation
therapy to treat AF.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CX-Mind is a generative model for CXR diagnosis using interleaved reasoning and curriculum-based reinforcement learning, outperforming existing models by 25.1%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal models lack verifiable reasoning supervision, leading to inefficiencies in multi-task CXR diagnosis.

Method: Uses curriculum-based reinforcement learning (CuRL-VPR) and instruction-tuning dataset CX-Set for interleaved reasoning.

Result: Achieves 25.1% improvement over comparable models and superior performance on real-world clinical datasets.

Conclusion: CX-Mind enhances diagnostic efficiency and interpretability, validated by expert evaluations.

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic
modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic
tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of
reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to
enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing
multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches,
lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to
challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse
rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose
CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer"
reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and
verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an
instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148
samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points
supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under
the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic
reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain
diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the
need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain
MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment,
achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable
CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves
a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best
results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical
utility across multiple dimensions.

### [223] [GTPO: Trajectory-Based Policy Optimization in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03772)
*Marco Simoni,Aleksandar Fontana,Giulio Rossolini,Andrea Saracino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies limitations in GRPO (Group-relative Policy Optimization) and introduces GTPO (Group-relative Trajectory-based Policy Optimization) to address conflicting gradient updates and policy collapse, improving stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO has limitations: conflicting gradient updates for tokens with mixed rewards and policy collapse due to penalizing confident responses. These issues degrade learning and output quality.

Method: GTPO identifies conflict tokens, skips negative updates, amplifies positive ones, and filters high-entropy completions to prevent policy collapse. It avoids KL-divergence regularization.

Result: GTPO outperforms GRPO, ensuring greater stability and improved performance on benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH, and AIME 2024.

Conclusion: GTPO provides a more stable and effective policy optimization strategy, addressing GRPO's limitations without needing a reference model.

Abstract: Policy-based optimizations are widely adopted today for the training and
alignment of language models, where one of the most recent and effective
approaches is Group-relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). In this paper, we
reveals and analyze two major limitations of GRPO: (i) tokens frequently appear
in completions with both positive and negative rewards, leading to conflicting
gradient updates that can reduce their output probability, even though can be
essential for maintaining proper structure; (ii) negatively rewarded
completions may penalize confident responses and shift model decisions toward
unlikely tokens, progressively flattening the output distribution and degrading
learning. To address these issues and provide a more stable and effective
policy optimization strategy, we introduce GTPO (Group-relative
Trajectory-based Policy Optimization), which identifies conflict tokens, tokens
appearing in the same position across completions with opposite rewards,
protects them by skipping negative updates, while amplifying positive ones. To
further prevent policy collapse, GTPO filters out completions whose entropy
exceeds a provable threshold. Unlike GRPO, GTPO does not rely on KL-divergence
regularization, eliminating the need for a reference model during training,
while still ensuring greater training stability and improved performance,
validated through multiple experiments on GSM8K, MATH and AIME 2024 benchmarks.

*Jinghang Han,Jiawei Chen,Hang Shao,Hao Ma,Mingcheng Li,Xintian Shen,Lihao Zheng,Wei Chen,Tao Wei,Lihua Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a consistency-aware policy optimization framework to address vanishing gradients in reinforcement learning for LLMs, improving training efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of vanishing gradients when multiple responses under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes limits training efficiency and downstream performance.

Method: Introduces a structured global reward based on outcome consistency and an entropy-based soft blending mechanism to balance local and global optimization.

Result: Substantial performance gains on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and general applicability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses vanishing gradients and enhances reasoning capabilities in LLMs, validated by improved benchmark performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving tasks. Recently, the
introduction of DeepSeek R1 has inspired a surge of interest in leveraging
rule-based rewards as a low-cost alternative for computing advantage functions
and guiding policy optimization. However, a common challenge observed across
many replication and extension efforts is that when multiple sampled responses
under a single prompt converge to identical outcomes, whether correct or
incorrect, the group-based advantage degenerates to zero. This leads to
vanishing gradients and renders the corresponding samples ineffective for
learning, ultimately limiting training efficiency and downstream performance.
To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware policy optimization
framework that introduces a structured global reward based on outcome
consistency, the global loss based on it ensures that, even when model outputs
show high intra-group consistency, the training process still receives
meaningful learning signals, which encourages the generation of correct and
self-consistent reasoning paths from a global perspective. Furthermore, we
incorporate an entropy-based soft blending mechanism that adaptively balances
local advantage estimation with global optimization, enabling dynamic
transitions between exploration and convergence throughout training. Our method
introduces several key innovations in both reward design and optimization
strategy. We validate its effectiveness through substantial performance gains
on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, highlighting the proposed
framework's robustness and general applicability. Code of this work has been

### [225] [Causal Reflection with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04495)
*Abi Aryan,Zac Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal Reflection is a framework addressing LLMs' and RL agents' lack of robust causal reasoning by modeling causality dynamically and introducing a Reflect mechanism for self-correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs and RL agents often rely on spurious correlations and lack causal understanding, limiting their reasoning and adaptability.

Method: The framework models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, and includes a Reflect mechanism to revise internal models based on outcome mismatches.

Result: Enables agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects, adapt, and communicate causal understanding.

Conclusion: Causal Reflection provides a theoretical foundation for agents that self-correct and explain causality in dynamic environments.

Abstract: While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with
robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle
patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal
understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to
outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models
causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation,
enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we
define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted
and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's
internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners,
but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into
natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the
theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt,
self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GlaBoost is a multimodal framework combining clinical data, fundus images, and expert text for accurate, interpretable glaucoma detection, outperforming baselines with 98.71% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early glaucoma detection is vital to prevent vision loss, but current methods lack interpretability and rely on single data types.

Method: GlaBoost integrates clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert text using a pretrained encoder and transformer model, fusing them via enhanced XGBoost.

Result: Achieves 98.71% validation accuracy, with key features like cup-to-disc ratio and textual embeddings driving decisions.

Conclusion: GlaBoost provides a transparent, scalable solution for glaucoma diagnosis, extendable to other eye disorders.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible
vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present
GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured
clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual
descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual
representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained
convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using
a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with
manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused
into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model.
Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that
GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation
accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent
patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings
contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and
scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to
other ophthalmic disorders.

*Wenwu Gong,Lili Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes LRTuckerRep, a novel model unifying global low-rank and local smoothness priors for multi-dimensional data completion, outperforming baselines in accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-dimensional data completion have limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and disrupt data structures, while smoothness-based approaches require manual tuning and generalize poorly.

Method: Introduces LRTuckerRep, combining low-rank Tucker decomposition with self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm and parameter-free Laplacian-based regularization. Develops two iterative algorithms with convergence guarantees.

Result: LRTuckerRep achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates in experiments on image inpainting and traffic data imputation.

Conclusion: LRTuckerRep effectively unifies global and local priors, offering a robust and accurate solution for multi-dimensional data completion.

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational
sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing,
and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global
low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers
from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and
may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often
require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In
this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep)
model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker
decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a
self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker
core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based
regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting
nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with
provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional
image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep
achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates
compared to baselines.

TL;DR: FLAT is a novel backdoor attack in federated learning using a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to create diverse, target-specific triggers, evading detection and achieving high attack success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing backdoor attacks in FL are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them inflexible and easier to detect.

Method: FLAT leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to generate diverse, target-specific triggers, allowing arbitrary target selection without retraining.

Result: FLAT achieves high attack success and robustness against advanced FL defenses, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: The results emphasize the need for new defense strategies to counter latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in federated learning.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing
methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them
inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack),
a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder
to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a
latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable
triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and
to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack
success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new
level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive
experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust
against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new
defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in
federated settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a rehearsal-based continual learning method for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) in leukemia detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of updating machine learning models in dynamic lab/clinic environments without catastrophic forgetting, specifically for MIL in single-cell-based disease diagnosis.

Method: Uses instance attention scores and distance metrics to select and store diverse samples in exemplary sets from previous tasks.

Result: Outperforms existing continual learning methods in a class incremental scenario using real-world leukemia data.

Conclusion: Introduces the first effective continual learning approach for MIL, enabling model adaptation to shifting data distributions.

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data
arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning
models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train
models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are
ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in
single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection).
Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to
MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from
various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance
from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and
instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the
diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a
leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class
incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We
show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the
adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those
caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in rumor detection by leveraging large-scale unlabeled topic datasets and graph self-supervised learning methods to improve generalization and performance on new events.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rumors spread rapidly on social media, causing societal and economic harm. Existing methods struggle with limited labeled data and poor generalization to new events.

Method: Uses unlabeled topic datasets from Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structures. Tests three graph self-supervised methods (InfoGraph, JOAO, GraphMAE) in two training strategies. Also collects a decade-spanning rumor dataset for evaluation.

Result: General graph self-supervised methods outperform specialized rumor detection methods, showing strong performance in few-shot scenarios and better generalization.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the effectiveness of unlabeled data and self-supervised learning in improving rumor detection, especially for new and diverse topics.

Abstract: With the development of social media, rumors spread quickly, cause great harm
to society and economy. Thereby, many effective rumor detection methods have
been developed, among which the rumor propagation structure learning based
methods are particularly effective compared to other methods. However, the
existing methods still suffer from many issues including the difficulty to
obtain large-scale labeled rumor datasets, which leads to the low
generalization ability and the performance degeneration on new events since
rumors are time-critical and usually appear with hot topics or newly emergent
events. In order to solve the above problems, in this study, we used
large-scale unlabeled topic datasets crawled from the social media platform
Weibo and Twitter with claim propagation structure to improve the semantic
learning ability of a graph reprentation learing model on various topics. We
use three typical graph self-supervised methods, InfoGraph, JOAO and GraphMAE
in two commonly used training strategies, to verify the performance of general
graph semi-supervised methods in rumor detection tasks. In addition, for
alleviating the time and topic difference between unlabeled topic data and
rumor data, we also collected a rumor dataset covering a variety of topics over
a decade (10-year ago from 2022) from the Weibo rumor-refuting platform. Our
experiments show that these general graph self-supervised learning methods
outperform previous methods specifically designed for rumor detection tasks and
achieve good performance under few-shot conditions, demonstrating the better
generalization ability with the help of our massive unlabeled topic dataset.

TL;DR: ASTRA is an automated agent system designed to uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation, outperforming existing methods by 11-66% in finding vulnerabilities and improving alignment training by 17%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The safety of AI coding assistants in high-stakes domains like cybersecurity is uncertain, and current tools miss many real-world vulnerabilities.

Method: ASTRA operates in three stages: building domain-specific knowledge graphs, adaptively probing target models (spatial and temporal exploration), and generating violation-inducing cases for alignment.

Result: ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing techniques and improves alignment training effectiveness by 17%.

Conclusion: ASTRA demonstrates practical value for enhancing the safety of AI-driven code generation systems.

Abstract: AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software
development, but their safety remains deeply uncertain-especially in
high-stakes domains like cybersecurity. Current red-teaming tools often rely on
fixed benchmarks or unrealistic prompts, missing many real-world
vulnerabilities. We present ASTRA, an automated agent system designed to
systematically uncover safety flaws in AI-driven code generation and security
guidance systems. ASTRA works in three stages: (1) it builds structured
domain-specific knowledge graphs that model complex software tasks and known
weaknesses; (2) it performs online vulnerability exploration of each target
model by adaptively probing both its input space, i.e., the spatial
exploration, and its reasoning processes, i.e., the temporal exploration,
guided by the knowledge graphs; and (3) it generates high-quality
violation-inducing cases to improve model alignment. Unlike prior methods,
ASTRA focuses on realistic inputs-requests that developers might actually
ask-and uses both offline abstraction guided domain modeling and online domain
knowledge graph adaptation to surface corner-case vulnerabilities. Across two
major evaluation domains, ASTRA finds 11-66% more issues than existing
techniques and produces test cases that lead to 17% more effective alignment
training, showing its practical value for building safer AI systems.

TL;DR: The paper investigates adversarial attacks on Text-to-Image (T2I) models to bypass safety mechanisms, proposing a novel prompt learning attack framework (PLA) for black-box settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the risks of T2I models generating NSFW content and the limitations of existing adversarial attack methods in black-box settings.

Method: Proposes PLA, a gradient-based training approach tailored to black-box T2I models using multimodal similarities.

Result: PLA effectively bypasses safety mechanisms (prompt filters and post-hoc checkers) with high success rates.

Conclusion: The study highlights vulnerabilities in T2I safety mechanisms and demonstrates PLA's effectiveness in black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various
applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses
significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To
investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial
attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous
methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited
search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based
training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training
gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal
architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of
adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning
attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to
black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities.
Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety
mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety
checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: RLGS is a reinforcement learning framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting, improving rendering quality without modifying existing pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS is labor-intensive and expert-driven, leading to inconsistent results.

Method: RLGS uses lightweight policy modules to dynamically adjust hyperparameters like learning rates and densification thresholds.

Result: RLGS improves rendering quality, e.g., 0.7dB PSNR gain on TNT dataset, and works across multiple 3DGS variants.

Conclusion: RLGS offers an effective, general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive
and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and
suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning
framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy
modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates
and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly
integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We
demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS
variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness
across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For
example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT)
dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when
baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an
effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS
training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Surf3R is an end-to-end feedforward method for 3D surface reconstruction from sparse views without camera pose estimation, completing scenes in under 10 seconds. It uses multi-branch decoding, cross-view attention, and a D-Normal regularizer for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction methods require complex pre-processing like camera calibration, limiting practicality. Surf3R aims to bypass this for faster, more efficient reconstruction.

Method: Surf3R employs a multi-branch, multi-view decoding architecture with branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion. It also introduces a D-Normal regularizer for joint optimization of 3D geometry.

Result: Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets, excelling in generalization and efficiency (under 10 seconds per scene).

Conclusion: Surf3R offers a practical, efficient solution for 3D reconstruction without camera calibration, outperforming existing methods in speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera
calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive
pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this
challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that
reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and
completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a
multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference
views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed
branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the
model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring
camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an
explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples
surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D
geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica
datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.

*Ye Pan,Ruisi Zhang,Jingying Wang,Nengfu Chen,Yilin Qiu,Yu Ding,Kenny Mitchell*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to enhance performance-based animation for 3D stylized characters using blendshape techniques and machine learning, outperforming Faceware in expression quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the believability and perceptual validity of 3D stylized character animations by combining traditional blendshape techniques with machine learning.

Method: Proposes two systems: a non-real-time 3D emotion transfer network for generating rig parameters from 2D images, and a real-time blendshape adaption network for stable, consistent animations.

Result: The systems outperform Faceware in recognition, intensity, and attractiveness of expressions, with statistically higher ratings.

Conclusion: The method can be integrated into animation pipelines to create expressions more quickly and accurately.

Abstract: Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive
believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining
traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning
models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive
character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way.
For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes
use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real
time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the
character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally
stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a
commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition,
intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters
via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be
implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system
for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.

*Mhd Hussein Murtada,Z. Faidon Brotzakis,Michele Vendruscolo*

Main category: q-bio.BM

TL;DR: A deep learning framework (MD-LLM) is introduced to predict protein conformational states by leveraging LLMs, showing promise for molecular dynamics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Molecular dynamics (MD) is computationally intensive for macromolecular systems; deep learning offers a potential solution.

Method: MD-LLM-1, a fine-tuned Mistral 7B model, is applied to T4 lysozyme and Mad2 proteins to predict unseen conformational states.

Result: MD-LLM-1 successfully predicts other conformational states after training on one state, demonstrating its ability to explore protein landscapes.

Conclusion: MD-LLM-1 shows potential for learning protein dynamics but does not yet model thermodynamics and kinetics explicitly.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful approach for modelling molecular
systems, but it remains computationally intensive on spatial and time scales of
many macromolecular systems of biological interest. To explore the
opportunities offered by deep learning to address this problem, we introduce a
Molecular Dynamics Large Language Model (MD-LLM) framework to illustrate how
LLMs can be leveraged to learn protein dynamics and discover states not seen in
training. By applying MD-LLM-1, the first implementation of this approach,
obtained by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, to the T4 lysozyme and Mad2 protein
systems, we show that training on one conformational state enables the
prediction of other conformational states. These results indicate that MD-LLM-1
can learn the principles for the exploration of the conformational landscapes
of proteins, although it is not yet modeling explicitly their thermodynamics
and kinetics.

*Deming Zhou,Yuetong Fang,Zhaorui Wang,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs) to replicate primate visual cortex organization, achieving better performance and biological fidelity than traditional ANNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior deep ANNs neglect temporal dynamics, leading to performance drops and poor biological fidelity. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a solution by capturing temporal dynamics.

Method: Proposes a novel STC loss function for TDSNNs to replicate hierarchical spatial functional organization in the primate visual cortex.

Result: STC generates topographic features with minimal performance drop (no drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness.

Conclusion: TDSNNs balance computational performance and brain-like features, offering insights for neuroscience and robust deep learning models.

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where
functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely
believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have
demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic
representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This
oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like
object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,
we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture
spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We
propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic
deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the
hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual
cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our
results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features
across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically
leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture
exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1
accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the
best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in
brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates
efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in
TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs
offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like
features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science
phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep
learning models.

*Jinxing Zhou,Yanghao Zhou,Mingfei Han,Tong Wang,Xiaojun Chang,Hisham Cholakkal,Rao Muhammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: TGS-Agent introduces a Think-Ground-Segment process for Ref-AVS, improving interpretability and reducing reliance on pixel-level supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods lack interpretability and require strong supervision. TGS-Agent mimics human reasoning for better performance.

Method: Decomposes task into multimodal analysis (Ref-Thinker), grounding (Grounding-DINO), and segmentation (SAM2). Uses instruction-tuning for Ref-Thinker.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Ref-AVSBench and new R²-AVSBench.

Conclusion: TGS-Agent offers a more interpretable and effective approach for Ref-AVS.

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects
in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically
rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable
SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level
supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit
reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a
Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first
identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by
coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first
propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over
textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset
with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The
object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for
Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without
relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce
R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and
reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and
proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at

### [239] [Fast Magnetic Resonance Simulation Using Combined Update with Grouped Isochromats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03960)
*Hidenori Takeshima*

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A new MR simulation method groups isochromats to reduce computational time, achieving 3-72x speedup compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the inefficiency of simulating individual isochromats in conventional MR simulators.

Method: Group isochromats with shared properties (e.g., x-axis location, T1, T2, field inhomogeneity) to combine simulations for certain gradient types.

Result: Proposed method simulated sequences 3-72x faster (e.g., FSE: 38.1s vs. 208.4s; EPI: 7.1s vs. 66.4s).

Conclusion: Grouping isochromats significantly speeds up MR simulations without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators:
Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the
computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped
isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before
simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a
certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for
ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as
the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field
inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be
combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis
only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed
methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE)
and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed
method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the
cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD)
instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI
sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the
proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds,
respectively.

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: A computational imaging method using adaptive optics (AO) systems to enhance telescope resolution without sacrificing field of view, achieving up to 12 dB SNR improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the tradeoff between field of view and resolution in telescopes by leveraging existing AO systems.

Method: Use AO deformable mirrors to apply learned distortions for sub-pixel shifts, then jointly upsample images. End-to-end optimization accounts for telescope optics and atmospheric distortions.

Result: 12 dB SNR improvement over non-AO baselines, validated via hardware prototype and simulations.

Conclusion: The method is feasible for operational telescopes, requiring no hardware modifications.

Abstract: Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV)
and image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is
under-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational
imaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive
optics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use
the AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely
controlled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images
that exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then
be jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we
show this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO
operation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront
distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate
end-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the
upsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal
statistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our
experimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,
demonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO
super-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no
hardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a
complete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily
transferred to an operational telescope. Project webpage:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgREE is an agent-based framework for Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) that outperforms existing methods by up to 13.7% for emerging entities, requiring zero training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KGC methods struggle with emerging entities due to reliance on pretrained models or static data, lacking up-to-date information.

Method: AgREE combines iterative retrieval and multi-step reasoning to dynamically construct knowledge graph triplets without training.

Result: AgREE significantly outperforms existing methods, especially for unseen emerging entities, and introduces a new benchmark for KGC.

Conclusion: Agent-based reasoning with strategic retrieval effectively maintains up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Open-domain Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) faces significant challenges in
an ever-changing world, especially when considering the continual emergence of
new entities in daily news. Existing approaches for KGC mainly rely on
pretrained language models' parametric knowledge, pre-constructed queries, or
single-step retrieval, typically requiring substantial supervision and training
data. Even so, they often fail to capture comprehensive and up-to-date
information about unpopular and/or emerging entities. To this end, we introduce
Agentic Reasoning for Emerging Entities (AgREE), a novel agent-based framework
that combines iterative retrieval actions and multi-step reasoning to
dynamically construct rich knowledge graph triplets. Experiments show that,
despite requiring zero training efforts, AgREE significantly outperforms
existing methods in constructing knowledge graph triplets, especially for
emerging entities that were not seen during language models' training
processes, outperforming previous methods by up to 13.7%. Moreover, we propose
a new evaluation methodology that addresses a fundamental weakness of existing
setups and a new benchmark for KGC on emerging entities. Our work demonstrates
the effectiveness of combining agent-based reasoning with strategic information
retrieval for maintaining up-to-date knowledge graphs in dynamic information
environments.

*Thassilo M. Schiepanski,Nicholas Piël*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D2Snap, a DOM downsampling algorithm, matches GUI snapshot performance in web agents using GPT-4o, with higher token efficiency and improved success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents rely on GUI snapshots (e.g., screenshots) due to LLM vision limitations. DOM snapshots offer a structural alternative but face token size challenges.

Method: Proposes D2Snap, a DOM downsampling algorithm, evaluated on tasks from Online-Mind2Web using GPT-4o. Compares performance with GUI snapshots.

Result: D2Snap matches GUI snapshot baseline (67% vs. 65%) at similar token cost (1e3). Higher token configurations outperform baseline by 8%. DOM hierarchy aids LLM performance.

Conclusion: D2Snap enables efficient DOM snapshot use in web agents, matching or outperforming GUI snapshots, with DOM hierarchy benefiting LLM understanding.

Abstract: Frontier LLMs only recently enabled serviceable, autonomous web agents. At
that, a model poses as an instantaneous domain model backend. Ought to suggest
interaction, it is consulted with a web-based task and respective application
state. The key problem lies in application state serialisation
$\unicode{x2013}$ referred to as snapshot. State-of-the-art web agents are
premised on grounded GUI snapshots, i.e., screenshots enhanced with visual
cues. Not least to resemble human perception, but for images representing
relatively cheap means of model input. LLM vision still lag behind code
interpretation capabilities. DOM snapshots, which structurally resemble HTML,
impose a desired alternative. Vast model input token size, however, disables
reliable implementation with web agents to date.
  We propose D2Snap, a first-of-its-kind DOM downsampling algorithm. Based on a
GPT-4o backend, we evaluate D2Snap on tasks sampled from the Online-Mind2Web
dataset. The success rate of D2Snap-downsampled DOM snapshots (67%) matches a
grounded GUI snapshot baseline (65%) $\unicode{x2013}$ within the same input
token order of magnitude (1e3). Our best evaluated configurations
$\unicode{x2013}$ one token order above, but within the model's context window
$\unicode{x2013}$ outperform this baseline by 8%. Our evaluation, moreover,
yields that DOM-inherent hierarchy embodies a strong UI feature for LLMs.

Conclusion: Consolidates OS Agents research, guiding academic and industrial innovation, with an open-source resource.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional
J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution
of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to
reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and
mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,
Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate
tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the
fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the
environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential
capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine
methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific
foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation
protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse
tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions
for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and
self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents
research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial
development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic

TL;DR: SEAgent is a self-evolving framework for computer-use agents (CUAs) to autonomously master novel software through experiential learning, outperforming existing methods by 23.2%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CUAs rely on human-labeled data and struggle with novel or specialized software lacking annotations.

Method: SEAgent uses experiential learning, a World State Model, and a Curriculum Generator for task progression. It updates policies via adversarial imitation and GRPO, and employs a specialist-to-generalist training strategy.

Result: SEAgent improves success rates from 11.3% to 34.5% in novel software environments, outperforming UI-TARS.

Conclusion: SEAgent enables autonomous evolution of CUAs, achieving superior performance in unfamiliar software environments.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents
(CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled
data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software,
particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge,
we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to
autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software.
Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel
software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new
software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle
auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we
design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a
Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks.
The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of
adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist
training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from
specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA
capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately
achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on
their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across
five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a
significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a
competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

TL;DR: A summarization feature in BIP! Finder helps scientists quickly synthesize and understand large volumes of scientific literature by generating concise or comprehensive summaries from top-ranked search results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of synthesizing vast and conflicting scientific literature efficiently motivates the need for automated summarization tools.

Method: BIP! Finder's summarization feature dynamically leverages impact-based rankings to create context-sensitive summaries, offering both concise and detailed options.

Result: The tool accelerates literature discovery and comprehension by providing synthesized narratives tailored to user needs.

Conclusion: The summarization feature in BIP! Finder effectively addresses the bottleneck of literature review, enhancing research workflow efficiency.

Abstract: The growing volume of scientific literature makes it challenging for
scientists to move from a list of papers to a synthesized understanding of a
topic. Because of the constant influx of new papers on a daily basis, even if a
scientist identifies a promising set of papers, they still face the tedious
task of individually reading through dozens of titles and abstracts to make
sense of occasionally conflicting findings. To address this critical bottleneck
in the research workflow, we introduce a summarization feature to BIP! Finder,
a scholarly search engine that ranks literature based on distinct impact
aspects like popularity and influence. Our approach enables users to generate
two types of summaries from top-ranked search results: a concise summary for an
instantaneous at-a-glance comprehension and a more comprehensive literature
review-style summary for greater, better-organized comprehension. This ability
dynamically leverages BIP! Finder's already existing impact-based ranking and
filtering features to generate context-sensitive, synthesized narratives that
can significantly accelerate literature discovery and comprehension.

Motivation: Social media platforms are valuable for identifying estate-related issues in growing urban populations, but require efficient methods to extract actionable insights.

Method: The system uses a hierarchical classification framework to filter and categorize posts, and a transformer-based geolocation module for posts without explicit geotags.

Result: The integrated approach enables timely, data-driven insights for urban management, operational response, and situational awareness.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively leverages social media content for estate-related event detection and classification, aiding urban management.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have become deeply

TL;DR: ConvMix is a mixed-criteria framework for conversational dense retrieval, addressing data scarcity via large language models and quality control, outperforming baselines on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome data scarcity in training conversational dense retrievers and improve intent understanding from context-dependent queries.

Method: Proposes ConvMix, a framework with two-sided relevance judgment augmentation using large language models, quality control, and diverse data integration.

Result: Outperforms previous baseline methods on five benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness.

Conclusion: ConvMix effectively augments conversational dense retrieval, addressing data scarcity and improving performance.

Abstract: Conversational search aims to satisfy users' complex information needs via
multiple-turn interactions. The key challenge lies in revealing real users'
search intent from the context-dependent queries. Previous studies achieve
conversational search by fine-tuning a conversational dense retriever with
relevance judgments between pairs of context-dependent queries and documents.
However, this training paradigm encounters data scarcity issues. To this end,
we propose ConvMix, a mixed-criteria framework to augment conversational dense
retrieval, which covers more aspects than existing data augmentation
frameworks. We design a two-sided relevance judgment augmentation schema in a
scalable manner via the aid of large language models. Besides, we integrate the
framework with quality control mechanisms to obtain semantically diverse
samples and near-distribution supervisions to combine various annotated data.
Experimental results on five widely used benchmarks show that the
conversational dense retriever trained by our ConvMix framework outperforms
previous baseline methods, which demonstrates our superior effectiveness.

TL;DR: The paper explores whether multimodal recommender systems' improvements come from true understanding or model complexity, proposing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for better semantic alignment and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify if gains in multimodal recommender systems are due to genuine multimodal understanding or just increased complexity, and to improve semantic alignment in embeddings.

Method: Uses LVLMs to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via structured prompts, avoiding ad hoc fusion strategies.

Result: LVLMs improve performance and provide semantically aligned representations, which can be decoded into textual descriptions for validation.

Conclusion: LVLMs offer robust, semantically rich representations for multimodal recommender systems, enhancing performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Multimodal Recommender Systems aim to improve recommendation accuracy by
integrating heterogeneous content, such as images and textual metadata. While
effective, it remains unclear whether their gains stem from true multimodal
understanding or increased model complexity. This work investigates the role of
multimodal item embeddings, emphasizing the semantic informativeness of the
representations. Initial experiments reveal that embeddings from standard
extractors (e.g., ResNet50, Sentence-Bert) enhance performance, but rely on
modality-specific encoders and ad hoc fusion strategies that lack control over
cross-modal alignment. To overcome these limitations, we leverage Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to generate multimodal-by-design embeddings via
structured prompts. This approach yields semantically aligned representations
without requiring any fusion. Experiments across multiple settings show notable
performance improvements. Furthermore, LVLMs embeddings offer a distinctive
advantage: they can be decoded into structured textual descriptions, enabling
direct assessment of their multimodal comprehension. When such descriptions are
incorporated as side content into recommender systems, they improve
recommendation performance, empirically validating the semantic depth and
alignment encoded within LVLMs outputs. Our study highlights the importance of
semantically rich representations and positions LVLMs as a compelling
foundation for building robust and meaningful multimodal representations in
recommendation tasks.

TL;DR: QAM improves search precision by decomposing queries into metadata tags and semantic elements, outperforming traditional methods like BM25 and semantic search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of traditional search by reducing noise and enhancing relevance in free-form text queries.

Method: Hybrid framework (QAM) decomposes queries into structured metadata and semantic elements, tested on Amazon Toys Reviews dataset.

Result: Achieved 52.99% mAP@5, outperforming BM25, semantic search, cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid RRF methods.

Conclusion: QAM is a robust solution for Enterprise Search, especially in e-commerce.

Abstract: This study introduces Query Attribute Modeling (QAM), a hybrid framework that
enhances search precision and relevance by decomposing open text queries into
structured metadata tags and semantic elements. QAM addresses traditional
search limitations by automatically extracting metadata filters from free-form
text queries, reducing noise and enabling focused retrieval of relevant items.
  Experimental evaluation using the Amazon Toys Reviews dataset (10,000 unique
items with 40,000+ reviews and detailed product attributes) demonstrated QAM's
superior performance, achieving a mean average precision at 5 (mAP@5) of
52.99\%. This represents significant improvement over conventional methods,
including BM25 keyword search, encoder-based semantic similarity search,
cross-encoder re-ranking, and hybrid search combining BM25 and semantic results
via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). The results establish QAM as a robust
solution for Enterprise Search applications, particularly in e-commerce
systems.

### [251] [Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04273)
*Junan Lin,Daizong Liu,Xianke Chen,Xiaoye Qu,Xun Yang,Jixiang Zhu,Sanyuan Zhang,Jianfeng Dong*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG) for Video Moment Retrieval (VMR), dynamically integrating audio, vision, and text while mitigating noisy audio interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VMR methods neglect audio or treat all modalities equally, ignoring the varying importance of audio. Noisy audio can hinder performance, necessitating selective fusion.

Method: IMG uses a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor to weight audio and a multi-granularity fusion module for adaptive audio-vision integration. Cross-modal knowledge distillation handles missing audio during inference.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validated on the new Charades-AudioMatter dataset.

Conclusion: IMG effectively leverages audio for VMR by dynamically weighting and fusing modalities, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically
related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods
solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the
complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to
tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally
and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.
These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video
moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or
background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,
we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which
learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts
for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and
audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance
predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly
assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we
design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and
visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their
complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation
strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.
To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,
Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and
re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability
in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

*Filipe B. Teixeira,Carolina Simões,Paulo Fidalgo,Wagner Pedrosa,André Coelho,Manuel Ricardo,Luis M. Pessoa*

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-agent architecture integrating video and radio sensing for real-time control in 5G/6G networks, achieving sub-1ms delays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between telecommunications and computer vision by leveraging visual data for predicting and overcoming channel dynamics in high-frequency wireless links.

Method: A novel multi-agent architecture delivers real-time radio and video sensing to O-RAN xApps, including a new video function for blockage detection.

Result: Experimental results confirm sub-1ms delay for sensing information and successful real-time control of 5G/6G RAN using combined sensing data.

Conclusion: The architecture enables Integrated Sensing and Communications, proving effective for real-time network control.

Abstract: Telecommunications and computer vision have evolved independently. With the
emergence of high-frequency wireless links operating mostly in line-of-sight,
visual data can help predict the channel dynamics by detecting obstacles and
help overcoming them through beamforming or handover techniques.
  This paper proposes a novel architecture for delivering real-time radio and
video sensing information to O-RAN xApps through a multi-agent approach, and
introduces a new video function capable of generating blockage information for
xApps, enabling Integrated Sensing and Communications. Experimental results
show that the delay of sensing information remains under 1\,ms and that an xApp
can successfully use radio and video sensing information to control the 5G/6G
RAN in real-time.

### [254] [Position: The Current AI Conference Model is Unsustainable! Diagnosing the Crisis of Centralized AI Conference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04586)
*Nuo Chen,Moming Duan,Andre Huikai Lin,Qian Wang,Jiaying Wu,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper diagnoses structural issues in AI conferences, highlighting unsustainable growth in publications, environmental impact, negative psychological effects, and logistical challenges. It proposes the Community-Federated Conference (CFC) model as a sustainable alternative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unsustainable expansion of AI conferences, which threatens scientific dissemination, equity, and community well-being.

Method: Data-driven analysis of four key strains: scientific (rising publication rates), environmental (carbon footprint), psychological (negative sentiment and mental health concerns), and logistical (venue capacity).

Result: Identified systemic misalignment with core mission and proposed the CFC model to decentralize peer review, presentation, and networking.

Conclusion: The CFC model offers a more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient future for AI research conferences.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) conferences are essential for advancing
research, sharing knowledge, and fostering academic community. However, their
rapid expansion has rendered the centralized conference model increasingly
unsustainable. This paper offers a data-driven diagnosis of a structural crisis
that threatens the foundational goals of scientific dissemination, equity, and
community well-being. We identify four key areas of strain: (1) scientifically,
with per-author publication rates more than doubling over the past decade to
over 4.5 papers annually; (2) environmentally, with the carbon footprint of a
single conference exceeding the daily emissions of its host city; (3)
psychologically, with 71% of online community discourse reflecting negative
sentiment and 35% referencing mental health concerns; and (4) logistically,
with attendance at top conferences such as NeurIPS 2024 beginning to outpace
venue capacity. These pressures point to a system that is misaligned with its
core mission. In response, we propose the Community-Federated Conference (CFC)
model, which separates peer review, presentation, and networking into globally
coordinated but locally organized components, offering a more sustainable,
inclusive, and resilient path forward for AI research.

### [255] [Multilingual Source Tracing of Speech Deepfakes: A First Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04143)
*Xi Xuan,Yang Xiao,Rohan Kumar Das,Tomi Kinnunen*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: The paper introduces a benchmark for tracing the source models of multilingual deepfake speech, addressing gaps in current research focused on detection rather than tracing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of generative AI enables easy creation of deepfake speech, raising concerns about misuse. Current research lacks focus on tracing the source models of such speech.

Method: The study develops a benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing, comparing DSP- and SSL-based modeling, and evaluates cross-lingual generalization.

Result: Findings provide insights into identifying speech generation models, especially when training and inference languages differ.

Conclusion: The work offers a foundation for future research in multilingual deepfake source tracing, with available dataset, protocol, and code.

Abstract: Recent progress in generative AI has made it increasingly easy to create
natural-sounding deepfake speech from just a few seconds of audio. While these
tools support helpful applications, they also raise serious concerns by making
it possible to generate convincing fake speech in many languages. Current
research has largely focused on detecting fake speech, but little attention has
been given to tracing the source models used to generate it. This paper
introduces the first benchmark for multilingual speech deepfake source tracing,
covering both mono- and cross-lingual scenarios. We comparatively investigate
DSP- and SSL-based modeling; examine how SSL representations fine-tuned on
different languages impact cross-lingual generalization performance; and
evaluate generalization to unseen languages and speakers. Our findings offer
the first comprehensive insights into the challenges of identifying speech
generation models when training and inference languages differ. The dataset,
protocol and code are available at
https://github.com/xuanxixi/Multilingual-Source-Tracing.
