This paper introduces a\nsimple yet effective intervention: augmenting visual inputs with low-level\nspatial structures (e.g., horizontal lines) and pairing this with a textual\nprompt that encourages sequential, spatially-aware parsing. We empirically\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements across core visual reasoning\ntasks. Specifically, our method improves GPT-4o visual search accuracy by\n25.00%, increases counting accuracy by 26.83%, reduces edit distance error in\nscene description by 0.32, and enhances performance on spatial relationship\ntasks by 9.50% on a a 2D synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we find that the\nvisual modification is essential for these gains; purely textual strategies,\nincluding Chain-of-Thought prompting, are insufficient and can even degrade\nperformance. Our method enhances binding only with a single-query inference,\nunderscoring the importance of visual input design over purely\nlinguistically-based approaches.

In real-world applications, however, users\noften seek tools to faithfully realize their creative editing intentions with\nprecise and consistent control.

In this work, we present Shape-for-Motion, a novel\nframework that incorporates a 3D proxy for precise and consistent video\nediting. Shape-for-Motion achieves this by converting the target object in the\ninput video to a time-consistent mesh, i.e., a 3D proxy, allowing edits to be\nperformed directly on the proxy and then inferred back to the video frames. To\nsimplify the editing process, we design a novel Dual-Propagation Strategy that\nallows users to perform edits on the 3D mesh of a single frame, and the edits\nare then automatically propagated to the 3D meshes of the other frames. The 3D\nmeshes for different frames are further projected onto the 2D space to produce\nthe edited geometry and texture renderings, which serve as inputs to a\ndecoupled video diffusion model for generating edited results. Our framework\nsupports various precise and physically-consistent manipulations across the\nvideo frames, including pose editing, rotation, scaling, translation, texture\nmodification, and object composition.

To evaluate the ability of AI agents to\nreproduce results in an active research area, we introduce the Automated LLM\nSpeedrunning Benchmark, leveraging the research community contributions on the\nNanoGPT speedrun, a competition to train a GPT-2 model in the shortest time.\nEach of the 19 speedrun tasks provides the agent with the previous records\ntraining script, optionally paired with one of three hint formats, ranging from\npseudocode to paper-like descriptions of the new records improvements. Records\nexecute quickly by design and speedrun improvements encompass diverse\ncode-level changes, ranging from high-level algorithmic advancements to\nhardware-aware optimizations. These features make the benchmark both accessible\nand realistic for the frontier problem of improving LLM training. We find that\nrecent reasoning LLMs combined with SoTA scaffolds struggle to reimplement\nalready-known innovations in our benchmark, even when given detailed hints. Our\nbenchmark thus provides a simple, non-saturated measure of an LLMs ability to\nautomate scientific reproduction, a necessary (but not sufficient) skill for an\nautonomous research agent.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces the Automated LLM Speedrunning Benchmark to evaluate AI agents' ability to reproduce scientific results, using the NanoGPT speedrun as a case study.
