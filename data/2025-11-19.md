### [1] [Signature vs. Substance: Evaluating the Balance of Adversarial Resistance and Linguistic Quality in Watermarking Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13722)
*William Guo,Adaku Uchendu,Ana Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Watermarking techniques for LLM-generated text face challenges: they degrade text quality, can be removed by adversarial attacks, and alter writing style, making adoption difficult.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address potential harms of LLM-generated text by evaluating watermarking techniques' robustness against attacks and their ability to preserve text quality and writing style.

Method: Evaluated multiple watermarking techniques using paraphrasing and back translation attacks, and analyzed text quality and writing style preservation using linguistic metrics.

Result: Watermarking techniques preserve semantics but alter writing style and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly back translation.

Conclusion: Current watermarking methods need improvement in robustness and writing style preservation to encourage wider adoption by LLM creators.

Abstract: To mitigate the potential harms of Large Language Models (LLMs)generated text, researchers have proposed watermarking, a process of embedding detectable signals within text. With watermarking, we can always accurately detect LLM-generated texts. However, recent findings suggest that these techniques often negatively affect the quality of the generated texts, and adversarial attacks can strip the watermarking signals, causing the texts to possibly evade detection. These findings have created resistance in the wide adoption of watermarking by LLM creators. Finally, to encourage adoption, we evaluate the robustness of several watermarking techniques to adversarial attacks by comparing paraphrasing and back translation (i.e., English $\to$ another language $\to$ English) attacks; and their ability to preserve quality and writing style of the unwatermarked texts by using linguistic metrics to capture quality and writing style of texts. Our results suggest that these watermarking techniques preserve semantics, deviate from the writing style of the unwatermarked texts, and are susceptible to adversarial attacks, especially for the back translation attack.

### [3] [Can QE-informed (Re)Translation lead to Error Correction?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13884)
*Govardhan Padmanabhan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two training-free approaches for QE-informed error correction: one selects best translation from multiple LLM candidates, the other uses QE explanations to replace error substrings with minimal edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APE systems tend to overcorrect MT outputs, degrading performance. The paper explores training-free alternatives to avoid this issue.

Method: Approach 1: QE-informed Retranslation - selects highest-quality translation from multiple LLM candidates. Approach 2: Uses QE explanations to replace error substrings with conditional heuristic to minimize edits.

Result: First approach achieved Delta COMET score of 0.0201 (winning position), second approach scored -0.0108.

Conclusion: Training-free QE-informed retranslation approach outperforms APE-like methods and won the WMT 2025 task.

Abstract: The paper presents two approaches submitted to the WMT 2025 Automated Translation Quality Evaluation Systems Task 3 - Quality Estimation (QE)-informed Segment-level Error Correction. While jointly training QE systems with Automatic Post-Editing (APE) has shown improved performance for both tasks, APE systems are still known to overcorrect the output of Machine Translation (MT), leading to a degradation in performance. We investigate a simple training-free approach - QE-informed Retranslation, and compare it with another within the same training-free paradigm. Our winning approach selects the highest-quality translation from multiple candidates generated by different LLMs. The second approach, more akin to APE, instructs an LLM to replace error substrings as specified in the provided QE explanation(s). A conditional heuristic was employed to minimise the number of edits, with the aim of maximising the Gain-to-Edit ratio. The two proposed approaches achieved a Delta COMET score of 0.0201 and -0.0108, respectively, leading the first approach to achieve the winning position on the subtask leaderboard.

### [4] [What Works for 'Lost-in-the-Middle' in LLMs? A Study on GM-Extract and Mitigations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13900)
*Mihir Gupte,Eshan Dixit,Muhammad Tayyab,Arun Adiththan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces GM-Extract benchmark to study LLMs' "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon in retrieval tasks, evaluates 7-8B parameter models on multi-document tasks, and analyzes mitigation methods with nuanced effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon where LLMs struggle with long-range context in retrieval applications, particularly for control variable extraction in real-world settings.

Method: Proposed GM-Extract benchmark with two evaluation metrics (Document Metric for spatial retrieval, Variable Extraction Metric for semantic retrieval), systematically evaluated 7-8B parameter models on multi-document tasks, and analyzed categorized mitigation methods (black-box and white-box).

Result: Found significant performance changes based on data representation in context window, clear performance patterns across models correlated with perplexity scores, and nuanced effectiveness of mitigation methods - some improved performance while others had negative impact.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive understanding of mitigation strategies' utility in practical contexts, highlighting that their efficacy is highly dependent on specific scenarios and data representation approaches.

Abstract: The diminishing ability of large language models (LLMs) to effectively utilize long-range context-the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon-poses a significant challenge in retrieval-based LLM applications. To study the impact of this phenomenon in a real-world application setting, we introduce GM-Extract, a novel benchmark dataset meticulously designed to evaluate LLM performance on retrieval of control variables. To accurately diagnose failure modes, we propose a simple yet elegant evaluation system using two distinct metrics: one for spatial retrieval capability (Document Metric) and the other for semantic retrieval capability (Variable Extraction Metric). We conduct a systematic evaluation of 7-8B parameter models on two multi-document tasks (key-value extraction and question-answering), demonstrating a significant change in retrieval performance simply by altering how the data is represented in the context window. While a distinct U-shaped curve was not consistently observed, our analysis reveals a clear pattern of performance across models, which we further correlate with perplexity scores. Furthermore, we perform a literature survey of mitigation methods, which we categorize into two distinct approaches: black-box and white-box methods. We then apply these techniques to our benchmark, finding that their efficacy is highly nuanced. Our evaluation highlights scenarios where these strategies successfully improve performance, as well as surprising cases where they lead to a negative impact, providing a comprehensive understanding of their utility in a practical context.

### [5] [Hint-Augmented Re-ranking: Efficient Product Search using LLM-Based Query Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13994)
*Yilun Zhu,Nikhita Vedula,Shervin Malmasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can interpret superlative queries in e-commerce by extracting structured hints about user intent, improving search performance significantly while addressing latency issues through model transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Search queries with superlatives require complex multi-dimensional comparisons that need both linguistic understanding and domain knowledge, which current systems struggle with.

Method: A framework that uses LLMs to decompose superlative queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, then transfers these interpretations to lightweight models for efficient deployment.

Result: Improves search performance by 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines, while solving latency issues of direct LLM-based reranking.

Conclusion: Superlative semantics can be effectively represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while meeting practical deployment constraints.

Abstract: Search queries with superlatives (e.g., best, most popular) require comparing candidates across multiple dimensions, demanding linguistic understanding and domain knowledge. We show that LLMs can uncover latent intent behind these expressions in e-commerce queries through a framework that extracts structured interpretations or hints. Our approach decomposes queries into attribute-value hints generated concurrently with retrieval, enabling efficient integration into the ranking pipeline. Our method improves search performanc eby 10.9 points in MAP and ranking by 5.9 points in MRR over baselines. Since direct LLM-based reranking faces prohibitive latency, we develop an efficient approach transferring superlative interpretations to lightweight models. Our findings provide insights into how superlative semantics can be represented and transferred between models, advancing linguistic interpretation in retrieval systems while addressing practical deployment constraints.

*Chenchen Kuai,Zihao Li,Braden Rosen,Stephanie Paan,Navid Jafari,Jean-Louis Briaud,Yunlong Zhang,Youssef M. A. Hashash,Yang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoRA-RAG is a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms unstructured post-disaster reconnaissance reports into structured knowledge for multi-hazard reasoning, achieving 94.5% accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, but their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. LLMs often generate unreliable outputs when domain grounding is absent.

Method: Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG) integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases, uses agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence, and includes a verification loop for evidence assessment and query refinement.

Result: MoRA-RAG achieves 94.5% accuracy on HazardRecQA dataset, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30% and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10%, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. It enables open-weight LLMs to match proprietary model performance.

Conclusion: MoRA-RAG establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

Abstract: Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.

### [7] [HiEAG: Evidence-Augmented Generation for Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14027)
*Junjie Wu,Yumeng Fu,Nan Yu,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiEAG is a hierarchical framework that enhances multimodal out-of-context misinformation detection by incorporating external evidence consistency through reranking and rewriting modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOC misinformation detection methods focus mainly on internal consistency between image-text pairs but overlook the importance of external consistency with external evidence, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes HiEAG framework with evidence reranking using Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) and evidence rewriting using Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP), integrated with multimodal large language models for comprehensive external consistency checking.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets show HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy across all samples.

Conclusion: The hierarchical evidence-augmented generation framework effectively addresses external consistency checking in multimodal misinformation detection and demonstrates superior performance through comprehensive evidence processing.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal out-of-context (OOC) misinformation detection have made remarkable progress in checking the consistencies between different modalities for supporting or refuting image-text pairs. However, existing OOC misinformation detection methods tend to emphasize the role of internal consistency, ignoring the significant of external consistency between image-text pairs and external evidence. In this paper, we propose HiEAG, a novel Hierarchical Evidence-Augmented Generation framework to refine external consistency checking through leveraging the extensive knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our approach decomposes external consistency checking into a comprehensive engine pipeline, which integrates reranking and rewriting, apart from retrieval. Evidence reranking module utilizes Automatic Evidence Selection Prompting (AESP) that acquires the relevant evidence item from the products of evidence retrieval. Subsequently, evidence rewriting module leverages Automatic Evidence Generation Prompting (AEGP) to improve task adaptation on MLLM-based OOC misinformation detectors. Furthermore, our approach enables explanation for judgment, and achieves impressive performance with instruction tuning. Experimental results on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiEAG surpasses previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the accuracy over all samples.

*Zijin Su,Huanzhu Lv,Yuren Niu,Yiming Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Created a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset and developed an enhanced classification model that outperforms models trained on imbalanced data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-label sentiment datasets like GoEmotions suffer from severe class imbalance, which negatively impacts model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions.

Method: Constructed balanced dataset by integrating GoEmotions, Sentiment140 samples labeled with RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions, and GPT-4 mini generated texts. Built classification model combining FastText embeddings, CNN layers, bidirectional LSTM, attention mechanism, and sigmoid output layer with mixed precision training.

Result: Significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data.

Conclusion: The balanced dataset and enhanced classification approach effectively address class imbalance issues in multi-label sentiment classification.

Abstract: Multi-label sentiment classification plays a vital role in natural language processing by detecting multiple emotions within a single text. However, existing datasets like GoEmotions often suffer from severe class imbalance, which hampers model performance, especially for underrepresented emotions. To address this, we constructed a balanced multi-label sentiment dataset by integrating the original GoEmotions data, emotion-labeled samples from Sentiment140 using a RoBERTa-base-GoEmotions model, and manually annotated texts generated by GPT-4 mini. Our data balancing strategy ensured an even distribution across 28 emotion categories. Based on this dataset, we developed an enhanced multi-label classification model that combines pre-trained FastText embeddings, convolutional layers for local feature extraction, bidirectional LSTM for contextual learning, and an attention mechanism to highlight sentiment-relevant words. A sigmoid-activated output layer enables multi-label prediction, and mixed precision training improves computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC compared to models trained on imbalanced data, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

*Le Yu,Zhengyue Zhao,Yawen Zheng,Yunhao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Stealth Fine-Tuning is a novel attack method that bypasses safety alignment in Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models by using segment-level interference to generate harmful reasoning traces and reusing them as supervised fine-tuning data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RVLMs rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, but their exposed chain-of-thought traces create new attack surfaces that can be exploited.

Method: Uses segment-level interference to elicit harmful reasoning traces, reuses self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data, and employs turn-based weighted loss design for lightweight, distribution-consistent fine-tuning.

Result: With only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability and maintaining original representation distribution.

Conclusion: Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective method to bypass alignment defenses in RVLMs, demonstrating significant vulnerability in current safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented Vision-Language Models (RVLMs) rely on safety alignment to prevent harmful behavior, yet their exposed chain-of-thought (CoT) traces introduce new attack surfaces. In this work, we find that the safety alignment of RVLMs can be easily break through a novel attack method termed \textbf{Stealth Fine-Tuning}. Our method elicits harmful reasoning traces through \textbf{segment-level interference} and reuses the self-generated outputs as supervised fine-tuning data. Through a \textbf{turn-based weighted} loss design, yielding a lightweight, distribution-consistent finetuning method. In our experiment, with only 499 samples and under 3 hours on a single A100 (QLoRA), Stealth Fine-Tuning outperforms IDEATOR by 38.52\% ASR while preserving general reasoning ability, as the tuned model retains the original representation distribution. Experiments on AdvBench and several general benchmarks demonstrate that Stealth Fine-Tuning is a low-cost and highly effective way to bypass alignment defenses. \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Disclaimer: This paper contains content that may be disturbing or offensive.}}

### [10] [Synthetic Clinical Notes for Rare ICD Codes: A Data-Centric Framework for Long-Tail Medical Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14112)
*Truong Vo,Weiyi Wu,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a data-centric framework using synthetic discharge summaries to address long-tail distribution issues in ICD coding, improving rare code prediction while maintaining overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic ICD coding suffers from extreme long-tail distribution where thousands of rare and zero-shot codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores.

Method: Generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries by constructing realistic multi-label code sets using real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Creates 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes.

Result: Fine-tuning PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD models on extended datasets shows modest macro-F1 improvement while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction, demonstrating the value of data-centric approaches for addressing imbalance in medical NLP tasks.

Abstract: Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.

### [11] [From Graphs to Hypergraphs: Enhancing Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Multi-Level Relational Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14142)
*Omkar Mahesh Kashyap,Padegal Amit,Madhav Kashyap,Ashwini M Joshi,Shylaja SS*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HyperABSA introduces a dynamic hypergraph framework for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis that uses hierarchical clustering to create sample-specific aspect-opinion structures, overcoming limitations of pairwise graph approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based ABSA methods only model pairwise dependencies, requiring multiple graphs for different relational views which introduces redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation, especially problematic in short-text and low-resource settings.

Method: Proposes HyperABSA with dynamic hypergraph construction using sample-specific hierarchical clustering. Introduces an acceleration-fallback cutoff mechanism to adaptively determine clustering granularity for hyperedge formation.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones.

Conclusion: Dynamic hypergraph construction is an efficient and powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) predicts sentiment polarity for specific aspect terms, a task made difficult by conflicting sentiments across aspects and the sparse context of short texts. Prior graph-based approaches model only pairwise dependencies, forcing them to construct multiple graphs for different relational views. These introduce redundancy, parameter overhead, and error propagation during fusion, limiting robustness in short-text, low-resource settings. We present HyperABSA, a dynamic hypergraph framework that induces aspect-opinion structures through sample-specific hierarchical clustering. To construct these hyperedges, we introduce a novel acceleration-fallback cutoff for hierarchical clustering, which adaptively determines the level of granularity. Experiments on three benchmarks (Lap14, Rest14, MAMS) show consistent improvements over strong graph baselines, with substantial gains when paired with RoBERTa backbones. These results position dynamic hypergraph construction as an efficient, powerful alternative for ABSA, with potential extensions to other short-text NLP tasks.

### [12] [Applying Relation Extraction and Graph Matching to Answering Multiple Choice Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14144)
*Naoki Shimoda,Akihiro Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method that combines Transformer-based relation extraction with knowledge graph matching to answer multiple-choice questions while maintaining traceability of the reasoning process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage dynamically generated knowledge graphs from natural language texts for answering questions, while addressing the issue that relation extraction methods can generate false information from factually incorrect texts.

Method: The method converts question sentences into relational graphs using relation extraction, then verifies them against factually correct knowledge graphs under the closed-world assumption to measure truthfulness.

Result: The method achieves up to around 70% accuracy in answering multiple-choice questions while providing traceable output procedures, with question category significantly influencing accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully combines dynamic knowledge graph generation with verification to answer questions with traceable reasoning, though performance varies by question type.

Abstract: In this research, we combine Transformer-based relation extraction with matching of knowledge graphs (KGs) and apply them to answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) while maintaining the traceability of the output process. KGs are structured representations of factual knowledge consisting of entities and relations. Due to the high construction cost, they had been regarded as static databases with validated links. However, the recent development of Transformer-based relation extraction (RE) methods has enabled us to generate KGs dynamically by giving them natural language texts, and thereby opened the possibility for representing the meaning of the input sentences with the created KGs. Using this effect, we propose a method that answers MCQs in the "fill-in-the-blank" format, taking care of the point that RE methods generate KGs that represent false information if provided with factually incorrect texts. We measure the truthfulness of each question sentence by (i) converting the sentence into a relational graph using an RE method and (ii) verifying it against factually correct KGs under the closed-world assumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our method correctly answers up to around 70% of the questions, while providing traceability of the procedure. We also highlight that the question category has a vast influence on the accuracy.

### [13] [Selective Weak-to-Strong Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14166)
*Hao Lang,Fei Huang,Yongbin Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes selective weak-to-strong generalization framework that avoids unnecessary weak supervision by using a classifier to identify questions strong models can answer themselves, improving alignment robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses limitations in weak-to-strong generalization methods where invariable use of weak supervision can be harmful, especially for future superhuman models that will surpass human capabilities.

Method: Trains binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions strong models can answer, uses self-generated labels for alignment, and refines weak labels with graph smoothing.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show consistent outperformance over competitive baselines, with P(IK) generalizing across tasks and difficulties.

Conclusion: Selective weak-to-strong generalization can help superalignment by avoiding harmful weak supervision and leveraging strong model capabilities.

Abstract: Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.

### [14] [SymLoc: Symbolic Localization of Hallucination across HaluEval and TruthfulQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14172)
*Naveen Lamba,Sanju Tiwari,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes the first symbolic localization framework that traces hallucination development across LLM layers using symbolic linguistic knowledge, revealing that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic processing failure starting in early layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with hallucination triggered by symbolic elements like modifiers, negation, and named entities, but current localization methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role of symbolic linguistic knowledge in triggering hallucinations.

Method: Proposed a symbolic localization framework leveraging symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to trace hallucination development across all model layers, analyzing five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA with focus on symbolic triggers.

Result: Attention variance for symbolic linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels. Despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants) with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers in deeper layers.

Conclusion: Hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, and symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

Abstract: LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.

### [15] [Harnessing Deep LLM Participation for Robust Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14181)
*Jiajun Hou,Chenyu Zhang,Rui Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepEL is a comprehensive framework that integrates LLMs throughout all stages of entity linking, featuring a novel self-validation mechanism that uses global context to improve entity disambiguation and relationship recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use LLMs only in isolated stages of entity linking, failing to fully leverage their capabilities across the entire process. Additionally, disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance.

Method: DeepEL incorporates LLMs into every stage of entity linking and introduces a self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information to enable LLMs to correct their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities.

Result: DeepEL substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods across ten benchmark datasets, achieving an average 2.6% improvement in overall F1 score and a 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: Deep integration of LLMs throughout the entity linking process, combined with self-validation using global context, effectively advances the state-of-the-art in entity linking performance.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL), the task of mapping textual entity mentions to their corresponding entries in knowledge bases, constitutes a fundamental component of natural language understanding. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential for enhancing EL performance. Prior research has leveraged LLMs to improve entity disambiguation and input representation, yielding significant gains in accuracy and robustness. However, these approaches typically apply LLMs to isolated stages of the EL task, failing to fully integrate their capabilities throughout the entire process.
  In this work, we introduce DeepEL, a comprehensive framework that incorporates LLMs into every stage of the entity linking task. Furthermore, we identify that disambiguating entities in isolation is insufficient for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-validation mechanism that utilizes global contextual information, enabling LLMs to rectify their own predictions and better recognize cohesive relationships among entities within the same sentence.
  Extensive empirical evaluation across ten benchmark datasets demonstrates that DeepEL substantially outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 2.6\% in overall F1 score and a remarkable 4% gain on out-of-domain datasets. These results underscore the efficacy of deep LLM integration in advancing the state-of-the-art in entity linking.

### [16] [ArbESC+: Arabic Enhanced Edit Selection System Combination for Grammatical Error Correction Resolving conflict and improving system combination in Arabic GEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14230)
*Ahlam Alrehili,Areej Alhothali*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArbESC+ is a multi-system approach for Arabic grammatical error correction that combines multiple models to generate correction proposals, using a classifier to select and implement appropriate corrections with support techniques for filtering and reliability estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arabic has complex morphological and syntactic structure, making GEC more challenging than other languages. Previous approaches used individual models without leveraging the benefits of combining different systems.

Method: Combines multiple models (AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems) to generate correction proposals represented as numerical features. Uses a classifier to determine appropriate corrections with support techniques for filtering overlapping corrections and estimating decision reliability.

Result: Achieved F0.5 scores of 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data, outperforming single model approaches.

Conclusion: This is the first Arabic attempt to integrate linguistic error correction through multi-system combination, providing a practical advancement for Arabic text processing tools that benefits users and researchers.

Abstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.

### [17] [MuCPT: Music-related Natural Language Model Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14245)
*Kai Tian,Yirong Mao,Wendong Bi,Hanjie Wang,Que Wenhui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a framework for building domain-specific LLMs for music by creating a large music-related corpus (40B tokens) with domain-first data processing, RM-based quality control, and a new MusicSimpleQA benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform well on general tasks but struggle in specialized domains like music due to limitations in corpus scale, purity, and data-task alignment.

Method: Constructed a large music corpus using domain-first data pipeline with filtering, cleaning, and privacy masking. Introduced reference-model based token-level soft scoring for quality control and dynamic down-weighting during optimization. Developed MusicSimpleQA benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Created a scalable data-training framework that reduces noise gradients and amplifies task-aligned signals, enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment.

Conclusion: The work advances both corpus construction and training objectives, providing a reusable framework and evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in music.

Abstract: Large language models perform strongly on general tasks but remain constrained in specialized settings such as music, particularly in the music-entertainment domain, where corpus scale, purity, and the match between data and training objectives are critical. We address this by constructing a large, music-related natural language corpus (40B tokens) that combines open source and in-house data, and by implementing a domain-first data pipeline: a lightweight classifier filters and weights in-domain text, followed by multi-stage cleaning, de-duplication, and privacy-preserving masking. We further integrate multi-source music text with associated metadata to form a broader, better-structured foundation of domain knowledge. On the training side, we introduce reference-model (RM)-based token-level soft scoring for quality control: a unified loss-ratio criterion is used both for data selection and for dynamic down-weighting during optimization, reducing noise gradients and amplifying task-aligned signals, thereby enabling more effective music-domain continued pretraining and alignment. To assess factuality, we design the MusicSimpleQA benchmark, which adopts short, single-answer prompts with automated agreement scoring. Beyond the benchmark design, we conduct systematic comparisons along the axes of data composition. Overall, this work advances both the right corpus and the right objective, offering a scalable data-training framework and a reusable evaluation tool for building domain LLMs in the music field.

### [18] [Towards Authentic Movie Dubbing with Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14249)
*Rui Liu,Yuan Zhao,Zhenqi Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Authentic-Dubber is a novel movie dubbing system that simulates real director-actor collaboration using multimodal reference footage, emotion-based retrieval, and progressive speech generation to improve emotional expressiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dubbing approaches overlook the critical director-actor interaction in authentic workflows, where directors guide actors to internalize emotional context before performance.

Method: Proposes Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning with three mechanisms: multimodal Reference Footage library with LLM comprehension, Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation, and Progressive Graph-based speech generation.

Result: Achieves comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness, validated by subjective and objective evaluations on V2C Animation benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: Authentic-Dubber successfully replicates authentic dubbing workflow and demonstrates effectiveness in emotional dubbing performance.

Abstract: The automatic movie dubbing model generates vivid speech from given scripts, replicating a speaker's timbre from a brief timbre prompt while ensuring lip-sync with the silent video. Existing approaches simulate a simplified workflow where actors dub directly without preparation, overlooking the critical director-actor interaction. In contrast, authentic workflows involve a dynamic collaboration: directors actively engage with actors, guiding them to internalize the context cues, specifically emotion, before performance. To address this issue, we propose a new Retrieve-Augmented Director-Actor Interaction Learning scheme to achieve authentic movie dubbing, termed Authentic-Dubber, which contains three novel mechanisms: (1) We construct a multimodal Reference Footage library to simulate the learning footage provided by directors. Note that we integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve deep comprehension of emotional representations across multimodal signals. (2) To emulate how actors efficiently and comprehensively internalize director-provided footage during dubbing, we propose an Emotion-Similarity-based Retrieval-Augmentation strategy. This strategy retrieves the most relevant multimodal information that aligns with the target silent video. (3) We develop a Progressive Graph-based speech generation approach that incrementally incorporates the retrieved multimodal emotional knowledge, thereby simulating the actor's final dubbing process. The above mechanisms enable the Authentic-Dubber to faithfully replicate the authentic dubbing workflow, achieving comprehensive improvements in emotional expressiveness. Both subjective and objective evaluations on the V2C Animation benchmark dataset validate the effectiveness. The code and demos are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/Authentic-Dubber.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AfriSpeech-MultiBench is the first domain-specific evaluation suite for African English accents across 10+ countries and 7 application domains, benchmarking various ASR and multimodal LLM systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite growing interest in voice interfaces globally, there's no publicly available application-specific model evaluation catering to Africa's linguistic diversity, creating a gap for inclusive voice applications.

Method: Created a comprehensive evaluation suite covering 100+ African English accents across 10+ countries and 7 domains (Finance, Legal, Medical, etc.), benchmarking open/closed ASR models and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition using spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech from African datasets.

Result: Open-source ASR models excel in spontaneous speech but degrade on noisy dialogue; multimodal LLMs are accent-robust but struggle with domain-specific entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary by country/domain; African English fine-tuned models achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency; hallucinations remain problematic for most SOTA models.

Conclusion: The benchmark empowers practitioners and researchers to select appropriate voice technologies for African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled AI, including Google's NotebookLM and OpenAI's speech-to-speech API, are driving widespread interest in voice interfaces globally. Despite this momentum, there exists no publicly available application-specific model evaluation that caters to Africa's linguistic diversity. We present AfriSpeech-MultiBench, the first domain-specific evaluation suite for over 100 African English accents across 10+ countries and seven application domains: Finance, Legal, Medical, General dialogue, Call Center, Named Entities and Hallucination Robustness. We benchmark a diverse range of open, closed, unimodal ASR and multimodal LLM-based speech recognition systems using both spontaneous and non-spontaneous speech conversation drawn from various open African accented English speech datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals systematic variation: open-source ASR models excels in spontaneous speech contexts but degrades on noisy, non-native dialogue; multimodal LLMs are more accent-robust yet struggle with domain-specific named entities; proprietary models deliver high accuracy on clean speech but vary significantly by country and domain. Models fine-tuned on African English achieve competitive accuracy with lower latency, a practical advantage for deployment, hallucinations still remain a big problem for most SOTA models. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark, we empower practitioners and researchers to select voice technologies suited to African use-cases, fostering inclusive voice applications for underserved communities.

### [20] [Entropy-Guided Reasoning Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14258)
*Hourun Zhu,Yang Gao,Wenlong Fei,Jiawei Li,Huashan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes an entropy-guided training framework to compress chain-of-thought reasoning length by 80% while maintaining or improving accuracy, addressing the entropy conflict problem in existing compression methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models have excessive chain-of-thought output length causing high computation costs and poor deployability. Existing compression methods overlook the entropy conflict phenomenon where compression training decreases entropy (shortening reasoning) while accuracy objectives increase entropy (lengthening reasoning), creating a local dilemma.

Method: An entropy-guided training framework that guides the model toward efficient reasoning when entropy decreases (encouraging concise thought steps) and reinforces exploration when entropy rises (improving robustness under compact reasoning mode).

Result: Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show compression of reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or surpassing baseline accuracy.

Conclusion: The entropy-guided approach effectively resolves the entropy conflict in reasoning compression, achieving significant length reduction without sacrificing performance, with code and models to be released publicly.

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks, yet the excessive length of their chain-of-thought outputs remains a major practical bottleneck due to high computation cost and poor deployability. Existing compression methods have achieved partial success but overlook a crucial phenomenon in the training process -- the entropy conflict. During compression training, entropy decreases, leading to shorter reasoning but limited exploration, while accuracy-oriented objectives increase entropy, lengthening reasoning chains. This can cause the model to get stuck in a local dilemma. Our analysis further reveals the origin of the entropy conflict: many high-entropy tokens are logical connectors that receive larger gradients and are encouraged under the performance objective, while the compression objective simultaneously penalizes these potentially redundant connectors. This opposing pressure creates a direct source of entropy conflict. To address these issues, we adopt an entropy-guided training framework. As entropy descends, the model is guided toward efficient reasoning by encouraging concise thought steps; as entropy rises, exploration is reinforced under the compact reasoning mode to improve robustness. Experiments on six mathematical benchmarks show that our method compresses reasoning length to 20% of the original while maintaining or even surpassing baseline accuracy. Code and models will be released publicly.

### [21] [Don't Miss the Forest for the Trees: In-Depth Confidence Estimation for LLMs via Reasoning over the Answer Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14275)
*Ante Wang,Weizhi Ma,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using verbalized probability distributions instead of single confidence scores to improve LLM reliability estimation through deeper reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for estimating LLM confidence rely on verbalized confidence scores combined with chain-of-thought reasoning, but how different reasoning strategies affect confidence estimation remains under-explored.

Method: The method involves having LLMs predict verbalized probability distributions over the answer space, which encourages deeper reasoning by requiring consideration of all possible candidates and careful confidence score assignment.

Result: The approach shows advantages across different models and tasks, works regardless of whether the answer space is known, maintains effectiveness after reinforcement learning, and produces reasoning patterns aligned with human expectations.

Conclusion: Predicting verbalized probability distributions effectively enhances confidence estimation by promoting more thorough reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Knowing the reliability of a model's response is essential in application. With the strong generation capabilities of LLMs, research has focused on generating verbalized confidence. This is further enhanced by combining chain-of-thought reasoning, which provides logical and transparent estimation. However, how reasoning strategies affect the estimated confidence is still under-explored. In this work, we demonstrate that predicting a verbalized probability distribution can effectively encourage in-depth reasoning for confidence estimation. Intuitively, it requires an LLM to consider all candidates within the answer space instead of basing on a single guess, and to carefully assign confidence scores to meet the requirements of a distribution. This method shows an advantage across different models and various tasks, regardless of whether the answer space is known. Its advantage is maintained even after reinforcement learning, and further analysis shows its reasoning patterns are aligned with human expectations.

TL;DR: AraLingBench is a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating Arabic linguistic competence in LLMs through 150 multiple-choice questions across grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery in Arabic LLMs, as current models often succeed through memorization rather than authentic comprehension.

Method: Created a benchmark with 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions spanning five linguistic categories, then evaluated 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs on their structural language understanding.

Result: Current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning, revealing a persistent gap between knowledge-based performance and true linguistic mastery.

Conclusion: AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs by isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, highlighting the need for models that achieve authentic comprehension rather than just pattern recognition.

Abstract: We present AraLingBench: a fully human annotated benchmark for evaluating the Arabic linguistic competence of large language models (LLMs). The benchmark spans five core categories: grammar, morphology, spelling, reading comprehension, and syntax, through 150 expert-designed multiple choice questions that directly assess structural language understanding. Evaluating 35 Arabic and bilingual LLMs reveals that current models demonstrate strong surface level proficiency but struggle with deeper grammatical and syntactic reasoning. AraLingBench highlights a persistent gap between high scores on knowledge-based benchmarks and true linguistic mastery, showing that many models succeed through memorization or pattern recognition rather than authentic comprehension. By isolating and measuring fundamental linguistic skills, AraLingBench provides a diagnostic framework for developing Arabic LLMs. The full evaluation code is publicly available on GitHub.

*Xingwei He,Qianru Zhang,Pengfei Chen,Guanhua Chen,Linlin Yu,Yuan Yuan,Siu-Ming Yiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConInstruct benchmark reveals LLMs can detect instruction conflicts but rarely notify users or request clarification, highlighting a critical shortcoming in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing works focus on LLM instruction-following but overlook scenarios with conflicting constraints, which are common in complex prompts. LLM behavior under such conditions remains under-explored.

Method: Introduce ConInstruct benchmark to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Evaluate conflict detection performance and analyze conflict resolution behavior across various LLMs.

Result: 1) Proprietary LLMs show strong conflict detection (DeepSeek-R1: 91.5% F1, Claude-4.5-Sonnet: 87.3% F1), while most open-source models perform poorly except DeepSeek-R1. 2) LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about conflicts or request clarification despite detection capabilities.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have a critical shortcoming in handling conflicting instructions - they detect conflicts well but fail to communicate them to users, highlighting an important area for future improvement in instruction-following LLMs.

Abstract: Instruction-following is a critical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). While existing works primarily focus on assessing how well LLMs adhere to user instructions, they often overlook scenarios where instructions contain conflicting constraints-a common occurrence in complex prompts. The behavior of LLMs under such conditions remains under-explored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ConInstruct, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' ability to detect and resolve conflicts within user instructions. Using this dataset, we evaluate LLMs' conflict detection performance and analyze their conflict resolution behavior. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) Most proprietary LLMs exhibit strong conflict detection capabilities, whereas among open-source models, only DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates similarly strong performance. DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.5-Sonnet achieve the highest average F1-scores at 91.5% and 87.3%, respectively, ranking first and second overall. (2) Despite their strong conflict detection abilities, LLMs rarely explicitly notify users about the conflicts or request clarification when faced with conflicting constraints. These results underscore a critical shortcoming in current LLMs and highlight an important area for future improvement when designing instruction-following LLMs.

TL;DR: This paper addresses the tokenization bottleneck in applying LLMs to chemistry by unifying natural language and molecular representations through targeted vocabulary extension and continued pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with chemistry due to tokenizers fragmenting chemical representations like SMILES into uninformative sub-tokens, creating a tokenization bottleneck.

Method: Targeted vocabulary extension by adding chemically salient tokens to a pretrained LLM's vocabulary, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text.

Result: The methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks compared to standard approaches.

Conclusion: Unifying natural language and molecular representations through vocabulary extension and domain-specific pretraining effectively resolves the tokenization bottleneck in chemical applications of LLMs.

Abstract: The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a "tokenization bottleneck", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.

TL;DR: ATLAS is a new cross-disciplinary scientific benchmark designed to better evaluate advanced AI models' reasoning capabilities across multiple scientific domains, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks suffer from performance saturation, narrow focus, simplified formats, and data contamination issues, creating a gap with real-world scientific inquiry.

Method: Created ~800 original problems across 7 scientific fields by domain experts, featuring high originality, cross-disciplinary focus, complex open-ended answers, and rigorous quality control through peer review.

Result: Preliminary results show ATLAS effectively differentiates advanced scientific reasoning capabilities of leading models.

Conclusion: ATLAS will serve as a long-term community platform to reliably measure progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to performance saturation on many established benchmarks, questioning their ability to distinguish frontier models. Concurrently, existing high-difficulty benchmarks often suffer from narrow disciplinary focus, oversimplified answer formats, and vulnerability to data contamination, creating a fidelity gap with real-world scientific inquiry. To address these challenges, we introduce ATLAS (AGI-Oriented Testbed for Logical Application in Science), a large-scale, high-difficulty, and cross-disciplinary evaluation suite composed of approximately 800 original problems. Developed by domain experts (PhD-level and above), ATLAS spans seven core scientific fields: mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, earth science, and materials science. Its key features include: (1) High Originality and Contamination Resistance, with all questions newly created or substantially adapted to prevent test data leakage; (2) Cross-Disciplinary Focus, designed to assess models' ability to integrate knowledge and reason across scientific domains; (3) High-Fidelity Answers, prioritizing complex, open-ended answers involving multi-step reasoning and LaTeX-formatted expressions over simple multiple-choice questions; and (4) Rigorous Quality Control, employing a multi-stage process of expert peer review and adversarial testing to ensure question difficulty, scientific value, and correctness. We also propose a robust evaluation paradigm using a panel of LLM judges for automated, nuanced assessment of complex answers. Preliminary results on leading models demonstrate ATLAS's effectiveness in differentiating their advanced scientific reasoning capabilities. We plan to develop ATLAS into a long-term, open, community-driven platform to provide a reliable "ruler" for progress toward Artificial General Intelligence.

*Mario Sanz-Guerrero,Katharina von der Wense*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NCC addresses label length bias in LLMs by normalizing and calibrating predictions at the full-label level, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from label biases, particularly label length bias where multi-token class labels are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. Existing calibration methods overlook these biases.

Method: Proposed normalized contextual calibration (NCC) - a method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level to mitigate label length bias.

Result: NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches with gains of up to 10% F1 across multiple datasets and models. It also extends bias mitigation to broader tasks like multiple-choice question answering.

Conclusion: Mitigating full-label biases is crucial for improving LLM performance and robustness, especially in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens. NCC provides more reliable confidence estimates and requires fewer examples for competitive performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are powerful zero- and few-shot learners. However, when predicting over a set of candidate options, LLMs suffer from label biases, and existing calibration methods overlook biases arising from multi-token class labels. We tackle an issue we call label length bias, where labels of different lengths are treated inconsistently, even after standard length normalization. To mitigate it, we propose normalized contextual calibration (NCC), an effective method that normalizes and calibrates predictions at the full-label level. NCC achieves statistically significant improvements over prior approaches across multiple datasets and models, with gains of up to 10% F1. Moreover, NCC extends bias mitigation to broader tasks such as multiple-choice question answering. Our analysis shows that, when combined with in-context learning, NCC is less sensitive to few-shot example selection, requires fewer examples for competitive performance, and produces more reliable confidence estimates. These findings highlight the importance of mitigating full-label biases to improve the performance and robustness of LLM-based methods, particularly in real-world applications where class labels naturally consist of multiple tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EduHarm benchmark and TSSF framework address LLM safety vulnerabilities in educational contexts by systematically evaluating and defending against jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used in education but remain vulnerable to safety attacks; existing safety evaluations lack focus on educational scenarios' unique requirements.

Method: Created EduHarm benchmark with safe-unsafe instruction pairs across 5 educational scenarios; proposed TSSF framework with safety-aware attention realignment, layer-wise safety judgment, and defense-driven dual routing.

Result: TSSF effectively strengthens safety across 8 jailbreak attack strategies while preventing over-refusal; robust defense against fine-tuning attacks while preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides comprehensive safety protection for educational LLMs against both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks while maintaining educational utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into educational applications. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks, which can compromise safety alignment and lead to harmful outputs. Existing studies mainly focus on general safety evaluations, with limited attention to the unique safety requirements of educational scenarios. To address this gap, we construct EduHarm, a benchmark containing safe-unsafe instruction pairs across five representative educational scenarios, enabling systematic safety evaluation of educational LLMs. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage shield framework (TSSF) for educational LLMs that simultaneously mitigates both jailbreak and fine-tuning attacks. First, safety-aware attention realignment redirects attention toward critical unsafe tokens, thereby restoring the harmfulness feature that discriminates between unsafe and safe inputs. Second, layer-wise safety judgment identifies harmfulness features by aggregating safety cues across multiple layers to detect unsafe instructions. Finally, defense-driven dual routing separates safe and unsafe queries, ensuring normal processing for benign inputs and guarded responses for harmful ones. Extensive experiments across eight jailbreak attack strategies demonstrate that TSSF effectively strengthens safety while preventing over-refusal of benign queries. Evaluations on three fine-tuning attack datasets further show that it consistently achieves robust defense against harmful queries while maintaining preserving utility gains from benign fine-tuning.

TL;DR: MedBench v4 is a comprehensive medical AI evaluation framework with 700,000+ expert-curated tasks across multiple specialties. It shows base LLMs score 54.1/100 with poor safety (18.4/100), multimodal models perform worse (47.5/100), but agents significantly improve performance to 79.8/100.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need for evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints to properly assess advances in medical LLMs, multimodal models, and agents.

Method: Created a nationwide cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure with 700,000+ expert-curated tasks across 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, using multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from 500+ institutions, with LLM-as-a-judge scoring calibrated to human ratings.

Result: Base LLMs: mean 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), poor safety (18.4/100). Multimodal models: mean 47.5/100 (best: GPT-5, 54.9/100). Agents: mean 79.8/100 (Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents up to 85.3/100 overall, 88.9/100 on safety).

Conclusion: Persisting gaps exist in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, but governance-aware agentic orchestration can significantly enhance clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. The platform provides practical reference for medical AI auditing.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical large language models (LLMs), multimodal models, and agents demand evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical workflows and safety constraints. We present MedBench v4, a nationwide, cloud-based benchmarking infrastructure comprising over 700,000 expert-curated tasks spanning 24 primary and 91 secondary specialties, with dedicated tracks for LLMs, multimodal models, and agents. Items undergo multi-stage refinement and multi-round review by clinicians from more than 500 institutions, and open-ended responses are scored by an LLM-as-a-judge calibrated to human ratings. We evaluate 15 frontier models. Base LLMs reach a mean overall score of 54.1/100 (best: Claude Sonnet 4.5, 62.5/100), but safety and ethics remain low (18.4/100). Multimodal models perform worse overall (mean 47.5/100; best: GPT-5, 54.9/100), with solid perception yet weaker cross-modal reasoning. Agents built on the same backbones substantially improve end-to-end performance (mean 79.8/100), with Claude Sonnet 4.5-based agents achieving up to 85.3/100 overall and 88.9/100 on safety tasks. MedBench v4 thus reveals persisting gaps in multimodal reasoning and safety for base models, while showing that governance-aware agentic orchestration can markedly enhance benchmarked clinical readiness without sacrificing capability. By aligning tasks with Chinese clinical guidelines and regulatory priorities, the platform offers a practical reference for hospitals, developers, and policymakers auditing medical AI.

Abstract: We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study. This work highlights opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration between NLP researchers and mental health professionals to advance responsible innovation in human-AI interaction for well-being.

TL;DR: This paper introduces Agent-R1, a modular RL training framework for LLM Agents, and systematically extends MDP to define LLM Agent components, validated on Multihop QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL shows potential for training LLM Agents but faces challenges due to lack of tailored approaches and flexible training frameworks in this emerging field.

Method: Systematically extended MDP framework to define LLM Agent components and introduced Agent-R1, a modular RL training framework for LLM Agents.

Result: Experimental validation on Multihop QA benchmark tasks provided initial evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed methods and framework.

Conclusion: The paper advances RL methodologies for LLM Agents through systematic framework extension and introduces a practical training solution that shows promising initial results.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored for building Agents capable of active environmental interaction (e.g., via tool use) to solve complex problems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered a key technology with significant potential for training such Agents; however, the effective application of RL to LLM Agents is still in its nascent stages and faces considerable challenges. Currently, this emerging field lacks in-depth exploration into RL approaches specifically tailored for the LLM Agent context, alongside a scarcity of flexible and easily extensible training frameworks designed for this purpose. To help advance this area, this paper first revisits and clarifies Reinforcement Learning methodologies for LLM Agents by systematically extending the Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to comprehensively define the key components of an LLM Agent. Secondly, we introduce Agent-R1, a modular, flexible, and user-friendly training framework for RL-based LLM Agents, designed for straightforward adaptation across diverse task scenarios and interactive environments. We conducted experiments on Multihop QA benchmark tasks, providing initial validation for the effectiveness of our proposed methods and framework.

Result: Benchmark shows question diversity, wide difficulty range, and usefulness in differentiating system capabilities.

Conclusion: LiveRAG benchmark will help advance RAG research, enable systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

Abstract: With Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becoming more and more prominent in generative AI solutions, there is an emerging need for systematically evaluating their effectiveness. We introduce the LiveRAG benchmark, a publicly available dataset of 895 synthetic questions and answers designed to support systematic evaluation of RAG-based Q&A systems. This synthetic benchmark is derived from the one used during the SIGIR'2025 LiveRAG Challenge, where competitors were evaluated under strict time constraints. It is augmented with information that was not made available to competitors during the Challenge, such as the ground-truth answers, together with their associated supporting claims which were used for evaluating competitors' answers. In addition, each question is associated with estimated difficulty and discriminability scores, derived from applying an Item Response Theory model to competitors' responses. Our analysis highlights the benchmark's questions diversity, the wide range of their difficulty levels, and their usefulness in differentiating between system capabilities. The LiveRAG benchmark will hopefully help the community advance RAG research, conduct systematic evaluation, and develop more robust Q&A systems.

TL;DR: This paper addresses document-level claim extraction evaluation by proposing alignment methods to compare model-extracted and human-annotated claims, tested on Czech/Slovak news comments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document-level claim extraction is challenging in fact-checking, and current evaluation methods for extracted claims are limited and need improvement.

Method: Developed approaches to align two sets of claims from the same document and compute similarity scores, focusing on finding optimal alignment and evaluation methods.

Result: Experiments on Czech/Slovak news comment datasets revealed limitations of current evaluation approaches, showing they struggle with informal language, local context, and language subtleties.

Conclusion: There's a need for more advanced evaluation methods that can better capture semantic similarity and assess key claim properties like atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

Abstract: Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.

TL;DR: Using EHR data, researchers identified 15 distinct clinical states after AKI and found varying CKD progression risks across these states, with both established and novel risk factors influencing outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging.

Method: Used EHR data to track AKI patients' clinical evolution through clustering patient vectors from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements, then applied multi-state modeling to estimate transition probabilities and CKD progression.

Result: Of 20,699 AKI patients, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. Identified 15 distinct post-AKI states with different CKD probabilities, with 75% of patients remaining in single states or making only one transition. Found both established and novel CKD risk factors with varying impacts across clinical states.

Conclusion: This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

Abstract: Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well large language models align with human judgment in detecting political bias in news media, as this remains relatively underexplored.

Method: Constructed manually annotated dataset of news articles and assessed annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement across GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN models.

Result: RoBERTa achieved highest alignment with human labels among transformer models, while GPT demonstrated strongest zero-shot agreement with human annotations. Fine-tuned RoBERTa obtained highest accuracy.

Conclusion: Systematic differences exist in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, highlighting need for hybrid evaluation frameworks combining human interpretability with model scalability.

Abstract: Detecting political bias in news media is a complex task that requires interpreting subtle linguistic and contextual cues. Although recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have enabled automatic bias classification, the extent to which large language models (LLMs) align with human judgment still remains relatively underexplored and not yet well understood. This study aims to present a comparative framework for evaluating the detection of political bias across human annotations and multiple LLMs, including GPT, BERT, RoBERTa, and FLAN. We construct a manually annotated dataset of news articles and assess annotation consistency, bias polarity, and inter-model agreement to quantify divergence between human and model perceptions of bias. Experimental results show that among traditional transformer-based models, RoBERTa achieves the highest alignment with human labels, whereas generative models such as GPT demonstrate the strongest overall agreement with human annotations in a zero-shot setting. Among all transformer-based baselines, our fine-tuned RoBERTa model acquired the highest accuracy and the strongest alignment with human-annotated labels. Our findings highlight systematic differences in how humans and LLMs perceive political slant, underscoring the need for hybrid evaluation frameworks that combine human interpretability with model scalability in automated media bias detection.

Motivation: To enable autonomous scientific discovery systems that can self-correct errors and adapt to new datasets without human intervention, improving reliability and interpretability.

Method: Using VLMs as judges to evaluate figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, treating plots as verifiable checkpoints for multi-agent systems to correct errors and steer exploratory data analysis.

Result: VLM-augmented systems achieved pass@1 scores of 0.7-0.8 on a 10-task benchmark, significantly outperforming code-only (0.2-0.3) and code-and-text baselines (0.4-0.5), while providing auditable reasoning traces.

Conclusion: VLM-guided multi-agent systems effectively improve autonomous scientific discovery by enabling real-time error correction, adaptation to new datasets, and providing interpretable reasoning traces.

Abstract: We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability.

TL;DR: RareSeek R1 is a specialized AI system for rare disease diagnosis that combines clinical narratives with genetic data, achieving physician-level accuracy through staged training and graph-based retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the long diagnostic odyssey for rare diseases by overcoming limitations of conventional pipelines and general LLMs, which face scarce EHR data, outdated knowledge, and hallucinations.

Method: Developed via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph-grounded retrieval using a large clinical corpus and clinician-validated reasoning set.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, with robust generalization and stability under noisy conditions. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians.

Conclusion: Advances a narrative-first, knowledge-integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens diagnostic timelines and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

Abstract: Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support.

### [38] [Graded strength of comparative illusions is explained by Bayesian inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14642)
*Yuhan Zhang,Erxiao Wang,Cory Shain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study develops a quantitative Bayesian model to explain comparative illusions in language processing, showing that illusion strength correlates with posterior probabilities of plausible interpretations derived from language models and human data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test and extend the noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by explaining fine gradations in comparative illusion strength and previously unexplained effects of pronominal vs. full noun phrase subjects.

Method: Developed a quantitative model combining statistical language models with human behavioral data to compute posterior probabilities of plausible interpretations of comparative illusion sentences.

Result: The model successfully explained both the gradations in comparative illusion strength and the effect of pronominal vs. full noun phrase subjects, supporting noisy-channel inference as the underlying mechanism.

Conclusion: Noisy-channel inference provides a unified computational-level theory that explains diverse language processing phenomena, including both illusory and non-illusory contexts.

Abstract: Like visual processing, language processing is susceptible to illusions in which people systematically misperceive stimuli. In one such case--the comparative illusion (CI), e.g., More students have been to Russia than I have--comprehenders tend to judge the sentence as acceptable despite its underlying nonsensical comparison. Prior research has argued that this phenomenon can be explained as Bayesian inference over a noisy channel: the posterior probability of an interpretation of a sentence is proportional to both the prior probability of that interpretation and the likelihood of corruption into the observed (CI) sentence. Initial behavioral work has supported this claim by evaluating a narrow set of alternative interpretations of CI sentences and showing that comprehenders favor interpretations that are more likely to have been corrupted into the illusory sentence. In this study, we replicate and go substantially beyond this earlier work by directly predicting the strength of illusion with a quantitative model of the posterior probability of plausible interpretations, which we derive through a novel synthesis of statistical language models with human behavioral data. Our model explains not only the fine gradations in the strength of CI effects, but also a previously unexplained effect caused by pronominal vs. full noun phrase than-clause subjects. These findings support a noisy-channel theory of sentence comprehension by demonstrating that the theory makes novel predictions about the comparative illusion that bear out empirically. This outcome joins related evidence of noisy channel processing in both illusory and non-illusory contexts to support noisy channel inference as a unified computational-level theory of diverse language processing phenomena.

Motivation: Annotation bias in NLP datasets is a major challenge for developing multilingual LLMs, particularly in culturally diverse settings, as it can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms.

Method: The authors propose a typology of annotation bias (instruction, annotator, contextual/cultural), review detection methods (inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, metadata analysis), and outline mitigation strategies including diverse annotator recruitment and ensemble-based approaches.

Result: The paper contributes a comprehensive framework for annotation bias, including a typology, detection metrics synthesis, ensemble-based mitigation approach for multilingual settings, and ethical analysis of annotation processes.

Conclusion: The proposed insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs, addressing bias through systematic detection and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Annotation bias in NLP datasets remains a major challenge for developing multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in culturally diverse settings. Bias from task framing, annotator subjectivity, and cultural mismatches can distort model outputs and exacerbate social harms. We propose a comprehensive framework for understanding annotation bias, distinguishing among instruction bias, annotator bias, and contextual and cultural bias. We review detection methods (including inter-annotator agreement, model disagreement, and metadata analysis) and highlight emerging techniques such as multilingual model divergence and cultural inference. We further outline proactive and reactive mitigation strategies, including diverse annotator recruitment, iterative guideline refinement, and post-hoc model adjustments. Our contributions include: (1) a typology of annotation bias; (2) a synthesis of detection metrics; (3) an ensemble-based bias mitigation approach adapted for multilingual settings, and (4) an ethical analysis of annotation processes. Together, these insights aim to inform more equitable and culturally grounded annotation pipelines for LLMs.

TL;DR: A modular RAG framework for contract management that identifies problematic revisions and generates improved alternatives with over 80% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating contract management is challenging due to scarce labeled data and unstructured legacy contracts, requiring a solution that works in low-resource conditions.

Method: Retrieval-augmented generation pipeline with synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment.

Result: Achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions under real-world, low-resource conditions.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for accelerating contract revision workflows through automated identification and improvement of problematic provisions.

Abstract: Contract management involves reviewing and negotiating provisions, individual clauses that define rights, obligations, and terms of agreement. During this process, revisions to provisions are proposed and iteratively refined, some of which may be problematic or unacceptable. Automating this workflow is challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data and the abundance of unstructured legacy contracts. In this paper, we present a modular framework designed to streamline contract management through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system integrates synthetic data generation, semantic clause retrieval, acceptability classification, and reward-based alignment to flag problematic revisions and generate improved alternatives. Developed and evaluated in collaboration with an industry partner, our system achieves over 80% accuracy in both identifying and optimizing problematic revisions, demonstrating strong performance under real-world, low-resource conditions and offering a practical means of accelerating contract revision workflows.

### [41] [Quadratic Term Correction on Heaps' Law](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14683)
*Oscar Fontanelli,Wentian Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges Heaps' law by showing that type-token curves in log-log scale are slightly concave, not linear, and proposes quadratic functions for better fitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the observed deviation from Heaps' law where type-token curves remain concave even in log-log scale, invalidating the power-law assumption.

Method: Analyzed twenty English novels/writings using regression of log(type)-log(token) data with linear and quadratic terms, and used a random drawing colored ball model to explain the curvature.

Result: Quadratic functions in log-log scale fit type-token data perfectly, with linear coefficients slightly larger than 1 and quadratic coefficients around -0.02, indicating consistent concave curvature.

Conclusion: The curvature in log-log scale corresponds to a negative pseudo-variance, providing a theoretical explanation for the deviation from Heaps' law, though numerical instability may occur with large token counts.

Abstract: Heaps' or Herdan's law characterizes the word-type vs. word-token relation by a power-law function, which is concave in linear-linear scale but a straight line in log-log scale. However, it has been observed that even in log-log scale, the type-token curve is still slightly concave, invalidating the power-law relation. At the next-order approximation, we have shown, by twenty English novels or writings (some are translated from another language to English), that quadratic functions in log-log scale fit the type-token data perfectly. Regression analyses of log(type)-log(token) data with both a linear and quadratic term consistently lead to a linear coefficient of slightly larger than 1, and a quadratic coefficient around -0.02. Using the ``random drawing colored ball from the bag with replacement" model, we have shown that the curvature of the log-log scale is identical to a ``pseudo-variance" which is negative. Although a pseudo-variance calculation may encounter numeric instability when the number of tokens is large, due to the large values of pseudo-weights, this formalism provides a rough estimation of the curvature when the number of tokens is small.

TL;DR: SMRC is a novel method that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to correct student mathematical reasoning errors by aligning LLMs with student reasoning patterns, outperforming existing approaches on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM correction methods focus on self-correction but lack the systematic guidance needed for educational settings where teachers correct student reasoning processes step-by-step.

Method: Formulates student reasoning as multi-step sequential decision problem, uses MCTS to explore optimal correction paths, employs BFS with LLM guidance for reward generation, and distributes rewards via back-propagation for process supervision.

Result: SMRC significantly outperforms existing methods on ProcessBench, MR-GSM8K, and their new MSEB benchmark in both solution accuracy and correct-step retention metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed SMRC method effectively addresses the gap in educational-style correction of student mathematical reasoning and demonstrates superior performance across multiple evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often make reasoning errors when solving mathematical problems, and how to automatically detect and correct these errors has become an important research direction. However, existing approaches \textit{mainly focus on self-correction within the model}, which falls short of the ``teacher-style`` correction required in educational settings, \textit{i.e.}, systematically guiding and revising a student's problem-solving process. To address this gap, we propose \texttt{SMRC} (\textit{\underline{S}tudent \underline{M}athematical \underline{R}easoning \underline{C}orrection}), a novel method that aligns LLMs with student reasoning. Specifically, \texttt{SMRC} formulates student reasoning as a multi-step sequential decision problem and introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore optimal correction paths. To reduce the cost of the annotating process-level rewards, we leverage breadth-first search (BFS) guided by LLMs and final-answer evaluation to generate reward signals, which are then distributed across intermediate reasoning steps via a back-propagation mechanism, enabling fine-grained process supervision. Additionally, we construct a benchmark for high school mathematics, MSEB (Multi-Solution Error Benchmark), consisting of 158 instances that include problem statements, student solutions, and correct reasoning steps. We further propose a dual evaluation protocol centered on \textbf{solution accuracy} and \textbf{correct-step retention}, offering a comprehensive measure of educational applicability. Experiments demonstrate that \texttt{SMRC} significantly outperforms existing methods on two public datasets (ProcessBench and MR-GSM8K) and our MSEB in terms of effectiveness and overall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics from scientific measurements, using astrophysics as a test bed.

Method: Using sparse autoencoders to extract interpretable features from text, examining the role of prompting and important language aspects in encoding physics.

Result: LLM embeddings can represent physical quantities obtained from scientific measurements, with prompting strategies and specific language components affecting the encoding quality.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for encoding physical information from text, with prompting and language structure playing crucial roles in how physics is represented in embeddings.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated the ability to generalize well at many levels across domains, modalities, and even shown in-context learning capabilities. This enables research questions regarding how they can be used to encode physical information that is usually only available from scientific measurements, and loosely encoded in textual descriptions. Using astrophysics as a test bed, we investigate if LLM embeddings can codify physical summary statistics that are obtained from scientific measurements through two main questions: 1) Does prompting play a role on how those quantities are codified by the LLM? and 2) What aspects of language are most important in encoding the physics represented by the measurement? We investigate this using sparse autoencoders that extract interpretable features from the text.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical and low-resource NLP faces challenges due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern corpora, making computational humanities research difficult.

Method: Leverage large language models to create synthetic ground-truth annotations for historical texts, then use this data to fine-tune spaCy models for domain-specific NLP tasks.

Result: Achieved significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition using the LLM-generated synthetic data.

Conclusion: Domain-specific models are crucial for historical NLP, and even limited amounts of synthetic data can substantially improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities.

Abstract: Historical and low-resource NLP remains challenging due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern, web-sourced corpora. This paper outlines our work in using large language models (LLMs) to create ground-truth annotations for historical French (16th-20th centuries) and Chinese (1900-1950) texts. By leveraging LLM-generated ground truth on a subset of our corpus, we were able to fine-tune spaCy to achieve significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech (POS) annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.

TL;DR: VALOR is a multimodal complaint analysis framework that uses customer support dialogues with both text and visual evidence for fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity, outperforming baselines through expert routing and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing complaint analysis methods rely on unimodal, short-form content, but real customer support involves multimodal, multi-turn dialogues where users share both textual complaints and visual evidence like screenshots.

Method: VALOR uses a multi-expert reasoning setup with large-scale generative models and Chain-of-Thought prompting, computes semantic alignment scores between modalities, and integrates them through meta-fusion for final classification.

Result: VALOR consistently outperforms baseline models on a curated multimodal complaint dataset, especially in complex scenarios where information is distributed across text and images.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems, supporting UN SDGs 9 and 12 through improved service infrastructure and consumer accountability.

Abstract: Existing approaches to complaint analysis largely rely on unimodal, short-form content such as tweets or product reviews. This work advances the field by leveraging multimodal, multi-turn customer support dialogues, where users often share both textual complaints and visual evidence (e.g., screenshots, product photos) to enable fine-grained classification of complaint aspects and severity. We introduce VALOR, a Validation-Aware Learner with Expert Routing, tailored for this multimodal setting. It employs a multi-expert reasoning setup using large-scale generative models with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for nuanced decision-making. To ensure coherence between modalities, a semantic alignment score is computed and integrated into the final classification through a meta-fusion strategy. In alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the proposed framework supports SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) by advancing AI-driven tools for robust, scalable, and context-aware service infrastructure. Further, by enabling structured analysis of complaint narratives and visual context, it contributes to SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by promoting more responsive product design and improved accountability in consumer services. We evaluate VALOR on a curated multimodal complaint dataset annotated with fine-grained aspect and severity labels, showing that it consistently outperforms baseline models, especially in complex complaint scenarios where information is distributed across text and images. This study underscores the value of multimodal interaction and expert validation in practical complaint understanding systems.

*Ali Salehi,Cassandra L. Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparison of tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings shows morpheme-based approach outperforms BPE when accounting for evaluation biases and coverage differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate optimal tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings, particularly comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks.

Method: Developed a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation, and evaluated Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization.

Result: BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity but only evaluates 28.6% of test cases vs 68.7% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. Morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels.

Conclusion: Morpheme-based tokenization is superior for Kurdish embeddings when accounting for coverage biases, highlighting the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing.

Abstract: We investigate tokenization strategies for Kurdish word embeddings by comparing word-level, morpheme-based, and BPE approaches on morphological similarity preservation tasks. We develop a BiLSTM-CRF morphological segmenter using bootstrapped training from minimal manual annotation and evaluate Word2Vec embeddings across comprehensive metrics including similarity preservation, clustering quality, and semantic organization. Our analysis reveals critical evaluation biases in tokenization comparison. While BPE initially appears superior in morphological similarity, it evaluates only 28.6\% of test cases compared to 68.7\% for morpheme model, creating artificial performance inflation. When assessed comprehensively, morpheme-based tokenization demonstrates superior embedding space organization, better semantic neighborhood structure, and more balanced coverage across morphological complexity levels. These findings highlight the importance of coverage-aware evaluation in low-resource language processing and offers different tokenization methods for low-resourced language processing.

*Zhijie Qiao,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: nuCarla is a large-scale BEV perception dataset built in CARLA simulator that addresses the lack of standardized datasets for closed-loop autonomous driving simulation, enabling better training and evaluation of end-to-end models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing real-world datasets are collected under non-interactive conditions and don't support closed-loop testing well, making end-to-end autonomous driving models perform worse than simple rule-based baselines due to lack of proper training data.

Method: Created nuCarla - a nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset within CARLA simulator with full nuScenes format compatibility, comparable scale to nuScenes but with more balanced class distributions, and direct usability for closed-loop simulation.

Result: The dataset enables seamless transfer of real-world perception models and provides high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results.

Conclusion: nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop end-to-end autonomous driving development by providing both data and models as open benchmarks, paving the way for more reliable and safety-aware research.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving heavily relies on closed-loop simulation, where perception, planning, and control are jointly trained and evaluated in interactive environments. Yet, most existing datasets are collected from the real world under non-interactive conditions, primarily supporting open-loop learning while offering limited value for closed-loop testing. Due to the lack of standardized, large-scale, and thoroughly verified datasets to facilitate learning of meaningful intermediate representations, such as bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, closed-loop E2E models remain far behind even simple rule-based baselines. To address this challenge, we introduce nuCarla, a large-scale, nuScenes-style BEV perception dataset built within the CARLA simulator. nuCarla features (1) full compatibility with the nuScenes format, enabling seamless transfer of real-world perception models; (2) a dataset scale comparable to nuScenes, but with more balanced class distributions; (3) direct usability for closed-loop simulation deployment; and (4) high-performance BEV backbones that achieve state-of-the-art detection results. By providing both data and models as open benchmarks, nuCarla substantially accelerates closed-loop E2E development, paving the way toward reliable and safety-aware research in autonomous driving.

*Dongdong Zhao,Ranxin Fang,Changtian Song,Zhihui Liu,Jianwen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a framework to mitigate overconfidence in Open Set Recognition by using perturbation-based uncertainty estimation and two-stage unknown detection to better separate known and unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overconfidence in OSR where unknown samples similar to known classes get high confidence scores, blurring decision boundaries and causing misclassification.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) perturbation-based uncertainty estimation with controllable parameter perturbations for diverse predictions, 2) two-stage unknown detection with learning-based classifiers using estimated uncertainty.

Result: Superior performance over existing OSR methods demonstrated on three public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap and enhances OSR performance through uncertainty-aware detection.

Abstract: Open Set Recognition (OSR) requires models not only to accurately classify known classes but also to effectively reject unknown samples. However, when unknown samples are semantically similar to known classes, inter-class overlap in the feature space often causes models to assign unjustifiably high confidence to them, leading to misclassification as known classes -- a phenomenon known as overconfidence. This overconfidence undermines OSR by blurring the decision boundary between known and unknown classes. To address this issue, we propose a framework that explicitly mitigates overconfidence caused by inter-class overlap. The framework consists of two components: a perturbation-based uncertainty estimation module, which applies controllable parameter perturbations to generate diverse predictions and quantify predictive uncertainty, and an unknown detection module with distinct learning-based classifiers, implemented as a two-stage procedure, which leverages the estimated uncertainty to improve discrimination between known and unknown classes, thereby enhancing OSR performance. Experimental results on three public datasets show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over existing OSR methods.

TL;DR: A novel object-aware temporal modeling approach for few-shot video object detection that selectively propagates high-confidence features across frames, achieving significant performance improvements without complex region proposals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video object detection methods require extensive labeled data and struggle with temporal consistency issues like occlusion and appearance variations. Few-shot approaches need to generalize to novel objects while avoiding computationally expensive region proposal methods.

Method: Object-aware temporal modeling with filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames, using few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation.

Result: Achieved AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5% (VidVRD) in 5-shot setting, with additional improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations.

Conclusion: The approach enables robust temporal consistency and efficient feature progression for few-shot video object detection without relying on explicit object tube proposals, demonstrating significant performance gains across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Few-shot Video Object Detection (FSVOD) addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects in videos with limited labeled examples, overcoming the constraints of traditional detection methods that require extensive training data. This task presents key challenges, including maintaining temporal consistency across frames affected by occlusion and appearance variations, and achieving novel object generalization without relying on complex region proposals, which are often computationally expensive and require task-specific training. Our novel object-aware temporal modeling approach addresses these challenges by incorporating a filtering mechanism that selectively propagates high-confidence object features across frames. This enables efficient feature progression, reduces noise accumulation, and enhances detection accuracy in a few-shot setting. By utilizing few-shot trained detection and classification heads with focused feature propagation, we achieve robust temporal consistency without depending on explicit object tube proposals. Our approach achieves performance gains, with AP improvements of 3.7% (FSVOD-500), 5.3% (FSYTV-40), 4.3% (VidOR), and 4.5 (VidVRD) in the 5-shot setting. Further results demonstrate improvements in 1-shot, 3-shot, and 10-shot configurations. We make the code public at: https://github.com/yogesh-iitj/fs-video-vit

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image fusion method using flow matching for efficient probabilistic transport from source modalities to fused images, with pseudo-label selection and refinement to overcome lack of supervised data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-modal image fusion methods are task-specific with high training costs, while generative methods suffer from slow inference due to complex sampling trajectories.

Method: Formulates fusion as probabilistic transport using flow matching, collects pseudo-labels from SOTA models with task-aware selection, adds Fusion Refiner module for enhancement, and uses elastic weight consolidation for multi-task learning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks with significantly improved sampling efficiency and lightweight model design.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an efficient and scalable solution for multi-modal image fusion that overcomes limitations of existing methods while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Current multi-modal image fusion methods typically rely on task-specific models, leading to high training costs and limited scalability. While generative methods provide a unified modeling perspective, they often suffer from slow inference due to the complex sampling trajectories from noise to image. To address this, we formulate image fusion as a direct probabilistic transport from source modalities to the fused image distribution, leveraging the flow matching paradigm to improve sampling efficiency and structural consistency. To mitigate the lack of high-quality fused images for supervision, we collect fusion results from multiple state-of-the-art models as priors, and employ a task-aware selection function to select the most reliable pseudo-labels for each task. We further introduce a Fusion Refiner module that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy to systematically identify, decompose, and enhance degraded components in selected pseudo-labels. For multi-task scenarios, we integrate elastic weight consolidation and experience replay mechanisms to preserve cross-task performance and enhance continual learning ability from both parameter stability and memory retention perspectives. Our approach achieves competitive performance across diverse fusion tasks, while significantly improving sampling efficiency and maintaining a lightweight model design.

### [52] [A Trajectory-free Crash Detection Framework with Generative Approach and Segment Map Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13795)
*Weiying Shen,Hao Yu,Yu Dong,Pan Liu,Yu Han,Xin Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework using diffusion models to generate realistic road segment maps and identify crashes by comparing monitored maps with generated ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking by using road segment maps with individual-level traffic dynamic data for real-time crash detection to enhance traffic safety and efficiency.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Mapfusion diffusion model adds noise to road segment maps then denoises with temporal embeddings and ControlNet for context, 2) Crash detection by comparing monitored maps with generated maps from diffusion model trained on non-crash data.

Result: Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps, remains robust across different sampling intervals, and effectively detects crashes in real-world experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage trajectory-free method is effective for accurate crash detection using road segment maps without requiring vehicle trajectory data.

Abstract: Real-time crash detection is essential for developing proactive safety management strategy and enhancing overall traffic efficiency. To address the limitations associated with trajectory acquisition and vehicle tracking, road segment maps recording the individual-level traffic dynamic data were directly served in crash detection. A novel two-stage trajectory-free crash detection framework, was present to generate the rational future road segment map and identify crashes. The first-stage diffusion-based segment map generation model, Mapfusion, conducts a noisy-to-normal process that progressively adds noise to the road segment map until the map is corrupted to pure Gaussian noise. The denoising process is guided by sequential embedding components capturing the temporal dynamics of segment map sequences. Furthermore, the generation model is designed to incorporate background context through ControlNet to enhance generation control. Crash detection is achieved by comparing the monitored segment map with the generations from diffusion model in second stage. Trained on non-crash vehicle motion data, Mapfusion successfully generates realistic road segment evolution maps based on learned motion patterns and remains robust across different sampling intervals. Experiments on real-world crashes indicate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage method in accurately detecting crashes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADATG: Adaptive two-grid foundation model with Hilbert encoding for seismic data that separates high/low frequencies and uses progressive training from coarse to fine features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers struggle with seismic data's unique frequency characteristics - existing ViTs ignore intrinsic patterns and fail to efficiently capture both high and low frequency information in seismograms.

Method: Uses spectrum decomposition to separate frequency components, hierarchical Hilbert encoding, and adaptive training strategy that starts with coarse information then refines to fine features based on frequency principle.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness and efficiency of the training methods for seismic foundation models.

Conclusion: Proper data encoding and training strategies tailored to seismic data's frequency characteristics are crucial for enhancing visual seismic foundation model pretraining.

Abstract: Due to the emergency and homogenization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology development, transformer-based foundation models have revolutionized scientific applications, such as drug discovery, materials research, and astronomy. However, seismic data presents unique characteristics that require specialized processing techniques for pretraining foundation models in seismic contexts with high- and low-frequency features playing crucial roles. Existing vision transformers (ViTs) with sequential tokenization ignore the intrinsic pattern and fail to grasp both the high- and low-frequency seismic information efficiently and effectively. This work introduces a novel adaptive two-grid foundation model training strategy (ADATG) with Hilbert encoding specifically tailored for seismogram data, leveraging the hierarchical structures inherent in seismic data. Specifically, our approach employs spectrum decomposition to separate high- and low-frequency components and utilizes hierarchical Hilbert encoding to represent the data effectively. Moreover, observing the frequency principle observed in ViTs, we propose an adaptive training strategy that initially emphasizes coarse-level information and then progressively refines the model's focus on fine-level features. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our training methods. This research highlights the importance of data encoding and training strategies informed by the distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in seismic images, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of visual seismic foundation models pretraining.

*Filippo Cenacchi. Longbing Cao,Mitchell McEwan,Deborah Richards*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a language-free dementia screening method using facial micro dynamics from short talking head videos, achieving high performance without speech or text analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dementia screening methods rely on speech or scripted interviews, limiting scalability and requiring clinical intervention. The authors aim to develop a passive, scalable screening approach that works across devices, topics, and cultures without language dependency.

Method: The method analyzes temporal facial kinematics including blink dynamics, mouth/jaw motions, gaze variability, and head adjustments. It stabilizes facial signals, converts micro movements into interpretable time series, smooths them, and summarizes into clip-level statistics based on activity mix distribution across motion streams.

Result: On the YT DemTalk dataset (300 clips: 150 dementia, 150 controls), the method achieved AUROC of 0.953, Average Precision of 0.961, F1-score of 0.851, and accuracy of 0.857. Gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics were identified as the most informative cues.

Conclusion: Facial temporal micro dynamics are sufficient for effective dementia screening without speech or text, enabling scalable, passive screening that is transferable across devices and cultures.

Abstract: We target passive dementia screening from short camera-facing talking head video, developing a facial temporal micro dynamics analysis for language free detection of early neuro cognitive change. This enables unscripted, in the wild video analysis at scale to capture natural facial behaviors, transferrable across devices, topics, and cultures without active intervention by clinicians or researchers during recording. Most existing resources prioritize speech or scripted interviews, limiting use outside clinics and coupling predictions to language and transcription. In contrast, we identify and analyze whether temporal facial kinematics, including blink dynamics, small mouth jaw motions, gaze variability, and subtle head adjustments, are sufficient for dementia screening without speech or text. By stabilizing facial signals, we convert these micro movements into interpretable facial microdynamic time series, smooth them, and summarize short windows into compact clip level statistics for screening. Each window is encoded by its activity mix (the relative share of motion across streams), thus the predictor analyzes the distribution of motion across streams rather than its magnitude, making per channel effects transparent. We also introduce YT DemTalk, a new dataset curated from publicly available, in the wild camera facing videos. It contains 300 clips (150 with self reported dementia, 150 controls) to test our model and offer a first benchmarking of the corpus. On YT DemTalk, ablations identify gaze lability and mouth/jaw dynamics as the most informative cues, and light weighted shallow classifiers could attain a dementia prediction performance of (AUROC) 0.953, 0.961 Average Precision (AP), 0.851 F1-score, and 0.857 accuracy.

TL;DR: Gen-ViRe is a new benchmark that quantitatively assesses video generation models' Chain-of-Frames reasoning capabilities across six cognitive dimensions, revealing gaps between visual quality and actual reasoning depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on fidelity or alignment but fail to assess core cognitive abilities like multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, and abstract pattern extrapolation in Chain-of-Frames reasoning, creating an evaluation void.

Method: Developed Gen-ViRe framework that decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions and 24 subtasks, using multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria.

Result: Experiments on state-of-the-art systems revealed substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools.

Conclusion: Gen-ViRe provides the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners, enabling systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for advancing genuine world simulators.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables sophisticated symbolic reasoning in LLMs, it remains confined to discrete text and cannot simulate the continuous, physics-governed dynamics of the real world. Recent video generation models have emerged as potential world simulators through Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning -- materializing thought as frame-by-frame visual sequences, with each frame representing a physically-grounded reasoning step. Despite compelling demonstrations, a challenge persists: existing benchmarks, focusing on fidelity or alignment, do not assess CoF reasoning and thus cannot measure core cognitive abilities in multi-step planning, algorithmic logic, or abstract pattern extrapolation. This evaluation void prevents systematic understanding of model capabilities and principled guidance for improvement. We introduce Gen-ViRe (Generative Visual Reasoning Benchmark), a framework grounded in cognitive science and real-world AI applications, which decomposes CoF reasoning into six cognitive dimensions -- from perceptual logic to abstract planning -- and 24 subtasks. Through multi-source data curation, minimal prompting protocols, and hybrid VLM-assisted evaluation with detailed criteria, Gen-ViRe delivers the first quantitative assessment of video models as reasoners. Our experiments on SOTA systems reveal substantial discrepancies between impressive visual quality and actual reasoning depth, establishing baselines and diagnostic tools to advance genuine world simulators.

### [56] [RSPose: Ranking Based Losses for Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13857)
*Muhammed Can Keles,Bedrettin Cetinkaya,Sinan Kalkan,Emre Akbas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes ranking-based losses to address three key problems in heatmap-based human pose estimation: MSE loss limitations, heatmap imbalance, and metric-loss discrepancy. The method improves correlation between confidence scores and localization quality, leading to better mAP performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve three main problems in heatmap-based pose estimation: (1) MSE loss doesn't effectively sharpen joint localization peaks, (2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced, and (3) there's a mismatch between evaluation metric (mAP) and loss functions.

Method: Proposes ranking-based losses that align with the mAP evaluation metric. The method works with both 1D and 2D heatmaps and is applied to various pose estimation models including ViTPose-H and SimCC Resnet-50.

Result: RSPose achieves 79.9 mAP on COCO-val with ViTPose-H, outperforming previous state-of-the-art. Also improves SimCC Resnet-50 by 1.5 AP to 73.6 AP on COCO-val. Shows superior performance across COCO, CrowdPose, and MPII datasets.

Conclusion: Ranking-based losses effectively address key limitations in heatmap-based pose estimation, improving correlation between confidence and localization quality, and achieving state-of-the-art performance while aligning losses with evaluation metrics.

Abstract: While heatmap-based human pose estimation methods have shown strong performance, they suffer from three main problems: (P1) "Commonly used Mean Squared Error (MSE)" Loss may not always improve joint localization because it penalizes all pixel deviations equally, without focusing explicitly on sharpening and correctly localizing the peak corresponding to the joint; (P2) heatmaps are spatially and class-wise imbalanced; and, (P3) there is a discrepancy between the evaluation metric (i.e., mAP) and the loss functions.
  We propose ranking-based losses to address these issues.
  Both theoretically and empirically, we show that our proposed losses are superior to commonly used heatmap losses (MSE, KL-Divergence). Our losses considerably increase the correlation between confidence scores and localization qualities, which is desirable because higher correlation leads to more accurate instance selection during Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and better Average Precision (mAP) performance. We refer to the models trained with our losses as RSPose.
  We show the effectiveness of RSPose across two different modes: one-dimensional and two-dimensional heatmaps, on three different datasets (COCO, CrowdPose, MPII).
  To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose losses that align with the evaluation metric (mAP) for human pose estimation.
  RSPose outperforms the previous state of the art on the COCO-val set and achieves an mAP score of 79.9 with ViTPose-H, a vision transformer model for human pose estimation.
  We also improve SimCC Resnet-50, a coordinate classification-based pose estimation method, by 1.5 AP on the COCO-val set, achieving 73.6 AP.

TL;DR: Proposes Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3) task to segment objects responsible for collision sounds in video frames using audio conditioning, with a weakly-supervised method using foundation models and egocentric cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can recognize object properties from interaction sounds. The task addresses challenges of collision sounds arising from object interactions in cluttered egocentric videos.

Method: Weakly-supervised audio-conditioned segmentation using foundation models (CLIP and SAM2) with egocentric cues like objects in hands to identify potential collision sound sources.

Result: Outperforms competitive baselines by 3× and 4.7× in mIoU on two new benchmarks: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Conclusion: The proposed CS3 task and method effectively segment collision sound sources in egocentric videos using audio-visual fusion and egocentric cues.

Abstract: Humans excel at multisensory perception and can often recognise object properties from the sound of their interactions. Inspired by this, we propose the novel task of Collision Sound Source Segmentation (CS3), where we aim to segment the objects responsible for a collision sound in visual input (i.e. video frames from the collision clip), conditioned on the audio. This task presents unique challenges. Unlike isolated sound events, a collision sound arises from interactions between two objects, and the acoustic signature of the collision depends on both. We focus on egocentric video, where sounds are often clear, but the visual scene is cluttered, objects are small, and interactions are brief.
  To address these challenges, we propose a weakly-supervised method for audio-conditioned segmentation, utilising foundation models (CLIP and SAM2). We also incorporate egocentric cues, i.e. objects in hands, to find acting objects that can potentially be collision sound sources. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines by $3\times$ and $4.7\times$ in mIoU on two benchmarks we introduce for the CS3 task: EPIC-CS3 and Ego4D-CS3.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Geometric Representation Regression (GRR) as an alternative to black-box Absolute Pose Regression, explicitly predicting disentangled geometric representations (ray directions and pointmaps) to recover camera pose through differentiable solving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current APR models operate as black boxes that memorize training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry, limiting generalization.

Method: Reformulates APR as inverse novel view synthesis, predicting two disentangled geometric representations: ray bundle directions for rotation and pointmaps for translation, then using differentiable solver for final pose.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization.

Conclusion: Modeling the inverse rendering process with explicit geometric representations provides a more robust path for generalizable absolute pose estimation compared to black-box regression.

Abstract: Absolute Pose Regression (APR) has emerged as a compelling paradigm for visual localization. However, APR models typically operate as black boxes, directly regressing a 6-DoF pose from a query image, which can lead to memorizing training views rather than understanding 3D scene geometry. In this work, we propose a geometrically-grounded alternative. Inspired by novel view synthesis, which renders images from intermediate geometric representations, we reformulate APR as its inverse that regresses the underlying 3D representations directly from the image, and we name this paradigm Geometric Representation Regression (GRR). Our model explicitly predicts two disentangled geometric representations in the world coordinate system: (1) a ray bundle's directions to estimate camera rotation, and (2) a corresponding pointmap to estimate camera translation. The final 6-DoF camera pose is then recovered from these geometric components using a differentiable deterministic solver. This disentangled approach, which separates the learned visual-to-geometry mapping from the final pose calculation, introduces a strong geometric prior into the network. We find that the explicit decoupling of rotation and translation predictions measurably boosts performance. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on 7-Scenes and Cambridge Landmarks datasets, validating that modeling the inverse rendering process is a more robust path toward generalizable absolute pose estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bladder cancer has high recurrence rates (up to 78%) requiring accurate monitoring. MRI interpretation is challenging due to post-surgical changes, and AI progress is hindered by lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed H-CNN-ViT model effectively addresses bladder cancer recurrence prediction with superior performance, and the released dataset and model facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Bladder cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, with a recurrence rate of up to 78%, necessitating accurate post-operative monitoring for effective patient management. Multi-sequence contrast-enhanced MRI is commonly used for recurrence detection; however, interpreting these scans remains challenging, even for experienced radiologists, due to post-surgical alterations such as scarring, swelling, and tissue remodeling. AI-assisted diagnostic tools have shown promise in improving bladder cancer recurrence prediction, yet progress in this field is hindered by the lack of dedicated multi-sequence MRI datasets for recurrence assessment study. In this work, we first introduce a curated multi-sequence, multi-modal MRI dataset specifically designed for bladder cancer recurrence prediction, establishing a valuable benchmark for future research. We then propose H-CNN-ViT, a new Hierarchical Gated Attention Multi-Branch model that enables selective weighting of features from the global (ViT) and local (CNN) paths based on contextual demands, achieving a balanced and targeted feature fusion. Our multi-branch architecture processes each modality independently, ensuring that the unique properties of each imaging channel are optimally captured and integrated. Evaluated on our dataset, H-CNN-ViT achieves an AUC of 78.6%, surpassing state-of-the-art models. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/H-CNN-ViT}.

TL;DR: QwenCLIP replaces CLIP's text encoder with an LLM-based embedding module to handle long radiology reports, improving medical image-text alignment through extended context windows and learnable prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's 77-token limit and domain-specific encoders' 512-token constraint limit representation of long, information-rich radiology reports, requiring better semantic understanding of medical text.

Method: Replace CLIP's text encoder with LLM-based embedding module (Qwen3-Embedding) and introduce learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment, leveraging LLMs' extended context windows.

Result: QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed QwenCLIP framework effectively addresses length limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in medical vision-language tasks through LLM-enhanced text representations.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has demonstrated strong generalization for vision-language tasks in computer vision and medical domains, yet its text encoder accepts only up to 77 tokens, which limits its ability to represent long and information-rich radiology reports. Recent adaptations using domain-specific encoders, such as PubMedBERT or ClinicalBERT, mitigate this issue by leveraging medical corpora, but remain constrained by their limited input length (typically 512 tokens) and relatively shallow semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we propose QwenCLIP, a vision-language framework that replaces CLIP's text encoder with a large language model (LLM)-based embedding module (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding) and introduces learnable prompts to enhance cross-modal alignment. By leveraging the extended context window and richer representations of LLMs, QwenCLIP captures comprehensive medical semantics from long-form clinical text, substantially improving medical image-text alignment and downstream performance on radiology benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional transfer learning in medical image analysis, particularly for high-dimensional DICOM images of lumbar spine degeneration, by developing a more sophisticated feature selection and representation framework.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining EfficientNet and VGG19 with custom Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer for smart feature weight variations and Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer for redundancy removal, forming a multi-tiered framework.

Result: Achieved precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and accuracy of 88.1%, significantly outperforming the baseline EfficientNet model.

Conclusion: The novel architecture successfully addresses traditional transfer learning constraints in medical imaging and contributes to automated diagnostic tools development for lumbar spine pathology classification.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new enhanced model architecture to perform classification of lumbar spine degeneration with DICOM images while using a hybrid approach, integrating EfficientNet and VGG19 together with custom-designed components. The proposed model is differentiated from traditional transfer learning methods as it incorporates a Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer along with a Sparsity-Induced Feature Reduction Layer that forms a multi-tiered framework, further improving feature selection and representation. The Pseudo-Newton Boosting layer makes smart variations of feature weights, with more detailed anatomical features, which are mostly left out in a transfer learning setup. In addition, the Sparsity-Induced Layer removes redundancy for learned features, producing lean yet robust representations for pathology in the lumbar spine. This architecture is novel as it overcomes the constraints in the traditional transfer learning approach, especially in the high-dimensional context of medical images, and achieves a significant performance boost, reaching a precision of 0.9, recall of 0.861, F1 score of 0.88, loss of 0.18, and an accuracy of 88.1%, compared to the baseline model, EfficientNet. This work will present the architectures, preprocessing pipeline, and experimental results. The results contribute to the development of automated diagnostic tools for medical images.

TL;DR: Proposes using VLMs as semantic enhancers rather than direct decision-makers in autonomous driving, achieving SOTA performance through multi-modal fusion and post-hoc refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based approaches for autonomous driving suffer from inconsistent performance and reliance on handcrafted prompts, limiting robustness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Leverages VLMs as semantic enhancers to enrich vision-based benchmarks with structured scene descriptions, then uses multi-modal fusion architecture and post-hoc refinement for decision-making.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on two autonomous driving benchmarks with improved reliability and interpretability.

Conclusion: Shifting VLMs to semantic enhancers rather than direct decision-makers offers a promising direction for reliable and interpretable autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in autonomous driving (AD) have explored the use of vision-language models (VLMs) within visual question answering (VQA) frameworks for direct driving decision-making. However, these approaches often depend on handcrafted prompts and suffer from inconsistent performance, limiting their robustness and generalization in real-world scenarios. In this work, we evaluate state-of-the-art open-source VLMs on high-level decision-making tasks using ego-view visual inputs and identify critical limitations in their ability to deliver reliable, context-aware decisions. Motivated by these observations, we propose a new approach that shifts the role of VLMs from direct decision generators to semantic enhancers. Specifically, we leverage their strong general scene understanding to enrich existing vision-based benchmarks with structured, linguistically rich scene descriptions. Building on this enriched representation, we introduce a multi-modal interactive architecture that fuses visual and linguistic features for more accurate decision-making and interpretable textual explanations. Furthermore, we design a post-hoc refinement module that utilizes VLMs to enhance prediction reliability. Extensive experiments on two autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a promising direction for integrating VLMs into reliable and interpretable AD systems.

Abstract: The population loss of trained deep neural networks often exhibits power law scaling with the size of the training dataset, guiding significant performance advancements in deep learning applications. In this study, we focus on the scaling relationship with data size in the context of medical anatomical segmentation, a domain that remains underexplored. We analyze scaling laws for anatomical segmentation across 15 semantic tasks and 4 imaging modalities, demonstrating that larger datasets significantly improve segmentation performance, following similar scaling trends. Motivated by the topological isomorphism in images sharing anatomical structures, we evaluate the impact of deformation-guided augmentation strategies on data scaling laws, specifically random elastic deformation and registration-guided deformation. We also propose a novel, scalable image augmentation approach that generates diffeomorphic mappings from geodesic subspace based on image registration to introduce realistic deformation.

TL;DR: Uni-Hema is a unified multi-task model for digital hematopathology that integrates detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases using a multimodal approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hematopathology models are limited to single tasks and cannot provide unified multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology including malignant disorders, infectious conditions, and non-malignant blood cell disorders.

Method: Built on Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at hierarchy levels for different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling, visual question answering) at different granularities, trained on 46 public datasets with over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs.

Result: Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to single-task, single-dataset models across diverse hematological tasks while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level.

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Digital hematopathology requires cell-level analysis across diverse disease categories, including malignant disorders (e.g., leukemia), infectious conditions (e.g., malaria), and non-malignant red blood cell disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease). Whether single-task, vision-language, WSI-optimized, or single-cell hematology models, these approaches share a key limitation, they cannot provide unified, multi-task, multi-modal reasoning across the complexities of digital hematopathology. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-Hema, a multi-task, unified model for digital hematopathology integrating detection, classification, segmentation, morphology prediction, and reasoning across multiple diseases. Uni-Hema leverages 46 publicly available datasets, encompassing over 700K images and 21K question-answer pairs, and is built upon Hema-Former, a multimodal module that bridges visual and textual representations at the hierarchy level for the different tasks (detection, classification, segmentation, morphology, mask language modeling and visual question answer) at different granularity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni-Hema achieves comparable or superior performance to train on a single-task and single dataset models, across diverse hematological tasks, while providing interpretable, morphologically relevant insights at the single-cell level. Our framework establishes a new standard for multi-task and multi-modal digital hematopathology. The code will be made publicly available.

*Seyed Mohamad Ali Tousi,John A. Lory,G. N. DeSouza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First weakly supervised pipeline for ephemeral gully detection using Vision Language Models to reduce manual labeling effort, with a novel teacher-student approach and a new 18,000+ image dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ephemeral gullies are difficult to detect automatically due to short temporal cycles and scarcity of labeled data, limiting machine learning approaches to zero-shot methods that are hard to implement.

Method: Uses Vision Language Models to generate noisy labels, then employs teacher-student model where teacher learns from VLM labels and student learns via weak supervision with noise-aware loss function.

Result: Experimental results show superior performance compared to VLMs and label model alone when using weak supervision to train student model.

Conclusion: The approach successfully overcomes challenges in ephemeral gully detection by reducing manual labeling effort through weak supervision and VLM integration, with publicly available code and dataset.

Abstract: Among soil erosion problems, Ephemeral Gullies are one of the most concerning phenomena occurring in agricultural fields. Their short temporal cycles increase the difficulty in automatically detecting them using classical computer vision approaches and remote sensing. Also, due to scarcity of and the difficulty in producing accurate labeled data, automatic detection of ephemeral gullies using Machine Learning is limited to zero-shot approaches which are hard to implement. To overcome these challenges, we present the first weakly supervised pipeline for detection of ephemeral gullies. Our method relies on remote sensing and uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to drastically reduce the labor-intensive task of manual labeling. In order to achieve that, the method exploits: 1) the knowledge embedded in the VLM's pretraining; 2) a teacher-student model where the teacher learns from noisy labels coming from the VLMs, and the student learns by weak supervision using teacher-generate labels and a noise-aware loss function. We also make available the first-of-its-kind dataset for semi-supervised detection of ephemeral gully from remote-sensed images. The dataset consists of a number of locations labeled by a group of soil and plant scientists, as well as a large number of unlabeled locations. The dataset represent more than 18,000 high-resolution remote-sensing images obtained over the course of 13 years. Our experimental results demonstrate the validity of our approach by showing superior performances compared to VLMs and the label model itself when using weak supervision to train an student model. The code and dataset for this work are made publicly available.

### [66] [Temporal Realism Evaluation of Generated Videos Using Compressed-Domain Motion Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13897)
*Mert Onur Cakiroglu,Idil Bilge Altun,Zhihe Lu,Mehmet Dalkilic,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using motion vectors from compressed video to evaluate and improve temporal realism in generative video models, revealing motion defects and enhancing classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack temporal realism, and existing metrics focus mainly on spatial quality, not motion dynamics.

Method: Extract motion vectors from compressed video streams (H.264/HEVC), compute statistical divergences between real and generated videos, and explore MV-RGB fusion methods for classification.

Result: Identified systematic motion discrepancies in generative videos, with Pika and SVD closest to real motion. MV-RGB fusion improved classification accuracy up to 99.0% for real-vs-generated discrimination.

Conclusion: Motion vectors from compressed video provide effective temporal signals for evaluating generative video quality and enhancing temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

Abstract: Temporal realism remains a central weakness of current generative video models, as most evaluation metrics prioritize spatial appearance and offer limited sensitivity to motion. We introduce a scalable, model-agnostic framework that assesses temporal behavior using motion vectors (MVs) extracted directly from compressed video streams. Codec-generated MVs from standards such as H.264 and HEVC provide lightweight, resolution-consistent descriptors of motion dynamics. We quantify realism by computing Kullback-Leibler, Jensen-Shannon, and Wasserstein divergences between MV statistics of real and generated videos. Experiments on the GenVidBench dataset containing videos from eight state-of-the-art generators reveal systematic discrepancies from real motion: entropy-based divergences rank Pika and SVD as closest to real videos, MV-sum statistics favor VC2 and Text2Video-Zero, and CogVideo shows the largest deviations across both measures. Visualizations of MV fields and class-conditional motion heatmaps further reveal center bias, sparse and piecewise constant flows, and grid-like artifacts that frame-level metrics do not capture. Beyond evaluation, we investigate MV-RGB fusion through channel concatenation, cross-attention, joint embedding, and a motion-aware fusion module. Incorporating MVs improves downstream classification across ResNet, I3D, and TSN backbones, with ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 reaching up to 97.4% accuracy and I3D achieving 99.0% accuracy on real-versus-generated discrimination. These findings demonstrate that compressed-domain MVs provide an effective temporal signal for diagnosing motion defects in generative videos and for strengthening temporal reasoning in discriminative models.

TL;DR: SAE-MCVT is the first scalable real-time Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking framework that addresses the gap between accuracy and practical deployment needs in city-scale ITS applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCVT studies focus on accuracy but overlook real-time performance and scalability, which are crucial for real-world deployment in growing camera networks.

Method: Uses edge devices for local processing (object detection, tracking, geo-mapping, feature extraction) and transmits only lightweight metadata to a central workstation for cross-camera association using self-supervised camera link model with spatial-temporal constraints.

Result: Achieves real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams with 61.2 IDF1 score on RoundaboutHD dataset.

Conclusion: SAE-MCVT is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment, balancing accuracy with practical performance requirements.

Abstract: In modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), cameras are a key component due to their ability to provide valuable information for multiple stakeholders. A central task is Multi-Camera Vehicle Tracking (MCVT), which generates vehicle trajectories and enables applications such as anomaly detection, traffic density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, most existing studies on MCVT emphasize accuracy while overlooking real-time performance and scalability. These two aspects are essential for real-world deployment and become increasingly challenging in city-scale applications as the number of cameras grows. To address this issue, we propose SAE-MCVT, the first scalable real-time MCVT framework. The system includes several edge devices that interact with one central workstation separately. On the edge side, live RTSP video streams are serialized and processed through modules including object detection, object tracking, geo-mapping, and feature extraction. Only lightweight metadata -- vehicle locations and deep appearance features -- are transmitted to the central workstation. On the central side, cross-camera association is calculated under the constraint of spatial-temporal relations between adjacent cameras, which are learned through a self-supervised camera link model. Experiments on the RoundaboutHD dataset show that SAE-MCVT maintains real-time operation on 2K 15 FPS video streams and achieves an IDF1 score of 61.2. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable real-time MCVT framework suitable for city-scale deployment.

We curate a pilot dataset of images depicting traffic signs and road-safety norms sourced from school text books and use it to evaluate models capabilities in a zero-shot setting. Our preliminary results show that these models struggle with safety reasoning and reveal gaps between human learning and model interpretation. We further provide an analysis of these performance gaps for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks when CoT outputs become lengthy or complex, and increased dataset size doesn't always enhance performance due to varying data complexities.

Method: Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO) leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples.

Result: CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods including Visual-RFT, with improvements up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO, and shows exceptional efficiency and robustness in few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: CuRPO effectively addresses the limitations of RL-based CoT reasoning in visual grounding by using curriculum learning based on complexity indicators, delivering strong performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently shown significant promise across various NLP and computer vision tasks by explicitly generating intermediate reasoning steps. However, we find that reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuned CoT reasoning can paradoxically degrade performance in Visual Grounding tasks, particularly as CoT outputs become lengthy or complex. Additionally, our analysis reveals that increased dataset size does not always enhance performance due to varying data complexities. Motivated by these findings, we propose Curriculum-based Relative Policy Optimization (CuRPO), a novel training strategy that leverages CoT length and generalized Intersection over Union (gIoU) rewards as complexity indicators to progressively structure training data from simpler to more challenging examples. Extensive experiments on RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and LISA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. CuRPO consistently outperforms existing methods, including Visual-RFT, with notable improvements of up to +12.52 mAP on RefCOCO. Moreover, CuRPO exhibits exceptional efficiency and robustness, delivering strong localization performance even in few-shot learning scenarios, particularly benefiting tasks characterized by ambiguous and intricate textual descriptions.The code is released on https://github.com/qyoung-yan/CuRPO.

TL;DR: Pretraining vision transformers on procedurally-generated data (non-visual, non-semantic) improves data efficiency and performance when followed by standard image training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To instill generic inductive biases in vision transformers that are beneficial across modalities, using data devoid of visual or semantic content.

Method: Generate procedurally-generated data using simple algorithms like formal grammars, pretrain ViTs on this data while bypassing visual patch embeddings, then follow with standard image-based training.

Result: 1% procedural data pretraining improves ImageNet-1k accuracy by over 1.7%, equivalent to 28% of ImageNet-1k data in terms of performance effect.

Conclusion: Procedural data pretraining offers a promising path toward data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies for vision transformers.

Abstract: Transformers show remarkable versatility across domains, suggesting the existence of inductive biases beneficial across modalities. In this work, we explore a new way to instil such generic biases in vision transformers (ViTs) by pretraining on procedurally-generated data devoid of visual or semantic content. We generate this data with simple algorithms such as formal grammars, so the results bear no relationship to either natural or synthetic images. We use this procedurally-generated data to pretrain ViTs in a warm-up phase that bypasses their visual patch embedding mechanisms, thus encouraging the models to internalise abstract computational priors. When followed by standard image-based training, this warm-up significantly improves data efficiency, convergence speed, and downstream performance. On ImageNet-1k for example, allocating just 1% of the training budget to procedural data improves final accuracy by over 1.7%. In terms of its effect on performance, 1% procedurally generated data is thus equivalent to 28% of the ImageNet-1k data. These findings suggest a promising path toward new data-efficient and domain-agnostic pretraining strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create robust cell instance segmentation by learning continuous scalar fields that can handle outliers in training data while providing sharp cell boundaries, with implementation simplicity and efficiency for edge computing applications.

Method: Train a U-Net to learn continuous scalar fields (solutions to Poisson PDE and heat equation diffusion) on image domains. Segmentation is performed using watershed method on these learned fields. Only field residuals are minimized during training without regularization.

Result: Competitive results on public datasets showing excellent cell segmentation performance. The method provides robust instance segmentation capable of diminishing adverse impacts of outliers while maintaining sharp cell boundaries.

Conclusion: The proposed simple yet geometrically insightful approach using scalar fields achieves excellent cell segmentation with implementation simplicity, lower training/inference times, reduced energy consumption, and small memory footprint - making it suitable for edge computing.

Abstract: We investigate image segmentation of cells under the lens of scalar fields. Our goal is to learn a continuous scalar field on image domains such that its segmentation produces robust instances for cells present in images. This field is a function parameterized by the trained network, and its segmentation is realized by the watershed method. The fields we experiment with are solutions to the Poisson partial differential equation and a diffusion mimicking the steady-state solution of the heat equation. These solutions are obtained by minimizing just the field residuals, no regularization is needed, providing a robust regression capable of diminishing the adverse impacts of outliers in the training data and allowing for sharp cell boundaries. A single tensor is all that is needed to train a \unet\ thus simplifying implementation, lowering training and inference times, hence reducing energy consumption, and requiring a small memory footprint, all attractive features in edge computing. We present competitive results on public datasets from the literature and show that our novel, simple yet geometrically insightful approach can achieve excellent cell segmentation results.

Motivation: Current skill assessment models are specialized for individual sports and suffer from high costs and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports.

Method: Discovers universal skill-attributes (balance, control, hand positioning) across sports, then trains a multimodal language model to generate feedback and proficiency levels for novel videos.

Result: Achieves up to 60% relative gains over state-of-the-art in both cross-sport transfer and intra-sport settings across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: By abstracting shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the video representation generalizes better than existing techniques and enriches multimodal large language models.

Abstract: Skill assessment from video entails rating the quality of a person's physical performance and explaining what could be done better. Today's models specialize for an individual sport, and suffer from the high cost and scarcity of expert-level supervision across the long tail of sports. Towards closing that gap, we explore transferable video representations for skill assessment. Our CrossTrainer approach discovers skill-attributes, such as balance, control, and hand positioning -- whose meaning transcends the boundaries of any given sport, then trains a multimodal language model to generate actionable feedback for a novel video, e.g., "lift hands more to generate more power" as well as its proficiency level, e.g., early expert. We validate the new model on multiple datasets for both cross-sport (transfer) and intra-sport (in-domain) settings, where it achieves gains up to 60% relative to the state of the art. By abstracting out the shared behaviors indicative of human skill, the proposed video representation generalizes substantially better than an array of existing techniques, enriching today's multimodal large language models.

TL;DR: A dual-prompt expert network with convolutional dictionary feature decoupling for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution, addressing contrast disparities to better integrate reference image textures for improved reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-contrast MRI super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-resolution images using reference images with different contrasts, but contrast disparities between modalities make it challenging to effectively utilize reference textures, often leading to suboptimal feature integration.

Method: Proposes CD-DPE strategy with iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, and dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) using frequency prompt for reference feature selection and adaptive routing prompt for optimal fusion.

Result: Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets show CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on unseen datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed CD-DPE framework effectively addresses contrast disparities in multi-contrast MRI super-resolution, achieving superior reconstruction quality and generalization performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) super-resolution intends to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) scans by leveraging structural information present in HR reference images acquired with different contrasts. This technique enhances anatomical detail and soft tissue differentiation, which is vital for early diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, inherent contrasts disparities between modalities pose fundamental challenges in effectively utilizing reference image textures to guide target image reconstruction, often resulting in suboptimal feature integration. To address this issue, we propose a dual-prompt expert network based on a convolutional dictionary feature decoupling (CD-DPE) strategy for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce an iterative convolutional dictionary feature decoupling module (CD-FDM) to separate features into cross-contrast and intra-contrast components, thereby reducing redundancy and interference. To fully integrate these features, a novel dual-prompt feature fusion expert module (DP-FFEM) is proposed. This module uses a frequency prompt to guide the selection of relevant reference features for incorporation into the target image, while an adaptive routing prompt determines the optimal method for fusing reference and target features to enhance reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MRI datasets demonstrate that CD-DPE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing fine details. Additionally, experiments on unseen datasets demonstrated that CD-DPE exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE is a benchmark and system for indoor scene understanding using single static mmWave radar, achieving layout reconstruction and object detection while preserving privacy through multipath reflection analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns and occlusion limitations of optical sensors (RGB/LiDAR) in indoor environments by leveraging mmWave radar's privacy-preserving nature and obstacle penetration capabilities, despite its low spatial resolution.

Method: Uses Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement to model Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure for recovering secondary reflections, combined with a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework to transform fragmented radar responses into complete scene understanding.

Result: Reduces Chamfer Distance by 60% (to 16 cm) in layout reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art, and achieves 58% IoU in mmWave-based object detection - the first such system for object detection using mmWave radar.

Conclusion: RISE establishes a new foundation for geometry-aware, privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using single static radar, demonstrating that multipath reflections can be leveraged as valuable geometric cues rather than treated as noise.

Abstract: Robust and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental open problem. While optical sensors such as RGB and LiDAR offer high spatial fidelity, they suffer from severe occlusions and introduce privacy risks in indoor environments. In contrast, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar preserves privacy and penetrates obstacles, but its inherently low spatial resolution makes reliable geometric reasoning difficult.
  We introduce RISE, the first benchmark and system for single-static-radar indoor scene understanding, jointly targeting layout reconstruction and object detection. RISE is built upon the key insight that multipath reflections, traditionally treated as noise, encode rich geometric cues. To exploit this, we propose a Bi-Angular Multipath Enhancement that explicitly models Angle-of-Arrival and Angle-of-Departure to recover secondary (ghost) reflections and reveal invisible structures. On top of these enhanced observations, a simulation-to-reality Hierarchical Diffusion framework transforms fragmented radar responses into complete layout reconstruction and object detection.
  Our benchmark contains 50,000 frames collected across 100 real indoor trajectories, forming the first large-scale dataset dedicated to radar-based indoor scene understanding. Extensive experiments show that RISE reduces the Chamfer Distance by 60% (down to 16 cm) compared to the state of the art in layout reconstruction, and delivers the first mmWave-based object detection, achieving 58% IoU. These results establish RISE as a new foundation for geometry-aware and privacy-preserving indoor scene understanding using a single static radar.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 2.5D context-aware model for MRI plane orientation classification achieves 99.49% accuracy, reducing errors by 60% compared to 2D methods, and improves brain tumor detection accuracy by 1% when used with uncertainty-based metadata enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated systems struggle with identifying anatomical planes in MRI slices, and missing plane orientation metadata complicates analysis, increases domain shift in heterogeneous datasets, and reduces diagnostic classifier accuracy.

Method: Developed a 2.5D context-aware classifier that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices. Trained on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images, with a gated strategy that selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores.

Result: 2.5D model achieved 99.49% accuracy (vs 98.74% for 2D reference), reducing errors by 60%. In brain tumor detection, metadata enhancement boosted accuracy from 97.0% to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%.

Conclusion: 2.5D context is crucial for robust plane orientation classification, and the generated metadata significantly improves downstream diagnostic tasks. The model is integrated into an open-source web application.

Abstract: Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%. We integrate our plane orientation model into an interactive web application and provide it open-source.

*Md Shazid Islam,Shreyangshu Bera,Sudipta Paul,Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LINGUAL is a framework that uses natural language instructions to automate medical image segmentation, reducing annotation effort by ~80% while achieving comparable or better performance than active learning baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning in medical image segmentation is challenging due to blurry boundaries and high cognitive demands. Language guidance offers a less labor-intensive alternative to precise boundary delineation.

Method: LINGUAL receives natural language instructions from experts, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs corresponding sub-tasks without human intervention.

Result: The framework achieves comparable or superior performance to active learning baselines in active domain adaptation while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

Conclusion: Language-guided frameworks like LINGUAL provide an effective alternative to traditional active learning, significantly reducing expert annotation effort while maintaining or improving segmentation performance.

Abstract: Although active learning (AL) in segmentation tasks enables experts to annotate selected regions of interest (ROIs) instead of entire images, it remains highly challenging, labor-intensive, and cognitively demanding due to the blurry and ambiguous boundaries commonly observed in medical images. Also, in conventional AL, annotation effort is a function of the ROI- larger regions make the task cognitively easier but incur higher annotation costs, whereas smaller regions demand finer precision and more attention from the expert. In this context, language guidance provides an effective alternative, requiring minimal expert effort while bypassing the cognitively demanding task of precise boundary delineation in segmentation. Towards this goal, we introduce LINGUAL: a framework that receives natural language instructions from an expert, translates them into executable programs through in-context learning, and automatically performs the corresponding sequence of sub-tasks without any human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LINGUAL in active domain adaptation (ADA) achieving comparable or superior performance to AL baselines while reducing estimated annotation time by approximately 80%.

*Sungik Choi,Hankook Lee,Moontae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaRPAD is a training-free AI-generated image detection method that uses self-supervised models' sensitivity to resizing operations to distinguish real from AI-generated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detectors require training on specific datasets, but WaRPAD aims for a training-free approach that doesn't need prior data knowledge by leveraging self-supervised models' inherent properties.

Method: Uses self-supervised models pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop. Defines a base score function measuring sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions (via Haar wavelet). Rescales images to multiples of model input size, divides into patches, computes base score for each patch, and averages scores.

Result: Validated on real datasets of diverse resolutions/domains and images from 23 generative models. Consistently achieves competitive performance with strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Works across different self-supervised models.

Conclusion: WaRPAD provides an effective training-free detection method that leverages self-supervised models' invariance to cropping augmentation, demonstrating broad applicability and robustness across diverse image sources and generative models.

Abstract: AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.

TL;DR: FashionMAC is a diffusion-based framework for garment-centric fashion image generation that preserves garment details without deformation and enables fine-grained control over model appearance using region-adaptive attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from garment texture distortions due to deformation requirements and lack fine-grained controllability over model appearance, limiting practical applications in e-commerce.

Method: Proposes a deformation-free framework that directly outpaints garments segmented from dressed persons, combined with region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) and chained mask injection for fine-grained attribute control.

Result: Extensive experiments show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving high-quality fashion showcase images with preserved garment details and enhanced controllability.

Conclusion: FashionMAC effectively addresses key challenges in garment-centric fashion generation by eliminating deformation-induced distortions and enabling precise control over model appearance through innovative attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional physics-based flood models are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time applications, while existing neural network approaches suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas.

Method: Proposed approach leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, incorporating physics-informed inputs to enhance interpretability and using transfer learning for geographic adaptation.

Result: Latent diffusion models substantially decrease computational time for high-fidelity flood maps without compromising accuracy, enabling real-time flood risk management with superior cross-location generalizability.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the gap between computational efficiency and accuracy in flood prediction, making high-resolution flood mapping practical for real-time emergency response while maintaining interpretability through physics-informed modeling.

Abstract: Flood prediction is critical for emergency planning and response to mitigate human and economic losses. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic models generate high-resolution flood maps using numerical methods requiring fine-grid discretization; which are computationally intensive and impractical for real-time large-scale applications. While recent studies have applied convolutional neural networks for flood map super-resolution with good accuracy and speed, they suffer from limited generalizability to unseen areas. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models to perform super-resolution on coarse-grid flood maps, with the objective of achieving the accuracy of fine-grid flood maps while significantly reducing inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that latent diffusion models substantially decrease the computational time required to produce high-fidelity flood maps without compromising on accuracy, enabling their use in real-time flood risk management. Moreover, diffusion models exhibit superior generalizability across different physical locations, with transfer learning further accelerating adaptation to new geographic regions. Our approach also incorporates physics-informed inputs, addressing the common limitation of black-box behavior in machine learning, thereby enhancing interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly object detection and classification are challenging tasks in computer vision, particularly for bridge inspection where manual methods are inefficient and potentially dangerous.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Saliency-based defect region proposals using local discontinuities in surface patterns, 2) YOLOX-based deep learning detector with saliency-enhanced images using bounding-box level brightness augmentation.

Result: Experimental results on standard datasets confirm good performance in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential for implementation in self-powered inspection systems due to its accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Anomaly object detection and classification are one of the main challenging tasks in computer vision and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a new method to automatically detect, localize and classify defects in concrete bridge structures using drone imagery. This framework is constituted of two main stages. The first stage uses saliency for defect region proposals where defects often exhibit local discontinuities in the normal surface patterns with regard to their surrounding. The second stage employs a YOLOX-based deep learning detector that operates on saliency-enhanced images obtained by applying bounding-box level brightness augmentation to salient defect regions. Experimental results on standard datasets confirm the performance of our framework and its suitability in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, which give a huge potential to be implemented in a self-powered inspection system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAR is a semantic-context-driven method for autoregressive image editing that uses compressed semantic prefilling and semantic alignment guidance to improve instruction adherence and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models show promise for image generation but struggle with general image editing due to weak conditioning, poor instruction adherence, and visual artifacts.

Method: Introduces Compressed Semantic Prefilling (encoding high-level semantics into compact prefix) and Semantic Alignment Guidance (aligning visual hidden states with target semantics during decoding).

Result: Achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods.

Conclusion: SCAR effectively addresses conditioning limitations in AR models for image editing while maintaining controllability and generalizing across AR paradigms.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) models have shown strong potential in image generation, offering better scalability and easier integration with unified multi-modal systems compared to diffusion-based methods. However, extending AR models to general image editing remains challenging due to weak and inefficient conditioning, often leading to poor instruction adherence and visual artifacts. To address this, we propose SCAR, a Semantic-Context-driven method for Autoregressive models. SCAR introduces two key components: Compressed Semantic Prefilling, which encodes high-level semantics into a compact and efficient prefix, and Semantic Alignment Guidance, which aligns the last visual hidden states with target semantics during autoregressive decoding to enhance instruction fidelity. Unlike decoding-stage injection methods, SCAR builds upon the flexibility and generality of vector-quantized-based prefilling while overcoming its semantic limitations and high cost. It generalizes across both next-token and next-set AR paradigms with minimal architectural changes. SCAR achieves superior visual fidelity and semantic alignment on both instruction editing and controllable generation benchmarks, outperforming prior AR-based methods while maintaining controllability. All code will be released.

TL;DR: CORE introduces object-centric visual token compression for LVLMs using segmentation masks to guide token merging, achieving state-of-the-art performance with extreme efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory costs from quadratic visual token growth in LVLMs, overcoming limitations of existing methods that lack semantic understanding and cause suboptimal merges.

Method: Uses efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks as semantic prior for merging tokens into compact object-centric representations, with centroid-guided sorting to restore spatial order.

Result: Achieves SOTA on six benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive settings, and maintains 97.4% baseline performance with only 2.2% visual tokens.

Conclusion: Object-centric representations are superior for efficient and effective LVLM processing, demonstrating CORE's effectiveness in extreme compression scenarios.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) usually suffer from prohibitive computational and memory costs due to the quadratic growth of visual tokens with image resolution. Existing token compression methods, while varied, often lack a high-level semantic understanding, leading to suboptimal merges, information redundancy, or context loss. To address these limitations, we introduce CORE (Compact Object-centric REpresentations), a new paradigm for visual token compression. CORE leverages an efficient segmentation decoder to generate object masks, which serve as a high-level semantic prior to guide the merging of visual tokens into a compact set of object-centric representations. Furthermore, a novel centroid-guided sorting mechanism restores a coherent spatial order to the merged tokens, preserving vital positional information. Extensive experiments show that CORE not only establishes a new state-of-the-art on six authoritative benchmarks for fixed-rate compression, but also achieves dramatic efficiency gains in adaptive-rate settings. Even under extreme compression, after aggressively retaining with only 2.2% of all visual tokens, CORE still maintains 97.4% of baseline performance. Our work demonstrates the superiority of object-centric representations for efficient and effective LVLM processing.

TL;DR: Proposes Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS) using Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS) to directly generate classifier parameters from minimal task information (1-shot image + text), eliminating the need for training and achieving state-of-the-art performance on few-shot medical image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the dependency on large-scale annotated datasets in medical AI, especially for rare diseases where data is scarce and expert annotation is expensive.

Method: Leverages pre-trained generative engine to synthesize entire classifier parameters from minimal multi-modal inputs (single image + clinical text description), generating weights for lightweight classifiers like EfficientNet-V2 without any training.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art on ISIC 2018 skin lesion and custom rare disease datasets, significantly outperforming few-shot and zero-shot methods in 1-shot and 5-shot regimes.

Conclusion: Enables rapid development of AI diagnostic tools for rare diseases with limited data, eliminating traditional training requirements.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on "big data" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.
  The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.

TL;DR: A fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on 3D CT scans using segmentation, landmark detection, and geometric fitting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual and semi-automated methods for measuring glenoid bone loss are time-consuming and subject to interreader variability, creating a need for more reliable and efficient automated solutions.

Method: Multi-stage deep learning pipeline with: (1) U-Net for glenoid and humerus segmentation, (2) network for glenoid rim point detection, (3) PCA, projection, and circle fitting for geometric bone loss calculation.

Result: Automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings (ICC 0.84 vs surgeon ICC 0.78), better performance in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups, and effective classification into severity categories with no severe misclassifications.

Conclusion: The method provides a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

Abstract: Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss.

TL;DR: DEER-3D is an error-driven framework that uses targeted 3D scene editing to generate precise counterfactuals for improving 3D-LLM grounding accuracy through iterative fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D-LLMs have limited accuracy in grounding language to visual and spatial elements due to training data biases and scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved.

Method: Proposes 3D scene editing to generate visual counterfactuals and introduces DEER-3D framework with "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow that diagnoses predicate-level errors and executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits for targeted counterfactual supervision.

Result: Consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks through iterative refinement, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy.

Conclusion: Targeted, error-driven scene editing effectively bridges linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured "Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U-Net struggles with long-range dependencies, while transformer variants require heavy computation and large datasets. There's a need for efficient networks that capture global context without computational burden.

Method: Proposes GCA-ResUNet that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations with minimal parameter and FLOP overhead.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 86.11% on Synapse dataset and 92.64% on ACDC dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GCA provides a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.

*Fan Zhang,Haoyuan Ren,Fei Ma,Qiang Yin,Yongsheng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMGeo is a promptable end-to-end transformer model for cross-view object geo-localization that achieves state-of-the-art performance by using a Swin-Transformer encoder with grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts and anchor-free detection head.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-stage 'retrieval-matching' pipelines for cross-view object geo-localization suffer from cumulative errors due to significant viewpoint and scale differences, and complex background interference between drone and satellite imagery.

Method: Uses fully transformer-based architecture with Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding, grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) to capture inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, and anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression via heat-map supervision.

Result: Achieves leading performance on drone-to-satellite task: 87.51% accuracy at IoU=0.25, 62.50% mIoU, and 61.45% in test set, significantly outperforming DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, 54.05%).

Conclusion: SMGeo demonstrates superior geo-localization performance through its end-to-end transformer architecture, with complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

Abstract: Cross-view object Geo-localization aims to precisely pinpoint the same object across large-scale satellite imagery based on drone images. Due to significant differences in viewpoint and scale, coupled with complex background interference, traditional multi-stage "retrieval-matching" pipelines are prone to cumulative errors. To address this, we present SMGeo, a promptable end-to-end transformer-based model for object Geo-localization. This model supports click prompting and can output object Geo-localization in real time when prompted to allow for interactive use. The model employs a fully transformer-based architecture, utilizing a Swin-Transformer for joint feature encoding of both drone and satellite imagery and an anchor-free transformer detection head for coordinate regression. In order to better capture both inter-modal and intra-view dependencies, we introduce a grid-level sparse Mixture-of-Experts (GMoE) into the cross-view encoder, allowing it to adaptively activate specialized experts according to the content, scale and source of each grid. We also employ an anchor-free detection head for coordinate regression, directly predicting object locations via heat-map supervision in the reference images. This approach avoids scale bias and matching complexity introduced by predefined anchor boxes. On the drone-to-satellite task, SMGeo achieves leading performance in accuracy at IoU=0.25 and mIoU metrics (e.g., 87.51%, 62.50%, and 61.45% in the test set, respectively), significantly outperforming representative methods such as DetGeo (61.97%, 57.66%, and 54.05%, respectively). Ablation studies demonstrate complementary gains from shared encoding, query-guided fusion, and grid-level sparse mixture-of-experts.

### [90] [BCE3S: Binary Cross-Entropy Based Tripartite Synergistic Learning for Long-tailed Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14097)
*Weijia Fan,Qiufu Li,Jiajun Wen,Xiaoyang Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BCE3S, a tripartite synergistic learning framework using binary cross-entropy for long-tailed recognition, achieving better feature compactness, separability, and balanced classifier vectors than CE-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CE-based LTR methods struggle with feature learning and amplify imbalance effects due to coupled imbalanced classifier vectors in Softmax denominator. Need for better intra-class compactness, inter-class separability, and balanced classifier separability.

Method: Three-component BCE-based approach: (1) BCE joint learning for feature and classifier optimization via multiple Sigmoid, (2) BCE contrastive learning for intra-class compactness, (3) BCE uniform learning for balanced classifier separability.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance on CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018. Higher feature compactness and separability, balanced classifier separability compared to CE-based methods.

Conclusion: BCE3S framework effectively addresses LTR challenges by decoupling imbalanced classifier metrics, synergistically improving feature properties and classifier balance, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: For long-tailed recognition (LTR) tasks, high intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in both head and tail classes, as well as balanced separability among all the classifier vectors, are preferred. The existing LTR methods based on cross-entropy (CE) loss not only struggle to learn features with desirable properties but also couple imbalanced classifier vectors in the denominator of its Softmax, amplifying the imbalance effects in LTR. In this paper, for the LTR, we propose a binary cross-entropy (BCE)-based tripartite synergistic learning, termed BCE3S, which consists of three components: (1) BCE-based joint learning optimizes both the classifier and sample features, which achieves better compactness and separability among features than the CE-based joint learning, by decoupling the metrics between feature and the imbalanced classifier vectors in multiple Sigmoid; (2) BCE-based contrastive learning further improves the intra-class compactness of features; (3) BCE-based uniform learning balances the separability among classifier vectors and interactively enhances the feature properties by combining with the joint learning. The extensive experiments show that the LTR model trained by BCE3S not only achieves higher compactness and separability among sample features, but also balances the classifier's separability, achieving SOTA performance on various long-tailed datasets such as CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIO-IR methods rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making them hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations.

Method: Uses frozen MLLM as planner to analyze images and generate frequency-aware restoration plans, then employs LoRA-MoE diffusion executor with dynamic expert selection based on frequency features, plus adversarial training and frequency regularization loss.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

Conclusion: FAPE-IR provides a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration by coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration.

Abstract: All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.

### [92] [Text-Driven Reasoning Video Editing via Reinforcement Learning on Digital Twin Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14100)
*Yiqing Shen,Chenjia Li,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RIVER is a reasoning-based video editing model that interprets implicit text queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets, then executes modifications using a diffusion-based editor guided by structured instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video editing methods require explicit descriptions with precise spatial and temporal specifications, which are impractical when users want to make edits based on implicit queries about semantic properties or object relationships.

Method: RIVER decouples reasoning from generation using digital twin representations of video content. A large language model performs multi-hop reasoning on these representations with implicit queries to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions for a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. Training uses reinforcement learning with rewards for reasoning accuracy and generation quality.

Result: RIVER achieves best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark (100 videos with 519 implicit queries) and state-of-the-art performance on two additional benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), surpassing six baseline methods.

Conclusion: RIVER successfully addresses the challenge of reasoning video editing by interpreting implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning, demonstrating superior performance across multiple benchmarks and enabling more intuitive video editing through semantic understanding rather than explicit specifications.

Abstract: Text-driven video editing enables users to modify video content only using text queries. While existing methods can modify video content if explicit descriptions of editing targets with precise spatial locations and temporal boundaries are provided, these requirements become impractical when users attempt to conceptualize edits through implicit queries referencing semantic properties or object relationships. We introduce reasoning video editing, a task where video editing models must interpret implicit queries through multi-hop reasoning to infer editing targets before executing modifications, and a first model attempting to solve this complex task, RIVER (Reasoning-based Implicit Video Editor). RIVER decouples reasoning from generation through digital twin representations of video content that preserve spatial relationships, temporal trajectories, and semantic attributes. A large language model then processes this representation jointly with the implicit query, performing multi-hop reasoning to determine modifications, then outputs structured instructions that guide a diffusion-based editor to execute pixel-level changes. RIVER training uses reinforcement learning with rewards that evaluate reasoning accuracy and generation quality. Finally, we introduce RVEBenchmark, a benchmark of 100 videos with 519 implicit queries spanning three levels and categories of reasoning complexity specifically for reasoning video editing. RIVER demonstrates best performance on the proposed RVEBenchmark and also achieves state-of-the-art performance on two additional video editing benchmarks (VegGIE and FiVE), where it surpasses six baseline methods.

Motivation: Existing monocular depth estimation models consume too many computing resources, and while some lightweight methods exist, they suffer from performance degradation, hindering real-world deployment for autonomous driving and robot navigation.

Method: Proposed RTS-Mono with lightweight encoder-decoder architecture using Lite-Encoder and multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy while maintaining performance and improving inference speed.

Conclusion: RTS-Mono successfully addresses the trade-off between model efficiency and performance, enabling practical real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation for autonomous systems.

Abstract: Depth information is crucial for autonomous driving and intelligent robot navigation. The simplicity and flexibility of self-supervised monocular depth estimation are conducive to its role in these fields. However, most existing monocular depth estimation models consume many computing resources. Although some methods have reduced the model's size and improved computing efficiency, the performance deteriorates, seriously hindering the real-world deployment of self-supervised monocular depth estimation models in the real world. To address this problem, we proposed a real-time self-supervised monocular depth estimation method and implemented it in the real world. It is called RTS-Mono, which is a lightweight and efficient encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder is based on Lite-Encoder, and the decoder is designed with a multi-scale sparse fusion framework to minimize redundancy, ensure performance, and improve inference speed. RTS-Mono achieved state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance in high and low resolutions with extremely low parameter counts (3 M) in experiments based on the KITTI dataset. Compared with lightweight methods, RTS-Mono improved Abs Rel and Sq Rel by 5.6% and 9.8% at low resolution and improved Sq Rel and RMSE by 6.1% and 1.9% at high resolution. In real-world deployment experiments, RTS-Mono has extremely high accuracy and can perform real-time inference on Nvidia Jetson Orin at a speed of 49 FPS.

TL;DR: Proposes A²GC-VPR, an asymmetric aggregation method for visual place recognition that addresses distributional discrepancies between image features and cluster centers using separate marginal calibration and geometric constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard optimal transport methods treat source and target marginals symmetrically, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers have substantially different distributions in visual place recognition.

Method: Uses row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration for asymmetric matching, and incorporates geometric constraints through learnable coordinate embeddings fused with feature similarities.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets, showing improved matching accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The asymmetric aggregation approach with geometric constraints effectively handles distributional discrepancies and enhances spatial awareness in visual place recognition, leading to better performance.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) aims to match query images against a database using visual cues. State-of-the-art methods aggregate features from deep backbones to form global descriptors. Optimal transport-based aggregation methods reformulate feature-to-cluster assignment as a transport problem, but the standard Sinkhorn algorithm symmetrically treats source and target marginals, limiting effectiveness when image features and cluster centers exhibit substantially different distributions. We propose an asymmetric aggregation VPR method with geometric constraints for locally aggregated descriptors, called $A^2$GC-VPR. Our method employs row-column normalization averaging with separate marginal calibration, enabling asymmetric matching that adapts to distributional discrepancies in visual place recognition. Geometric constraints are incorporated through learnable coordinate embeddings, computing compatibility scores fused with feature similarities, thereby promoting spatially proximal features to the same cluster and enhancing spatial awareness. Experimental results on MSLS, NordLand, and Pittsburgh datasets demonstrate superior performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}.

TL;DR: Coffee is a method that uses language to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from learning undesired concepts during fine-tuning, requiring no additional training and enabling flexible concept modification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fine-tuning methods for text-to-image models can learn unwanted concepts from training data and entangle them with user prompts, which is problematic for bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and diffusion policy fine-tuning.

Method: Coffee regularizes the adaptation process by keeping user prompt embeddings from aligning with undesired concepts specified through textual descriptions, without requiring additional training.

Result: Experimental results show Coffee effectively prevents text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Coffee provides an effective solution for controllable fine-tuning of text-to-image diffusion models by using language to specify and prevent learning of undesired concepts.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate diverse content with flexible prompts, which makes them well-suited for customization through fine-tuning with a small amount of user-provided data. However, controllable fine-tuning that prevents models from learning undesired concepts present in the fine-tuning data, and from entangling those concepts with user prompts, remains an open challenge. It is crucial for downstream tasks like bias mitigation, preventing malicious adaptation, attribute disentanglement, and generalizable fine-tuning of diffusion policy. We propose Coffee that allows using language to specify undesired concepts to regularize the adaptation process. The crux of our method lies in keeping the embeddings of the user prompt from aligning with undesired concepts. Crucially, Coffee requires no additional training and enables flexible modification of undesired concepts by modifying textual descriptions. We evaluate Coffee by fine-tuning on images associated with user prompts paired with undesired concepts. Experimental results demonstrate that Coffee can prevent text-to-image models from learning specified undesired concepts during fine-tuning and outperforms existing methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

*Hao Zhen,Yunxiang Yang,Jidong J. Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MP-PVIR is a unified framework that processes multi-view video streams to generate structured diagnostic reports for pedestrian-vehicle incidents through four stages: multi-view acquisition, pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, phase-specific reasoning, and hierarchical synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents cause over 20% of global traffic fatalities, but existing video systems only detect when incidents occur without providing insights into how they unfold across cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior.

Method: The framework uses two specialized VLMs: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, followed by an LLM to generate comprehensive reports with scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations.

Result: TG-VLM achieves mIoU of 0.4881 for phase segmentation, while PhaVR-VLM achieves captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. The system effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights.

Conclusion: MP-PVIR advances AI-driven traffic safety analytics by systematically processing multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports with causal chains and prevention strategies, enabling better understanding of pedestrian-vehicle incidents.

Abstract: Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.

TL;DR: Convolution and self-attention are unified under a single k-nearest neighbor framework where convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity and attention by feature similarity, existing on a continuous spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the apparent distinction between convolutional neural networks and transformers by showing both convolution and self-attention are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation.

Method: Introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN) framework that serves as drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection.

Result: ConvNN improves accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 with hybrid VGG branching and outperforms standard attention in ViT. Interpolating along the spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields.

Conclusion: The work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the distinction between convolution and attention, enabling more principled and interpretable vision architecture design.

Abstract: The shift from Convolutional Neural Networks to Transformers has reshaped computer vision, yet these two architectural families are typically viewed as fundamentally distinct. We argue that convolution and self-attention, despite their apparent differences, can be unified within a single k-nearest neighbor aggregation framework. The critical insight is that both operations are special cases of neighbor selection and aggregation; convolution selects neighbors by spatial proximity, while attention selects by feature similarity, revealing they exist on a continuous spectrum. We introduce Convolutional Nearest Neighbors (ConvNN), a unified framework that formalizes this connection. Crucially, ConvNN serves as a drop-in replacement for convolutional and attention layers, enabling systematic exploration of the intermediate spectrum between these two extremes. We validate the framework's coherence on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification tasks across two complementary architectures: (1) Hybrid branching in VGG improves accuracy on both CIFAR datasets by combining spatial-proximity and feature-similarity selection; and (2) ConvNN in ViT outperforms standard attention and other attention variants on both datasets. Extensive ablations on $k$ values and architectural variants reveal that interpolating along this spectrum provides regularization benefits by balancing local and global receptive fields. Our work provides a unifying framework that dissolves the apparent distinction between convolution and attention, with implications for designing more principled and interpretable vision architectures.

TL;DR: SMART is a multimodal framework for video moment retrieval that integrates audio cues and shot-level temporal structure using selective token compression to improve temporal localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video moment retrieval methods rely on coarse temporal understanding and single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos with rich multimodal content.

Method: SMART combines audio and visual features with Shot-aware Token Compression to selectively retain high-information tokens within each shot, reducing redundancy while preserving fine-grained temporal details. It also uses refined prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues.

Result: SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with 1.61% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA, and strong performance on QVHighlights.

Conclusion: Integrating audio cues and shot-level temporal structure through selective token compression effectively enhances multimodal representations for video moment retrieval, leading to improved temporal localization accuracy.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iGaussian is a real-time camera pose estimation method that uses direct 3D Gaussian inversion instead of iterative render-compare-refine loops, achieving 10x speedup over optimization-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose estimation methods rely on computationally expensive iterative render-compare-refine loops that hinder real-time performance in robotics applications.

Method: Two-stage feed-forward framework: 1) Coarse 6DoF pose regression using Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention, 2) Refinement through feature matching and multi-model fusion with cross-correlation module and Weighted Multiview Predictor.

Result: Reduces median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots - 10x speedup compared to optimization-based approaches on NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T&T+DB datasets.

Conclusion: iGaussian demonstrates that direct 3D Gaussian inversion enables real-time camera pose estimation without differentiable rendering, making it suitable for robotics applications requiring fast performance.

Abstract: Recent trends in SLAM and visual navigation have embraced 3D Gaussians as the preferred scene representation, highlighting the importance of estimating camera poses from a single image using a pre-built Gaussian model. However, existing approaches typically rely on an iterative \textit{render-compare-refine} loop, where candidate views are first rendered using NeRF or Gaussian Splatting, then compared against the target image, and finally, discrepancies are used to update the pose. This multi-round process incurs significant computational overhead, hindering real-time performance in robotics. In this paper, we propose iGaussian, a two-stage feed-forward framework that achieves real-time camera pose estimation through direct 3D Gaussian inversion. Our method first regresses a coarse 6DoF pose using a Gaussian Scene Prior-based Pose Regression Network with spatial uniform sampling and guided attention mechanisms, then refines it through feature matching and multi-model fusion. The key contribution lies in our cross-correlation module that aligns image embeddings with 3D Gaussian attributes without differentiable rendering, coupled with a Weighted Multiview Predictor that fuses features from Multiple strategically sampled viewpoints. Experimental results on the NeRF Synthetic, Mip-NeRF 360, and T\&T+DB datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement over previous methods, reducing median rotation errors to 0.2° while achieving 2.87 FPS tracking on mobile robots, which is an impressive 10 times speedup compared to optimization-based approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable 3D shape reconstruction of hidden objects for applications in robotics, augmented reality, and logistics, overcoming limitations of past mmWave methods that suffer from limited coverage and high noise.

Method: A three-stage pipeline that bridges raw wireless signals with vision-based shape completion: proposes candidate geometric surfaces, uses transformer-based shape completion model designed for mmWave signals, and performs entropy-guided surface selection. Can be trained entirely on synthetic point-clouds.

Result: Achieves 72% recall (up from 54% in state-of-the-art baselines) while maintaining 85% precision in head-to-head comparisons.

Conclusion: Wave-Former demonstrates impressive generalization to real-world data and significantly improves 3D shape reconstruction accuracy for occluded objects using mmWave signals.

Abstract: We present Wave-Former, a novel method capable of high-accuracy 3D shape reconstruction for completely occluded, diverse, everyday objects. This capability can open new applications spanning robotics, augmented reality, and logistics. Our approach leverages millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless signals, which can penetrate common occlusions and reflect off hidden objects. In contrast to past mmWave reconstruction methods, which suffer from limited coverage and high noise, Wave-Former introduces a physics-aware shape completion model capable of inferring full 3D geometry. At the heart of Wave-Former's design is a novel three-stage pipeline which bridges raw wireless signals with recent advancements in vision-based shape completion by incorporating physical properties of mmWave signals. The pipeline proposes candidate geometric surfaces, employs a transformer-based shape completion model designed specifically for mmWave signals, and finally performs entropy-guided surface selection. This enables Wave-Former to be trained using entirely synthetic point-clouds, while demonstrating impressive generalization to real-world data.In head-to-head comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines, Wave-Former raises recall from 54% to 72% while maintaining a high precision of 85%.

TL;DR: RiSe framework addresses multimodal face anti-spoofing's cross-domain generalization issues through asymmetric invariant risk minimization and multimodal synergy disentanglement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal FAS methods suffer severe performance degradation in unseen domains due to modal representation invariant risk and modal synergy invariant risk that affect cross-domain generalization.

Method: Proposes RiSe framework with Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM) for learning invariant spherical decision boundaries, and Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD) for enhancing generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance, with theoretical analysis and experiments verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: RiSe successfully addresses the two overlooked risks in multimodal FAS and provides a provable framework for improving cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Multimodal Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) methods, which integrate multiple visual modalities, often suffer even more severe performance degradation than unimodal FAS when deployed in unseen domains. This is mainly due to two overlooked risks that affect cross-domain multimodal generalization. The first is the modal representation invariant risk, i.e., whether representations remain generalizable under domain shift. We theoretically show that the inherent class asymmetry in FAS (diverse spoofs vs. compact reals) enlarges the upper bound of generalization error, and this effect is further amplified in multimodal settings. The second is the modal synergy invariant risk, where models overfit to domain-specific inter-modal correlations. Such spurious synergy cannot generalize to unseen attacks in target domains, leading to performance drops. To solve these issues, we propose a provable framework, namely Multimodal Representation and Synergy Invariance Learning (RiSe). For representation risk, RiSe introduces Asymmetric Invariant Risk Minimization (AsyIRM), which learns an invariant spherical decision boundary in radial space to fit asymmetric distributions, while preserving domain cues in angular space. For synergy risk, RiSe employs Multimodal Synergy Disentanglement (MMSD), a self-supervised task enhancing intrinsic, generalizable modal features via cross-sample mixing and disentanglement. Theoretical analysis and experiments verify RiSe, which achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain performance.

TL;DR: MVI-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LVLM robustness against misleading visual inputs, featuring 1,248 annotated VQA instances across three hierarchical levels and introducing a novel granular robustness metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robustness benchmarks focus on hallucination or misleading text, overlooking the critical challenge of misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding capabilities of LVLMs.

Method: Created MVI-Bench with three hierarchical levels (Visual Concept, Attribute, Relationship) and six categories, compiled 1,248 expert-annotated VQA instances, and introduced MVI-Sensitivity metric for fine-grained robustness evaluation.

Result: Empirical evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs revealed pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, with in-depth analyses providing actionable insights for improvement.

Conclusion: MVI-Bench fills an important gap in LVLM robustness evaluation and provides guidance for developing more reliable and robust vision-language models.

Abstract: Evaluating the robustness of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) is essential for their continued development and responsible deployment in real-world applications. However, existing robustness benchmarks typically focus on hallucination or misleading textual inputs, while largely overlooking the equally critical challenge posed by misleading visual inputs in assessing visual understanding. To fill this important gap, we introduce MVI-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specially designed for evaluating how Misleading Visual Inputs undermine the robustness of LVLMs. Grounded in fundamental visual primitives, the design of MVI-Bench centers on three hierarchical levels of misleading visual inputs: Visual Concept, Visual Attribute, and Visual Relationship. Using this taxonomy, we curate six representative categories and compile 1,248 expertly annotated VQA instances. To facilitate fine-grained robustness evaluation, we further introduce MVI-Sensitivity, a novel metric that characterizes LVLM robustness at a granular level. Empirical results across 18 state-of-the-art LVLMs uncover pronounced vulnerabilities to misleading visual inputs, and our in-depth analyses on MVI-Bench provide actionable insights that can guide the development of more reliable and robust LVLMs. The benchmark and codebase can be accessed at https://github.com/chenyil6/MVI-Bench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O3SLM is a new Large Vision Language Model that addresses LVLMs' limitations in understanding hand-drawn sketches by introducing a large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets and achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple sketch-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLMs struggle to interpret abstract visual inputs like hand-drawn sketches, which offer intuitive ways to express concepts that are difficult to describe textually. The main bottleneck is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly model sketches, photorealistic images, and natural language instructions.

Method: Two key contributions: (1) a new large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets for pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. The model is evaluated on multiple sketch-based tasks using existing datasets (QuickDraw!, Sketchy, Tu Berlin) and their generated SketchVCL dataset.

Result: O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple sketch-based tasks including object localization, counting, image retrieval (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and visual question answering (VQA), substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and O3SLM model successfully address the limitations of LVLMs in sketch understanding, demonstrating superior performance across various sketch-based reasoning tasks and establishing a new benchmark for sketch comprehension in vision-language models.

Abstract: While Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, their ability to interpret abstract visual inputs remains limited. Specifically, they struggle to comprehend hand-drawn sketches, a modality that offers an intuitive means of expressing concepts that are difficult to describe textually. We identify the primary bottleneck as the absence of a large-scale dataset that jointly models sketches, photorealistic images, and corresponding natural language instructions. To address this, we present two key contributions: (1) a new, large-scale dataset of image-sketch-instruction triplets designed to facilitate both pretraining and instruction tuning, and (2) O3SLM, an LVLM trained on this dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple sketch-based tasks: (a) object localization, (b) counting, (c) image retrieval i.e., (SBIR and fine-grained SBIR), and (d) visual question answering (VQA); while incorporating the three existing sketch datasets, namely QuickDraw!, Sketchy, and Tu Berlin, along with our generated SketchVCL dataset, show that O3SLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming existing LVLMs in sketch comprehension and reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression in MLLMs, reducing token usage by 90% while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-level tokenization in MLLMs causes quadratic token growth, computational burden, and misalignment with human vision cognition, leading to hallucination and redundancy.

Method: Object-level token merging strategy for adaptive token compression that aligns with human vision system.

Result: Achieves 90% token reduction (using only 10% tokens) while maintaining 96% of vanilla model performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates superior balance between compression ratio and performance compared to relevant works.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGCLR is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition that uses game theory to dynamically balance positive and negative sample construction, with spatio-temporal localization and entropy-driven memory management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods process all skeleton regions uniformly and use FIFO queues for negative samples, leading to motion information loss and suboptimal negative sample selection.

Method: Models sample construction as a Dominance Game with spatio-temporal dual weight localization for key motion regions and entropy-driven dominance strategy for memory bank management.

Result: Achieves 81.1%/89.4% on NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View and 71.2%/75.5% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, surpassing SOTA by 0.1-2.7%. On PKU-MMD Part II, achieves 1.9% higher accuracy.

Conclusion: DoGCLR demonstrates strong performance and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios, through its game-theoretic approach to sample construction and entropy-based negative sample management.

Abstract: Existing self-supervised contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition often process all skeleton regions uniformly, and adopt a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue to store negative samples, which leads to motion information loss and non-optimal negative sample selection. To address these challenges, this paper proposes Dominance-Game Contrastive Learning network for skeleton-based action Recognition (DoGCLR), a self-supervised framework based on game theory. DoGCLR models the construction of positive and negative samples as a dynamic Dominance Game, where both sample types interact to reach an equilibrium that balances semantic preservation and discriminative strength. Specifically, a spatio-temporal dual weight localization mechanism identifies key motion regions and guides region-wise augmentations to enhance motion diversity while maintaining semantics. In parallel, an entropy-driven dominance strategy manages the memory bank by retaining high entropy (hard) negatives and replacing low-entropy (weak) ones, ensuring consistent exposure to informative contrastive signals. Extensive experiments are conducted on NTU RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets. On NTU RGB+D 60 X-Sub/X-View, DoGCLR achieves 81.1%/89.4% accuracy, and on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Sub/X-Set, DoGCLR achieves 71.2%/75.5% accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 0.1%, 2.7%, 1.1%, and 2.3%, respectively. On PKU-MMD Part I/Part II, DoGCLR performs comparably to the state-of-the-art methods and achieves a 1.9% higher accuracy on Part II, highlighting its strong robustness on more challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniSER is a foundational versatile model that addresses diverse soft effect degradations (lens flare, haze, shadows, reflections) in a single framework, outperforming both specialist and generalist models through a massive 3.8M-pair dataset and tailored diffusion transformer training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches use highly specialized models for individual soft effects, lacking scalability and failing to exploit shared restoration essences, while generalist models require detailed prompts and often fail on fine-grained tasks or scene identity preservation.

Method: Curated a massive 3.8M-pair dataset with novel physically-plausible data, and developed a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer with fine-grained mask and strength controls to learn robust restoration priors.

Result: UniSER significantly outperforms both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild for diverse soft effect degradations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach demonstrates that leveraging the common essence of soft effects (semi-transparent occlusions) enables a single versatile model to effectively address multiple degradation types, overcoming limitations of both specialized and general-purpose systems.

Abstract: Digital images are often degraded by soft effects such as lens flare, haze, shadows, and reflections, which reduce aesthetics even though the underlying pixels remain partially visible. The prevailing works address these degradations in isolation, developing highly specialized, specialist models that lack scalability and fail to exploit the shared underlying essences of these restoration problems. While specialist models are limited, recent large-scale pretrained generalist models offer powerful, text-driven image editing capabilities. while recent general-purpose systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Flux Kontext, Nano Banana) require detailed prompts and often fail to achieve robust removal on these fine-grained tasks or preserve identity of the scene. Leveraging the common essence of soft effects, i.e., semi-transparent occlusions, we introduce a foundational versatile model UniSER, capable of addressing diverse degradations caused by soft effects within a single framework. Our methodology centers on curating a massive 3.8M-pair dataset to ensure robustness and generalization, which includes novel, physically-plausible data to fill critical gaps in public benchmarks, and a tailored training pipeline that fine-tunes a Diffusion Transformer to learn robust restoration priors from this diverse data, integrating fine-grained mask and strength controls. This synergistic approach allows UniSER to significantly outperform both specialist and generalist models, achieving robust, high-fidelity restoration in the wild.

*Xuan Zhao,Zhongyu Zhang,Yuge Huang,Yuxi Mi,Guodong Mu,Shouhong Ding,Jun Wang,Rizen Guo,Shuigeng Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GloTok introduces a global perspective tokenizer that uses codebook-wise histogram relation learning and residual modules to create more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, improving image reconstruction and generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image tokenization methods use local semantic supervision which limits uniformity of semantic distribution, while VA-VAE shows that more uniform feature distributions yield better generation performance.

Method: Uses global relational information via codebook-wise histogram relation learning to transfer dataset-wide semantics to semantic codebook, plus residual learning module to recover fine-grained details and minimize reconstruction errors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality on ImageNet-1k benchmark, producing more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations.

Conclusion: GloTok's global perspective approach with relational learning and residual modules enables better image tokenization that facilitates high-quality image generation without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during training.

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art image tokenization methods leverage diverse semantic features from pre-trained vision models for additional supervision, to expand the distribution of latent representations and thereby improve the quality of image reconstruction and generation. These methods employ a locally supervised approach for semantic supervision, which limits the uniformity of semantic distribution. However, VA-VAE proves that a more uniform feature distribution yields better generation performance. In this work, we introduce a Global Perspective Tokenizer (GloTok), which utilizes global relational information to model a more uniform semantic distribution of tokenized features. Specifically, a codebook-wise histogram relation learning method is proposed to transfer the semantics, which are modeled by pre-trained models on the entire dataset, to the semantic codebook. Then, we design a residual learning module that recovers the fine-grained details to minimize the reconstruction error caused by quantization. Through the above design, GloTok delivers more uniformly distributed semantic latent representations, which facilitates the training of autoregressive (AR) models for generating high-quality images without requiring direct access to pre-trained models during the training process. Experiments on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark clearly show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance and generation quality.

TL;DR: First end-to-end autonomous driving dataset collected entirely by autonomous vehicles in real-world conditions, containing 100+ hours of naturalistic data with detailed annotations for safety evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets collected by human drivers are insufficient for evaluating real behavioral safety of autonomous vehicles in black-box systems.

Method: Collected data from multiple production AV models, segmented into 32,727 key frames with synchronized camera images, GNSS/IMU data, and 20Hz vehicle trajectories spanning past 6s and future 5s.

Result: Dataset provides rich scenario-level attributes and enables end-to-end motion planning model with 1.4m Average Displacement Error on autonomous-driving frames.

Conclusion: This dataset establishes a sustainable foundation for AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation, with continuous weekly expansion of 10+ hours of new data.

Abstract: Most existing autonomous-driving datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, and the Waymo Perception Dataset), collected by human-driving mode or unidentified driving mode, can only serve as early training for the perception and prediction of autonomous vehicles (AVs). To evaluate the real behavioral safety of AVs controlled in the black box, we present the first end-to-end benchmark dataset collected entirely by autonomous-driving mode in the real world. This dataset contains over 100 hours of naturalistic data from multiple production autonomous-driving vehicle models in the market. We segment the original data into 32,727 key frames, each consisting of four synchronized camera images and high-precision GNSS/IMU data (0.8 cm localization accuracy). For each key frame, 20 Hz vehicle trajectories spanning the past 6 s and future 5 s are provided, along with detailed 2D annotations of surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and traffic signs. These key frames have rich scenario-level attributes, including driver intent, area type (covering highways, urban roads, and residential areas), lighting (day, night, or dusk), weather (clear or rain), road surface (paved or unpaved), traffic and vulnerable road users (VRU) density, traffic lights, and traffic signs (warning, prohibition, and indication). To evaluate the safety of AVs, we employ an end-to-end motion planning model that predicts vehicle trajectories with an Average Displacement Error (ADE) of 1.4 m on autonomous-driving frames. The dataset continues to expand by over 10 hours of new data weekly, thereby providing a sustainable foundation for research on AV driving behavior analysis and safety evaluation.

TL;DR: UMEG-Net is a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network for few-shot precise event spotting that integrates human skeletons and object keypoints into a unified graph, achieving robust performance with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise event spotting is challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Existing methods require large labeled datasets and struggle in few-shot conditions, while obtaining large labeled datasets is practically difficult.

Method: Integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph, uses efficient spatio-temporal extraction with GCN and multi-scale temporal shift, and employs multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations.

Result: Achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and effective solution for few-shot precise event spotting, addressing the challenge of limited labeled data availability.

Abstract: Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel curriculum learning approach with fractal softmax for hierarchical 3D aorta segmentation that addresses class imbalance and improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency for clinical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for aorta segmentation overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships and struggle with severe class imbalance in vascular structures, limiting their clinical utility for minimally invasive repairs.

Method: Curriculum learning strategy with fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning, decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components, and two-stage inference for acceleration.

Result: 11.65% Dice score improvement on validation set, 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on test set, and up to fivefold acceleration in inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework significantly improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time clinical applications in aorta pathology diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: The aorta, the body's largest artery, is prone to pathologies such as dissection, aneurysm, and atherosclerosis, which often require timely intervention. Minimally invasive repairs involving branch vessels necessitate detailed 3D anatomical analysis. Existing methods often overlook hierarchical anatomical relationships while struggling with severe class imbalance inherent in vascular structures. We address these challenges with a curriculum learning strategy that leverages a novel fractal softmax for hierarchical semantic learning. Inspired by human cognition, our approach progressively learns anatomical constraints by decomposing complex structures from simple to complex components. The curriculum learning framework naturally addresses class imbalance by first establishing robust feature representations for dominant classes before tackling rare but anatomically critical structures, significantly accelerating model convergence in multi-class scenarios. Our two-stage inference strategy achieves up to fivefold acceleration, enhancing clinical practicality. On the validation set at epoch 50, our hierarchical semantic loss improves the Dice score of nnU-Net ResEnc M by 11.65%. The proposed model demonstrates a 5.6% higher Dice score than baselines on the test set. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and efficiency, making the framework suitable for real-time clinical applications. The implementation code for this challenge entry is publicly available at: https://github.com/PengchengShi1220/AortaSeg24.

TL;DR: DetGain is an online data curation method for object detection that selects informative training samples by estimating each image's impact on dataset-level Average Precision, improving accuracy efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality data drives progress in scale laws, but existing online sampling strategies don't work well for object detection due to its structural complexity and domain gaps.

Method: DetGain estimates marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level AP based on prediction quality, models global score distributions, computes teacher-student contribution gaps, and selects informative samples iteratively.

Result: Experiments on COCO dataset with multiple detectors show consistent accuracy improvements, strong robustness under low-quality data, and effective combination with knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: DetGain is a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection that is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive.

Abstract: High-quality data has become a primary driver of progress under scale laws, with curated datasets often outperforming much larger unfiltered ones at lower cost. Online data curation extends this idea by dynamically selecting training samples based on the model's evolving state. While effective in classification and multimodal learning, existing online sampling strategies rarely extend to object detection because of its structural complexity and domain gaps. We introduce DetGain, an online data curation method specifically for object detection that estimates the marginal perturbation of each image to dataset-level Average Precision (AP) based on its prediction quality. By modeling global score distributions, DetGain efficiently estimates the global AP change and computes teacher-student contribution gaps to select informative samples at each iteration. The method is architecture-agnostic and minimally intrusive, enabling straightforward integration into diverse object detection architectures. Experiments on the COCO dataset with multiple representative detectors show consistent improvements in accuracy. DetGain also demonstrates strong robustness under low-quality data and can be effectively combined with knowledge distillation techniques to further enhance performance, highlighting its potential as a general and complementary strategy for data-efficient object detection.

*Yunhe Liu*

TL;DR: MCFormer is a transformer-based network for maritime vessel re-identification that addresses intra-identity variations and local part missing through multi-scale correlation modeling using global and local correlation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vessel Re-ID methods adapted from pedestrian algorithms are ill-suited for maritime scenarios due to greater intra-identity variations and more severe local part missing, leading to outlier samples within the same identity.

Method: Proposes MCFormer with Global Correlation Module (GCM) that constructs global similarity affinity matrix across all input images, and Local Correlation Module (LCM) that mines and aligns local features using dynamic memory bank to compensate for missing regions.

Result: Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, showing effectiveness in handling intra-identity variations and local part missing issues.

Conclusion: MCFormer successfully addresses unique challenges in maritime vessel Re-ID by explicitly modeling multi-scale correlations, outperforming existing methods through its global and local correlation modules.

Abstract: Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstantViR is an ultra-fast video reconstruction framework that distills a bidirectional video diffusion model into a causal autoregressive student for real-time performance, achieving 35+ FPS while matching diffusion-based quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video inverse problems need high perceptual quality with low latency for streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR applications, but current diffusion-based methods are either temporally inconsistent or too slow for real-time use.

Method: Distill bidirectional video diffusion teacher into causal autoregressive student using prior-driven distillation without external data; replace VAE with LeanVAE for efficiency; enable single forward pass inference.

Result: Achieves 35+ FPS on A100 GPUs with 100x speedup over iterative methods; matches or surpasses diffusion baselines in quality for inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution tasks.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that diffusion-based video reconstruction can be practical for real-time, interactive streaming scenarios, making high-quality video restoration feasible for modern vision systems.

Abstract: Video inverse problems are fundamental to streaming, telepresence, and AR/VR, where high perceptual quality must coexist with tight latency constraints. Diffusion-based priors currently deliver state-of-the-art reconstructions, but existing approaches either adapt image diffusion models with ad hoc temporal regularizers - leading to temporal artifacts - or rely on native video diffusion models whose iterative posterior sampling is far too slow for real-time use. We introduce InstantViR, an amortized inference framework for ultra-fast video reconstruction powered by a pre-trained video diffusion prior. We distill a powerful bidirectional video diffusion model (teacher) into a causal autoregressive student that maps a degraded video directly to its restored version in a single forward pass, inheriting the teacher's strong temporal modeling while completely removing iterative test-time optimization. The distillation is prior-driven: it only requires the teacher diffusion model and known degradation operators, and does not rely on externally paired clean/noisy video data. To further boost throughput, we replace the video-diffusion backbone VAE with a high-efficiency LeanVAE via an innovative teacher-space regularized distillation scheme, enabling low-latency latent-space processing. Across streaming random inpainting, Gaussian deblurring and super-resolution, InstantViR matches or surpasses the reconstruction quality of diffusion-based baselines while running at over 35 FPS on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving up to 100 times speedups over iterative video diffusion solvers. These results show that diffusion-based video reconstruction is compatible with real-time, interactive, editable, streaming scenarios, turning high-quality video restoration into a practical component of modern vision systems.

*Wenjie Li,Yulun Zhang,Guangwei Gao,Heng Guo,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) for diverse blind face restoration using text-to-image diffusion with measurement constraints to handle one-to-many reconstruction problem.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing blind face restoration methods produce deterministic results but cannot capture the one-to-many nature where multiple plausible high-quality reconstructions are possible from low-quality inputs.

Method: Formulates BFR as measurement-constrained generative task using text-to-image diffusion with Forward Measurement (aligns with input structures) and Reverse Measurement (creates projection spaces for prompt alignment).

Result: MCS generates prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods in experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed MCS approach successfully enables diverse face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts while maintaining measurement constraints.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) may correspond to multiple plausible high-quality (HQ) reconstructions under extremely low-quality (LQ) inputs. However, existing methods typically produce deterministic results, struggling to capture this one-to-many nature. In this paper, we propose a Measurement-Constrained Sampling (MCS) approach that enables diverse LQ face reconstructions conditioned on different textual prompts. Specifically, we formulate BFR as a measurement-constrained generative task by constructing an inverse problem through controlled degradations of coarse restorations, which allows posterior-guided sampling within text-to-image diffusion. Measurement constraints include both Forward Measurement, which ensures results align with input structures, and Reverse Measurement, which produces projection spaces, ensuring that the solution can align with various prompts. Experiments show that our MCS can generate prompt-aligned results and outperforms existing BFR methods. Codes will be released after acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes an autoregressive diffusion model for real-time speech-driven 3D facial animation that processes audio in streaming chunks to handle variable lengths and reduce latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing audio-conditioned diffusion models that process entire audio sequences at once, leading to poor performance on long sequences and high latency.

Method: Uses an autoregressive diffusion model with limited past frames as historical context combined with audio input to create dynamic conditions for iterative facial motion generation.

Result: Achieves flexibility with varying audio lengths, low latency independent of audio duration, and real-time synthesis with high-quality facial animations.

Conclusion: The proposed streaming approach enables efficient real-time 3D facial animation with improved handling of long audio sequences and reduced latency compared to single-pass methods.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of speech-driven 3D facial animation, which aims to generate realistic and synchronized facial motions driven by speech inputs.Recent methods have employed audio-conditioned diffusion models for 3D facial animation, achieving impressive results in generating expressive and natural animations.However, these methods process the whole audio sequences in a single pass, which poses two major challenges: they tend to perform poorly when handling audio sequences that exceed the training horizon and will suffer from significant latency when processing long audio inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autoregressive diffusion model that processes input audio in a streaming manner. This design ensures flexibility with varying audio lengths and achieves low latency independent of audio duration. Specifically, we select a limited number of past frames as historical motion context and combine them with the audio input to create a dynamic condition. This condition guides the diffusion process to iteratively generate facial motion frames, enabling real-time synthesis with high-quality results. Additionally, we implemented a real-time interactive demo, highlighting the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. We will release the code at https://zju3dv.github.io/StreamingTalker/.

*Juncheng Hu,Zijian Zhang,Zeyu Wang,Guoyu Wang,Yingji Li,Kedi Lyu*

TL;DR: APS introduces active perceptual strategy for 3D human motion prediction using quotient space representations and auxiliary learning objectives to overcome passive learning limitations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches rely too much on implicit network modeling and fall into passive learning traps, lacking explicit guidance mechanisms and resulting in redundant coordinate information acquisition.

Method: Uses quotient space representations to project poses for geometric dimension reduction and semantic decoupling, plus auxiliary learning with deliberate masking/noise injection to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art with significant improvements: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW datasets.

Conclusion: APS provides an effective active perceptual strategy that is model-agnostic and significantly enhances 3D human motion prediction performance through explicit motion property encoding and active spatio-temporal learning.

Abstract: Forecasting 3D human motion is an important embodiment of fine-grained understanding and cognition of human behavior by artificial agents. Current approaches excessively rely on implicit network modeling of spatiotemporal relationships and motion characteristics, falling into the passive learning trap that results in redundant and monotonous 3D coordinate information acquisition while lacking actively guided explicit learning mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose an Active Perceptual Strategy (APS) for human motion prediction, leveraging quotient space representations to explicitly encode motion properties while introducing auxiliary learning objectives to strengthen spatio-temporal modeling. Specifically, we first design a data perception module that projects poses into the quotient space, decoupling motion geometry from coordinate redundancy. By jointly encoding tangent vectors and Grassmann projections, this module simultaneously achieves geometric dimension reduction, semantic decoupling, and dynamic constraint enforcement for effective motion pose characterization. Furthermore, we introduce a network perception module that actively learns spatio-temporal dependencies through restorative learning. This module deliberately masks specific joints or injects noise to construct auxiliary supervision signals. A dedicated auxiliary learning network is designed to actively adapt and learn from perturbed information. Notably, APS is model agnostic and can be integrated with different prediction models to enhance active perceptual. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods by large margins: 16.3% on H3.6M, 13.9% on CMU Mocap, and 10.1% on 3DPW.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeSTAR is a parameter-efficient framework that enhances foundation models for monocular depth estimation through weakly supervised self-training with regularization, improving robustness in unseen domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve foundation models' performance in monocular depth estimation when some downstream task data is available, addressing the need for better generalization in diverse and unseen domains.

Method: Uses dense self-training with semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, weak supervision via pairwise ordinal depth annotations, and weight regularization to anchor LoRA updates while preserving generalizable knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments show WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks, including realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets.

Conclusion: WeSTAR effectively enhances MDE foundation models' robustness through parameter-efficient adaptation with multiple regularization strategies, demonstrating superior performance in challenging scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models has substantially advanced zero-shot generalization in monocular depth estimation (MDE), as exemplified by the Depth Anything series. However, given access to some data from downstream tasks, a natural question arises: can the performance of these models be further improved? To this end, we propose WeSTAR, a parameter-efficient framework that performs Weakly supervised Self-Training Adaptation with Regularization, designed to enhance the robustness of MDE foundation models in unseen and diverse domains. We first adopt a dense self-training objective as the primary source of structural self-supervision. To further improve robustness, we introduce semantically-aware hierarchical normalization, which exploits instance-level segmentation maps to perform more stable and multi-scale structural normalization. Beyond dense supervision, we introduce a cost-efficient weak supervision in the form of pairwise ordinal depth annotations to further guide the adaptation process, which enforces informative ordinal constraints to mitigate local topological errors. Finally, a weight regularization loss is employed to anchor the LoRA updates, ensuring training stability and preserving the model's generalizable knowledge. Extensive experiments on both realistic and corrupted out-of-distribution datasets under diverse and challenging scenarios demonstrate that WeSTAR consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of benchmarks.

TL;DR: A GNSS-free collaborative perception framework using LiDAR localization with pose confidence estimation and spatio-temporal alignment to overcome localization errors in GNSS-denied environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNSS-based localization fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult for multi-agent collaborative perception.

Method: Proposed Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) for compact pose and confidence estimation, and Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT) for confidence-aware spatial alignment with temporal context. Also created V2VLoc simulation dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on V2VLoc dataset under GNSS-denied conditions, with effectiveness validated on real-world V2V4Real dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides robust collaborative perception without GNSS, with demonstrated effectiveness and generalizability across simulation and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Multi-agents rely on accurate poses to share and align observations, enabling a collaborative perception of the environment. However, traditional GNSS-based localization often fails in GNSS-denied environments, making consistent feature alignment difficult in collaboration. To tackle this challenge, we propose a robust GNSS-free collaborative perception framework based on LiDAR localization. Specifically, we propose a lightweight Pose Generator with Confidence (PGC) to estimate compact pose and confidence representations. To alleviate the effects of localization errors, we further develop the Pose-Aware Spatio-Temporal Alignment Transformer (PASTAT), which performs confidence-aware spatial alignment while capturing essential temporal context. Additionally, we present a new simulation dataset, V2VLoc, which can be adapted for both LiDAR localization and collaborative detection tasks. V2VLoc comprises three subsets: Town1Loc, Town4Loc, and V2VDet. Town1Loc and Town4Loc offer multi-traversal sequences for training in localization tasks, whereas V2VDet is specifically intended for the collaborative detection task. Extensive experiments conducted on the V2VLoc dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under GNSS-denied conditions. We further conduct extended experiments on the real-world V2V4Real dataset to validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PASTAT.

Motivation: Existing image manipulation detection benchmarks have limited diversity, narrow model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, hindering generalization and explanation capabilities of detection methods.

Method: Created ManipBench with 450K+ manipulated images from 25 state-of-the-art editing models across 12 categories, with 100K images annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations. Proposed ManipShield using Multimodal Large Language Model with contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders.

Result: ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance on ManipBench and public datasets, demonstrating strong generalization to unseen manipulation models.

Conclusion: Both ManipBench and ManipShield address limitations of existing benchmarks and methods, providing comprehensive solutions for interpretable image manipulation detection and localization.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, powerful image editing methods now enable diverse and highly realistic image manipulations that far surpass traditional deepfake techniques, posing new challenges for manipulation detection. Existing image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL) benchmarks suffer from limited content diversity, narrow generative-model coverage, and insufficient interpretability, which hinders the generalization and explanation capabilities of current manipulation detection methods. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{ManipBench}, a large-scale benchmark for image manipulation detection and localization focusing on AI-edited images. ManipBench contains over 450K manipulated images produced by 25 state-of-the-art image editing models across 12 manipulation categories, among which 100K images are further annotated with bounding boxes, judgment cues, and textual explanations to support interpretable detection. Building upon ManipBench, we propose \textbf{ManipShield}, an all-in-one model based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that leverages contrastive LoRA fine-tuning and task-specific decoders to achieve unified image manipulation detection, localization, and explanation. Extensive experiments on ManipBench and several public datasets demonstrate that ManipShield achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generality to unseen manipulation models. Both ManipBench and ManipShield will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: Proposes GSLR framework using Gaussian splatting for improved tensor representation of multi-dimensional images, addressing limitations of traditional t-SVD methods in capturing local high-frequency information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional t-SVD methods have two key limitations: coarse approximation of latent tensor that fails to capture spatial local high-frequency information, and fixed basis atoms in transform matrix that cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along mode-3 fibers.

Method: Uses 2D Gaussian splatting to generate latent tensor and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate transform matrix, creating a continuous representation framework where both components are complementary and essential for powerful representation capability.

Result: Extensive experiments show GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-dimensional image recovery, particularly excelling at capturing local high-frequency information.

Conclusion: GSLR provides a compact and continuous representation framework for multi-dimensional images that effectively addresses the limitations of traditional t-SVD methods, especially in preserving local high-frequency details.

Abstract: Tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) is a promising tool for multi-dimensional image representation, which decomposes a multi-dimensional image into a latent tensor and an accompanying transform matrix. However, two critical limitations of t-SVD methods persist: (1) the approximation of the latent tensor (e.g., tensor factorizations) is coarse and fails to accurately capture spatial local high-frequency information; (2) The transform matrix is composed of fixed basis atoms (e.g., complex exponential atoms in DFT and cosine atoms in DCT) and cannot precisely capture local high-frequency information along the mode-3 fibers. To address these two limitations, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based Low-rank tensor Representation (GSLR) framework, which compactly and continuously represents multi-dimensional images. Specifically, we leverage tailored 2D Gaussian splatting and 1D Gaussian splatting to generate the latent tensor and transform matrix, respectively. The 2D and 1D Gaussian splatting are indispensable and complementary under this representation framework, which enjoys a powerful representation capability, especially for local high-frequency information. To evaluate the representation ability of the proposed GSLR, we develop an unsupervised GSLR-based multi-dimensional image recovery model. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image recovery demonstrate that GSLR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in capturing local high-frequency information.

TL;DR: VLM3D uses vision-language models as differentiable critics to improve text-to-3D generation by addressing semantic alignment and spatial understanding issues through dual-query critic signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-3D models struggle with fine-grained semantic alignment and robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and failures in part assembly.

Method: Proposes VLM3D framework that repurposes VLMs as differentiable semantic and spatial critics using dual-query critic signals derived from Yes/No log-odds, applicable to both optimization-based and feed-forward pipelines.

Result: VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks for optimization-based pipelines and corrects severe spatial errors in feed-forward pipelines through test-time guidance.

Conclusion: VLM3D provides a principled and generalizable approach to inject VLM's language-grounded understanding of semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation has advanced rapidly, yet state-of-the-art models, encompassing both optimization-based and feed-forward architectures, still face two fundamental limitations. First, they struggle with coarse semantic alignment, often failing to capture fine-grained prompt details. Second, they lack robust 3D spatial understanding, leading to geometric inconsistencies and catastrophic failures in part assembly and spatial relationships. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a general framework that repurposes large vision-language models (VLMs) as powerful, differentiable semantic and spatial critics. Our core contribution is a dual-query critic signal derived from the VLM's Yes or No log-odds, which assesses both semantic fidelity and geometric coherence. We demonstrate the generality of this guidance signal across two distinct paradigms: (1) As a reward objective for optimization-based pipelines, VLM3D significantly outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. (2) As a test-time guidance module for feed-forward pipelines, it actively steers the iterative sampling process of SOTA native 3D models to correct severe spatial errors. VLM3D establishes a principled and generalizable path to inject the VLM's rich, language-grounded understanding of both semantics and space into diverse 3D generative pipelines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes using Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as codebooks to reconstruct target domain features, enabling fast domain alignment for cross-domain few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three key challenges in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning: semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity, by focusing on intermediate domain construction rather than just generalized representations.

Method: Construct IDP using source feature embeddings as codebooks, reconstruct target domain features with learned codebooks, and develop fast domain alignment using proxies as guidance for target feature transformation.

Result: The proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation effectively addresses CDFSL challenges and achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CDFSL) endeavors to transfer generalized knowledge from the source domain to target domains using only a minimal amount of training data, which faces a triplet of learning challenges in the meantime, i.e., semantic disjoint, large domain discrepancy, and data scarcity. Different from predominant CDFSL works focused on generalized representations, we make novel attempts to construct Intermediate Domain Proxies (IDP) with source feature embeddings as the codebook and reconstruct the target domain feature with this learned codebook. We then conduct an empirical study to explore the intrinsic attributes from perspectives of visual styles and semantic contents in intermediate domain proxies. Reaping benefits from these attributes of intermediate domains, we develop a fast domain alignment method to use these proxies as learning guidance for target domain feature transformation. With the collaborative learning of intermediate domain reconstruction and target feature transformation, our proposed model is able to surpass the state-of-the-art models by a margin on 8 cross-domain few-shot learning benchmarks.

Motivation: Existing implicit surface reconstruction methods lack explicit mechanisms to ensure tight fit between reconstructed surfaces and input point cloud data.

Method: Proposes NeuralSSD with a novel energy equation balancing point cloud reliability and a 3D convolutional network that learns spatial information for superior optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ShapeNet and Matterport datasets with high surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

Conclusion: NeuralSSD enables accurate and stable surface reconstruction by ensuring close adherence to input points and learning valuable inductive biases from point clouds.

Abstract: We proposed a generalized method, NeuralSSD, for reconstructing a 3D implicit surface from the widely-available point cloud data. NeuralSSD is a solver-based on the neural Galerkin method, aimed at reconstructing higher-quality and accurate surfaces from input point clouds. Implicit method is preferred due to its ability to accurately represent shapes and its robustness in handling topological changes. However, existing parameterizations of implicit fields lack explicit mechanisms to ensure a tight fit between the surface and input data. To address this, we propose a novel energy equation that balances the reliability of point cloud information. Additionally, we introduce a new convolutional network that learns three-dimensional information to achieve superior optimization results. This approach ensures that the reconstructed surface closely adheres to the raw input points and infers valuable inductive biases from point clouds, resulting in a highly accurate and stable surface reconstruction. NeuralSSD is evaluated on a variety of challenging datasets, including the ShapeNet and Matterport datasets, and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both surface reconstruction accuracy and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in cross-modal registration between preoperative and intraoperative data in orthopedic surgery due to modality heterogeneity, which is error-prone and clinically important for accurate surgical plan transfer.

Method: Two-module framework: implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) learns preoperative bone model, and MLP-based registration performs global initialization and local refinement using transformation hypotheses to align intraoperative point clouds.

Result: Achieved mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth, matching or surpassing existing methods across all datasets.

Conclusion: NeuralBoneReg demonstrates strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for computer-assisted orthopedic surgery.

Abstract: In computer- and robot-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), patient-specific surgical plans derived from preoperative imaging define target locations and implant trajectories. During surgery, these plans must be accurately transferred, relying on precise cross-registration between preoperative and intraoperative data. However, substantial modality heterogeneity across imaging modalities makes this registration challenging and error-prone. Robust, automatic, and modality-agnostic bone surface registration is therefore clinically important. We propose NeuralBoneReg, a self-supervised, surface-based framework that registers bone surfaces using 3D point clouds as a modality-agnostic representation. NeuralBoneReg includes two modules: an implicit neural unsigned distance field (UDF) that learns the preoperative bone model, and an MLP-based registration module that performs global initialization and local refinement by generating transformation hypotheses to align the intraoperative point cloud with the neural UDF. Unlike SOTA supervised methods, NeuralBoneReg operates in a self-supervised manner, without requiring inter-subject training data. We evaluated NeuralBoneReg against baseline methods on two publicly available multi-modal datasets: a CT-ultrasound dataset of the fibula and tibia (UltraBones100k) and a CT-RGB-D dataset of spinal vertebrae (SpineDepth). The evaluation also includes a newly introduced CT--ultrasound dataset of cadaveric subjects containing femur and pelvis (UltraBones-Hip), which will be made publicly available. NeuralBoneReg matches or surpasses existing methods across all datasets, achieving mean RRE/RTE of 1.68°/1.86 mm on UltraBones100k, 1.88°/1.89 mm on UltraBones-Hip, and 3.79°/2.45 mm on SpineDepth. These results demonstrate strong generalizability across anatomies and modalities, providing robust and accurate cross-modal alignment for CAOS.

Conclusion: SAM-Fed effectively addresses FSSL challenges by using foundation model guidance and adaptive mechanisms to improve pseudo-label quality and segmentation performance in medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.

Result: Achieves best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data, progressively enhancing projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Diff-NAF effectively addresses ultra-sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges through iterative refinement, yielding high-quality reconstructions where traditional methods struggle.

Abstract: Multi-source stationary computed tomography (CT) has recently attracted attention for its ability to achieve rapid image reconstruction, making it suitable for time-sensitive clinical and industrial applications. However, practical systems are often constrained by ultra-sparse-view sampling, which significantly degrades reconstruction quality. Traditional methods struggle under ultra-sparse-view settings, where interpolation becomes inaccurate and the resulting reconstructions are unsatisfactory. To address this challenge, this study proposes Diffusion-Refined Neural Attenuation Fields (Diff-NAF), an iterative framework tailored for multi-source stationary CT under ultra-sparse-view conditions. Diff-NAF combines a Neural Attenuation Field representation with a dual-branch conditional diffusion model. The process begins by training an initial NAF using ultra-sparse-view projections. New projections are then generated through an Angle-Prior Guided Projection Synthesis strategy that exploits inter view priors, and are subsequently refined by a Diffusion-driven Reuse Projection Refinement Module. The refined projections are incorporated as pseudo-labels into the training set for the next iteration. Through iterative refinement, Diff-NAF progressively enhances projection completeness and reconstruction fidelity under ultra-sparse-view conditions, ultimately yielding high-quality CT reconstructions. Experimental results on multiple simulated 3D CT volumes and real projection data demonstrate that Diff-NAF achieves the best performance under ultra-sparse-view conditions.

TL;DR: Dental3R is a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust 3D dental reconstruction from sparse intraoral smartphone photos, addressing challenges in tele-orthodontics through intelligent image pairing and wavelet-regularized 3D Gaussian Splatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intraoral scanning methods are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which relies on sparse smartphone imagery. Existing 3D reconstruction methods struggle with large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, specular surfaces, and sparse-view photometric supervision that causes over-smoothed reconstructions lacking diagnostic details.

Method: Proposes Dental3R with two key components: 1) Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to select high-value image pairs for stable geometry initialization, and 2) 3D Gaussian Splatting trained with wavelet-regularized objective using discrete wavelet transform to preserve fine details while suppressing artifacts.

Result: Validated on 950 clinical cases and 195 video-based test cases. Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Dental3R provides a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D dental reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs, enabling effective tele-orthodontics by preserving critical diagnostic details that are often lost in conventional sparse-view reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Intraoral 3D reconstruction is fundamental to digital orthodontics, yet conventional methods like intraoral scanning are inaccessible for remote tele-orthodontics, which typically relies on sparse smartphone imagery. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows promise for novel view synthesis, its application to the standard clinical triad of unposed anterior and bilateral buccal photographs is challenging. The large view baselines, inconsistent illumination, and specular surfaces common in intraoral settings can destabilize simultaneous pose and geometry estimation. Furthermore, sparse-view photometric supervision often induces a frequency bias, leading to over-smoothed reconstructions that lose critical diagnostic details. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{Dental3R}, a pose-free, graph-guided pipeline for robust, high-fidelity reconstruction from sparse intraoral photographs. Our method first constructs a Geometry-Aware Pairing Strategy (GAPS) to intelligently select a compact subgraph of high-value image pairs. The GAPS focuses on correspondence matching, thereby improving the stability of the geometry initialization and reducing memory usage. Building on the recovered poses and point cloud, we train the 3DGS model with a wavelet-regularized objective. By enforcing band-limited fidelity using a discrete wavelet transform, our approach preserves fine enamel boundaries and interproximal edges while suppressing high-frequency artifacts. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset of 950 clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases. Experimental results demonstrate that Dental3R effectively handles sparse, unposed inputs and achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB. Meanwhile, real-time and high-accuracy inference under constrained computational resources was demonstrated on the SV830C + GC030A platform. The proposed approach is characterized by high efficiency, lightweight design and deployability, making it suitable for smart classrooms, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction applications.

TL;DR: StepsNet is a generalized residual architecture that addresses shortcut degradation and limited width issues in deep networks by separating features along channels and progressively increasing width through stacked blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current residual architectures struggle to realize theoretical capacity improvements as networks deepen due to shortcut degradation and limited width constraints.

Method: Separate features along channel dimension and use stacking blocks with increasing width to enable progressive learning, mitigating shortcut degradation and depth-width trade-off.

Result: Consistently outperforms residual models across image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling tasks.

Conclusion: StepsNet serves as a superior generalization of residual architecture, bridging the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models.

Abstract: Scaling up network depth is a fundamental pursuit in neural architecture design, as theory suggests that deeper models offer exponentially greater capability. Benefiting from the residual connections, modern neural networks can scale up to more than one hundred layers and enjoy wide success. However, as networks continue to deepen, current architectures often struggle to realize their theoretical capacity improvements, calling for more advanced designs to further unleash the potential of deeper networks. In this paper, we identify two key barriers that obstruct residual models from scaling deeper: shortcut degradation and limited width. Shortcut degradation hinders deep-layer learning, while the inherent depth-width trade-off imposes limited width. To mitigate these issues, we propose a generalized residual architecture dubbed Step by Step Network (StepsNet) to bridge the gap between theoretical potential and practical performance of deep models. Specifically, we separate features along the channel dimension and let the model learn progressively via stacking blocks with increasing width. The resulting method mitigates the two identified problems and serves as a versatile macro design applicable to various models. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms residual models across diverse tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and language modeling. These results position StepsNet as a superior generalization of the widely adopted residual architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchMap is a training-free framework for structured dental understanding from 3D intraoral scans, combining geometry-aware arch-flattening with a dental knowledge base for robust semantic interpretation without requiring annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for intraoral 3D scans rely on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled conditions, limiting generalization across devices and clinical deployment. Raw meshes have variable arch poses, incomplete geometry, and lack texture cues.

Method: ArchMap uses geometry-aware arch-flattening to standardize 3D meshes into aligned multi-view projections, and constructs a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain symbolic reasoning.

Result: Validated on 1060 orthodontic cases, ArchMap achieves robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and identifying clinical conditions like crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. It outperforms supervised pipelines and VLM baselines with higher accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning provides a practical, scalable solution for structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in digital orthodontics, without requiring training.

Abstract: A structured understanding of intraoral 3D scans is essential for digital orthodontics. However, existing deep-learning approaches rely heavily on modality-specific training, large annotated datasets, and controlled scanning conditions, which limit generalization across devices and hinder deployment in real clinical workflows. Moreover, raw intraoral meshes exhibit substantial variation in arch pose, incomplete geometry caused by occlusion or tooth contact, and a lack of texture cues, making unified semantic interpretation highly challenging. To address these limitations, we propose ArchMap, a training-free and knowledge-guided framework for robust structured dental understanding. ArchMap first introduces a geometry-aware arch-flattening module that standardizes raw 3D meshes into spatially aligned, continuity-preserving multi-view projections. We then construct a Dental Knowledge Base (DKB) encoding hierarchical tooth ontology, dentition-stage policies, and clinical semantics to constrain the symbolic reasoning space. We validate ArchMap on 1060 pre-/post-orthodontic cases, demonstrating robust performance in tooth counting, anatomical partitioning, dentition-stage classification, and the identification of clinical conditions such as crowding, missing teeth, prosthetics, and caries. Compared with supervised pipelines and prompted VLM baselines, ArchMap achieves higher accuracy, reduced semantic drift, and superior stability under sparse or artifact-prone conditions. As a fully training-free system, ArchMap demonstrates that combining geometric normalization with ontology-guided multimodal reasoning offers a practical and scalable solution for the structured analysis of 3D intraoral scans in modern digital orthodontics.

TL;DR: DentalSCR is a contour-guided framework for reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scans and lateral cephalometric radiographs, addressing challenges like projective magnification and low contrast that hinder conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle with real clinical cephalograms due to projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation, leading to convergence failures or implausible alignments.

Method: Proposes U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) for unified anatomical coordinate system, generates radiograph-like projections via surface-based DRR with Gaussian splatting, and uses symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance with hierarchical coarse-to-fine optimization for 2D similarity transform.

Result: Evaluation on 34 clinical cases shows substantial reductions in landmark error (especially at posterior teeth), tighter dispersion on lower jaw, and low Chamfer/controlled Hausdorff distances at curve level, outperforming conventional baselines.

Conclusion: DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D-2D alignment, providing a stable and interpretable solution for orthodontic diagnosis.

Abstract: Reliable 3D-2D alignment between intraoral scan (IOS) models and lateral cephalometric radiographs is critical for orthodontic diagnosis, yet conventional intensity-driven registration methods struggle under real clinical conditions, where cephalograms exhibit projective magnification, geometric distortion, low-contrast dental crowns, and acquisition-dependent variation. These factors hinder the stability of appearance-based similarity metrics and often lead to convergence failures or anatomically implausible alignments. To address these limitations, we propose DentalSCR, a pose-stable, contour-guided framework for accurate and interpretable silhouette-to-contour registration. Our method first constructs a U-Midline Dental Axis (UMDA) to establish a unified cross-arch anatomical coordinate system, thereby stabilizing initialization and standardizing projection geometry across cases. Using this reference frame, we generate radiograph-like projections via a surface-based DRR formulation with coronal-axis perspective and Gaussian splatting, which preserves clinical source-object-detector magnification and emphasizes external silhouettes. Registration is then formulated as a 2D similarity transform optimized with a symmetric bidirectional Chamfer distance under a hierarchical coarse-to-fine schedule, enabling both large capture range and subpixel-level contour agreement. We evaluate DentalSCR on 34 expert-annotated clinical cases. Experimental results demonstrate substantial reductions in landmark error-particularly at posterior teeth-tighter dispersion on the lower jaw, and low Chamfer and controlled Hausdorff distances at the curve level. These findings indicate that DentalSCR robustly handles real-world cephalograms and delivers high-fidelity, clinically inspectable 3D--2D alignment, outperforming conventional baselines.

Conclusion: ARC-Chapter demonstrates clear performance improvements through data scaling in both volume and label intensity, with the large-scale training approach enabling superior generalization and transferability for long video chaptering tasks.

Abstract: The proliferation of hour-long videos (e.g., lectures, podcasts, documentaries) has intensified demand for efficient content structuring. However, existing approaches are constrained by small-scale training with annotations that are typical short and coarse, restricting generalization to nuanced transitions in long videos. We introduce ARC-Chapter, the first large-scale video chaptering model trained on over million-level long video chapters, featuring bilingual, temporally grounded, and hierarchical chapter annotations. To achieve this goal, we curated a bilingual English-Chinese chapter dataset via a structured pipeline that unifies ASR transcripts, scene texts, visual captions into multi-level annotations, from short title to long summaries. We demonstrate clear performance improvements with data scaling, both in data volume and label intensity. Moreover, we design a new evaluation metric termed GRACE, which incorporates many-to-one segment overlaps and semantic similarity, better reflecting real-world chaptering flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARC-Chapter establishes a new state-of-the-art by a significant margin, outperforming the previous best by 14.0% in F1 score and 11.3% in SODA score. Moreover, ARC-Chapter shows excellent transferability, improving the state-of-the-art on downstream tasks like dense video captioning on YouCook2.

TL;DR: Image-Based Gaussian Splatting improves 3DGS by using source images for fine details and view-dependent effects without increasing storage costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with spatially varying colors and view-dependent effects due to limited spherical harmonics, while existing texture-based solutions have scalability or storage issues.

Method: Combines standard 3DGS base color with learned residuals from neighboring training images, enabling high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects.

Result: Significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality on standard novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method provides superior rendering quality for complex scenes and view-dependent effects while maintaining the same storage footprint as standard 3DGS.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a fast, high-quality method for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, its use of low-degree spherical harmonics limits its ability to capture spatially varying color and view-dependent effects such as specular highlights. Existing works augment Gaussians with either a global texture map, which struggles with complex scenes, or per-Gaussian texture maps, which introduces high storage overhead. We propose Image-Based Gaussian Splatting, an efficient alternative that leverages high-resolution source images for fine details and view-specific color modeling. Specifically, we model each pixel color as a combination of a base color from standard 3DGS rendering and a learned residual inferred from neighboring training images. This promotes accurate surface alignment and enables rendering images of high-frequency details and accurate view-dependent effects. Experiments on standard NVS benchmarks show that our method significantly outperforms prior Gaussian Splatting approaches in rendering quality, without increasing the storage footprint.

Bapp's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, including Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, with results demonstrating 98.4% precision, 96.9% recall, and an overall accuracy of 98.3%. These outcomes confirm the reliability of Bapp as a portable, accessible, and objective tool for monitoring both normal and abnormal eyelid movements. The application offers a promising alternative to traditional manual blink counting, supporting continuous ocular health monitoring and postoperative evaluation in clinical environments.

TL;DR: JFD3 is an end-to-end framework that jointly performs feature-domain deblurring and detection for infrared UAV images, using a dual-branch architecture with shared weights where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative features for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared UAV target images suffer from motion blur that reduces contrast between target and background. Existing methods treat deblurring as preprocessing focused on visual quality, neglecting enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection.

Method: Dual-branch architecture with shared weights; lightweight feature restoration network using clear branch features as supervision; frequency structure guidance module; feature consistency self-supervised loss between branches.

Result: JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency on the IRBlurUAV benchmark containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images.

Conclusion: The proposed joint feature-domain deblurring and detection framework effectively enhances discriminative feature representation for detection under blur conditions, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) target images often suffer from motion blur degradation caused by rapid sensor movement, significantly reducing contrast between target and background. Generally, detection performance heavily depends on the discriminative feature representation between target and background. Existing methods typically treat deblurring as a preprocessing step focused on visual quality, while neglecting the enhancement of task-relevant features crucial for detection. Improving feature representation for detection under blur conditions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel Joint Feature-Domain Deblurring and Detection end-to-end framework, dubbed JFD3. We design a dual-branch architecture with shared weights, where the clear branch guides the blurred branch to enhance discriminative feature representation. Specifically, we first introduce a lightweight feature restoration network, where features from the clear branch serve as feature-level supervision to guide the blurred branch, thereby enhancing its distinctive capability for detection. We then propose a frequency structure guidance module that refines the structure prior from the restoration network and integrates it into shallow detection layers to enrich target structural information. Finally, a feature consistency self-supervised loss is imposed between the dual-branch detection backbones, driving the blurred branch to approximate the feature representations of the clear one. Wealso construct a benchmark, named IRBlurUAV, containing 30,000 simulated and 4,118 real infrared UAV target images with diverse motion blur. Extensive experiments on IRBlurUAV demonstrate that JFD3 achieves superior detection performance while maintaining real-time efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in automated quantitative methods for evaluating shoulder pose compliance in biometric identity documents as mandated by international standards.

Method: Quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks from pose estimation frameworks, evaluated on 121 portrait images.

Result: SPE scores showed strong correlation (r ≈ 0.80) with human labels and effectively identified non-compliant samples using Error-versus-Discard analysis.

Conclusion: The SPE algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in biometric enrollment systems.

Abstract: International standards for biometric identity documents mandate strict compliance with pose requirements, including the square presentation of a subject's shoulders. However, the literature on automated quality assessment offers few quantitative methods for evaluating this specific attribute. This paper proposes a Shoulder Presentation Evaluation (SPE) algorithm to address this gap. The method quantifies shoulder yaw and roll using only the 3D coordinates of two shoulder landmarks provided by common pose estimation frameworks. The algorithm was evaluated on a dataset of 121 portrait images. The resulting SPE scores demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation (r approx. 0.80) with human-assigned labels. An analysis of the metric's filtering performance, using an adapted Error-versus-Discard methodology, confirmed its utility in identifying non-compliant samples. The proposed algorithm is a viable lightweight tool for automated compliance checking in enrolment systems.

TL;DR: First texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models using 3D PAEs with global camouflage texture for autonomous driving systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attacks mostly target monocular perception with 2D patches, leaving stereo-based binocular depth estimation largely unexplored despite its importance in autonomous driving.

Method: Proposes 3D PAE with global camouflage texture, 3D stereo matching rendering module for real-world alignment, and novel merging attack for seamless background integration through fine-grained optimization.

Result: Extensive evaluations show PAEs successfully fool stereo models into producing erroneous depth information with enhanced stealth and lethality compared to existing hiding attacks.

Conclusion: The proposed method demonstrates effective physical adversarial attacks against stereo matching models, highlighting vulnerabilities in autonomous driving perception systems.

Abstract: Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.

Result: Evaluation on LangAuto benchmark in CARLA showed relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions.

Conclusion: TLS-Assist effectively enhances LLM-based autonomous driving agents by providing explicit traffic rule enforcement and improving detection of safety-critical objects, leading to better driving performance and reduced violations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making and planning in autonomous driving, showing promising reasoning capabilities and potential to generalize across diverse traffic situations. However, current LLM-based driving agents lack explicit mechanisms to enforce traffic rules and often struggle to reliably detect small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights and signs. To address this limitation, we introduce TLS-Assist, a modular redundancy layer that augments LLM-based autonomous driving agents with explicit traffic light and sign recognition. TLS-Assist converts detections into structured natural language messages that are injected into the LLM input, enforcing explicit attention to safety-critical cues. The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and supports both single-view and multi-view camera setups. We evaluate TLS-Assist in a closed-loop setup on the LangAuto benchmark in CARLA. The results demonstrate relative driving performance improvements of up to 14% over LMDrive and 7% over BEVDriver, while consistently reducing traffic light and sign infractions. We publicly release the code and models on https://github.com/iis-esslingen/TLS-Assist.

Motivation: Traditional methods estimate human motion in image coordinates, but many applications require world coordinate estimation, which is challenging with both human and camera motion. Progress has been limited by lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement.

Method: Created BEDLAM2.0 dataset that expands on BEDLAM with more diverse and realistic cameras/camera motions, increased diversity in body shape, motions, clothing, hair, 3D environments, and added shoes that were missing in the original dataset.

Conclusion: BEDLAM2.0 provides a superior dataset for training 3D human pose and motion regressors, particularly for world coordinate estimation, and includes rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, camera motions, and 3D assets for research purposes.

Abstract: Inferring 3D human motion from video remains a challenging problem with many applications. While traditional methods estimate the human in image coordinates, many applications require human motion to be estimated in world coordinates. This is particularly challenging when there is both human and camera motion. Progress on this topic has been limited by the lack of rich video data with ground truth human and camera movement. We address this with BEDLAM2.0, a new dataset that goes beyond the popular BEDLAM dataset in important ways. In addition to introducing more diverse and realistic cameras and camera motions, BEDLAM2.0 increases diversity and realism of body shape, motions, clothing, hair, and 3D environments. Additionally, it adds shoes, which were missing in BEDLAM. BEDLAM has become a key resource for training 3D human pose and motion regressors today and we show that BEDLAM2.0 is significantly better, particularly for training methods that estimate humans in world coordinates. We compare state-of-the art methods trained on BEDLAM and BEDLAM2.0, and find that BEDLAM2.0 significantly improves accuracy over BEDLAM. For research purposes, we provide the rendered videos, ground truth body parameters, and camera motions. We also provide the 3D assets to which we have rights and links to those from third parties.

### [144] [Language as an Anchor: Preserving Relative Visual Geometry for Domain Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14401)
*Shuyi Geng,Tao Zhou,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LAVA addresses Domain Incremental Learning challenges by using language anchors for relative visual alignment instead of direct feature alignment, preventing inter-domain interference and knowledge fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DIL methods face a dilemma: unified visual spaces cause inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, while isolated domain-specific parameters create knowledge islands that hamper knowledge reuse and cause forgetting.

Method: LAVA uses Language-Anchored Visual Alignment, replacing direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by text-based reference anchors. It preserves consistent relative geometry by mirroring pairwise semantic similarities between class names.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks show LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LAVA's anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation in Domain Incremental Learning.

Abstract: A key challenge in Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is to continually learn under shifting distributions while preserving knowledge from previous domains. Existing methods face a fundamental dilemma. On one hand, projecting all domains into a single unified visual space leads to inter-domain interference and semantic distortion, as large shifts may vary with not only visual appearance but also underlying semantics. On the other hand, isolating domain-specific parameters causes knowledge fragmentation, creating "knowledge islands" that hamper knowledge reuse and exacerbate forgetting. To address this issue, we propose LAVA (Language-Anchored Visual Alignment), a novel DIL framework that replaces direct feature alignment with relative alignment driven by a text-based reference anchor. LAVA guides the visual representations of each incoming domain to preserve a consistent relative geometry, which is defined by mirroring the pairwise semantic similarities between the class names. This anchored geometric structure acts as a bridge across domains, enabling the retrieval of class-aware prior knowledge and facilitating robust feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on standard DIL benchmarks demonstrate that LAVA achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/ShuyiGeng/LAVA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cranio-ID: A novel framework for automatic craniometric landmark annotation and cross-modal matching between skull X-rays and optical face images using YOLO-pose models and graph-based semantic correspondence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional craniometric landmark localization methods are time-consuming and require expertise, while current automatic methods lack reliability due to insufficient validation.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Automatic landmark annotation on 2D skull X-rays using trained YOLO-pose models, 2) Cross-modal matching by converting landmarks to graph representations and finding semantic correspondence using cross-attention and optimal transport.

Result: Extensive experiments on S2F and CUHK datasets show significant improvements in reliability and accuracy for skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic applications.

Conclusion: The proposed Cranio-ID framework demonstrates effectiveness in cross-domain forensic identification tasks, providing more reliable and accurate craniometric landmark analysis compared to existing methods.

Abstract: In forensic craniofacial identification and in many biomedical applications, craniometric landmarks are important. Traditional methods for locating landmarks are time-consuming and require specialized knowledge and expertise. Current methods utilize superimposition and deep learning-based methods that employ automatic annotation of landmarks. However, these methods are not reliable due to insufficient large-scale validation studies. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework Cranio-ID: First, an automatic annotation of landmarks on 2D skulls (which are X-ray scans of faces) with their respective optical images using our trained YOLO-pose models. Second, cross-modal matching by formulating these landmarks into graph representations and then finding semantic correspondence between graphs of these two modalities using cross-attention and optimal transport framework. Our proposed framework is validated on the S2F and CUHK datasets (CUHK dataset resembles with S2F dataset). Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed framework, which demonstrates significant improvements in both reliability and accuracy, as well as its effectiveness in cross-domain skull-to-face and sketch-to-face matching in forensic science.

TL;DR: Training self-supervised learning models with infant-like visual constraints (CATDiet) enhances robustness and produces biologically aligned developmental patterns, suggesting infant visual development provides a framework for building robust AI vision systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the ecological advantages of staged "visual diets" that mimic infant vision development, and understand how such developmental progression can inform robust visual intelligence in machines.

Method: Train SSL models on object-centric videos under CATDiet constraints: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T). Also develop CombDiet which initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training.

Result: CATDiet variants show enhanced robustness in object recognition across 10 datasets and exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns. CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception.

Conclusion: The developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines.

Abstract: Newborns perceive the world with low-acuity, color-degraded, and temporally continuous vision, which gradually sharpens as infants develop. To explore the ecological advantages of such staged "visual diets", we train self-supervised learning (SSL) models on object-centric videos under constraints that simulate infant vision: grayscale-to-color (C), blur-to-sharp (A), and preserved temporal continuity (T)-collectively termed CATDiet. For evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark across ten datasets, covering clean and corrupted image recognition, texture-shape cue conflict tests, silhouette recognition, depth-order classification, and the visual cliff paradigm. All CATDiet variants demonstrate enhanced robustness in object recognition, despite being trained solely on object-centric videos. Remarkably, models also exhibit biologically aligned developmental patterns, including neural plasticity changes mirroring synaptic density in macaque V1 and behaviors resembling infants' visual cliff responses. Building on these insights, CombDiet initializes SSL with CATDiet before standard training while preserving temporal continuity. Trained on object-centric or head-mounted infant videos, CombDiet outperforms standard SSL on both in-domain and out-of-domain object recognition and depth perception. Together, these results suggest that the developmental progression of early infant visual experience offers a powerful reverse-engineering framework for understanding the emergence of robust visual intelligence in machines. All code, data, and models will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs process videos in single-pass with limited evidence revisit, while agent-based methods rely on expensive proprietary models or extensive RL training. AVI aims to overcome these limitations through system-level design.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) Retrieve-Perceive-Review reasoning process for global exploration and local analysis, (2) structured video knowledge base with entity graphs and multi-granularity tools, (3) open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight CV models and VLM.

Result: Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA show competitive performance with superior interpretability.

Conclusion: AVI provides a flexible, training-free framework for complex video reasoning that achieves strong results while eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training.

Abstract: Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.

Abstract: Low-light video deblurring poses significant challenges in applications like nighttime surveillance and autonomous driving due to dim lighting and long exposures. While event cameras offer potential solutions with superior low-light sensitivity and high temporal resolution, existing fusion methods typically employ staged strategies, limiting their effectiveness against combined low-light and motion blur degradations.

TL;DR: A physics-guided deep learning framework for predicting subglacial bed topography using residual learning over prior estimates, achieving better accuracy and physical plausibility than baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate subglacial bed topography is crucial for ice sheet modeling, but radar observations are sparse and unevenly distributed, requiring methods that can generalize well with limited data.

Method: DeepLabV3+ decoder with ResNet-50 encoder trained with physics constraints including multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity, prior consistency, and masked Huber fit to radar data with confidence weighting.

Result: Outperformed U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and plain CNN across two Greenland regions with strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity using leakage-safe blockwise hold-out validation.

Conclusion: The residual-over-prior design combined with physics constraints produces spatially coherent, physically plausible bed topography suitable for operational mapping under domain shift conditions.

Abstract: Accurate subglacial bed topography is essential for ice sheet modeling, yet radar observations are sparse and uneven. We propose a physics-guided residual learning framework that predicts bed thickness residuals over a BedMachine prior and reconstructs bed from the observed surface. A DeepLabV3+ decoder over a standard encoder (e.g.,ResNet-50) is trained with lightweight physics and data terms: multi-scale mass conservation, flow-aligned total variation, Laplacian damping, non-negativity of thickness, a ramped prior-consistency term, and a masked Huber fit to radar picks modulated by a confidence map. To measure real-world generalization, we adopt leakage-safe blockwise hold-outs (vertical/horizontal) with safety buffers and report metrics only on held-out cores. Across two Greenland sub-regions, our approach achieves strong test-core accuracy and high structural fidelity, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, FPN, and a plain CNN. The residual-over-prior design, combined with physics, yields spatially coherent, physically plausible beds suitable for operational mapping under domain shift.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve efficiency in computer vision tasks by eliminating the need for iterative transport plan computation during training, which is common in conventional optimal transport methods.

Method: Proposes a Gaussian splatting-based approach to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence and compute transport plan using Bayesian probability, then derives a loss function for network optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on crowd counting and landmark detection show GST's effectiveness while significantly improving training efficiency compared to conventional optimal transport schemes.

Conclusion: GST provides an efficient framework for spatial transport in computer vision tasks by leveraging Gaussian splatting, eliminating iterative computations during training while maintaining performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gaussian Spatial Transport (GST), a novel framework that leverages Gaussian splatting to facilitate transport from the probability measure in the image coordinate space to the annotation map. We propose a Gaussian splatting-based method to estimate pixel-annotation correspondence, which is then used to compute a transport plan derived from Bayesian probability. To integrate the resulting transport plan into standard network optimization in typical computer vision tasks, we derive a loss function that measures discrepancy after transport. Extensive experiments on representative computer vision tasks, including crowd counting and landmark detection, validate the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to conventional optimal transport schemes, GST eliminates iterative transport plan computation during training, significantly improving efficiency.

TL;DR: SEED-SR is a novel approach that performs super-resolution in segmentation-aware latent space using conditional latent diffusion models and geo-spatial foundation models, enabling 20x scale factor for farm boundary delineation in agricultural monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of frequent monitoring of smallholder farms using high-resolution satellite imagery (available annually) combined with low-resolution imagery (available weekly), overcoming limitations of current Ref-SR methods that optimize perceptual quality but smooth crucial features needed for segmentation tasks.

Method: Uses conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models to bypass explicit super-resolution in pixel space and instead perform SR in segmentation-aware latent space.

Result: Achieves unprecedented 20x scale factor for generating segmentation maps, with 25.5% relative improvement in instance segmentation and 12.9% relative improvement in semantic segmentation metrics over state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods on two large real datasets.

Conclusion: SEED-SR provides an effective solution for combining high and low resolution satellite imagery for agricultural monitoring, significantly outperforming existing approaches by focusing on segmentation-aware super-resolution rather than perceptual quality.

Abstract: Delineating farm boundaries through segmentation of satellite images is a fundamental step in many agricultural applications. The task is particularly challenging for smallholder farms, where accurate delineation requires the use of high resolution (HR) imagery which are available only at low revisit frequencies (e.g., annually). To support more frequent (sub-) seasonal monitoring, HR images could be combined as references (ref) with low resolution (LR) images -- having higher revisit frequency (e.g., weekly) -- using reference-based super-resolution (Ref-SR) methods. However, current Ref-SR methods optimize perceptual quality and smooth over crucial features needed for downstream tasks, and are unable to meet the large scale-factor requirements for this task. Further, previous two-step approaches of SR followed by segmentation do not effectively utilize diverse satellite sources as inputs. We address these problems through a new approach, $\textbf{SEED-SR}$, which uses a combination of conditional latent diffusion models and large-scale multi-spectral, multi-source geo-spatial foundation models. Our key innovation is to bypass the explicit SR task in the pixel space and instead perform SR in a segmentation-aware latent space. This unique approach enables us to generate segmentation maps at an unprecedented 20$\times$ scale factor, and rigorous experiments on two large, real datasets demonstrate up to $\textbf{25.5}$ and $\textbf{12.9}$ relative improvement in instance and semantic segmentation metrics respectively over approaches based on state-of-the-art Ref-SR methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in autonomous driving generalization and inconsistencies in hybrid systems, while avoiding computational demands of end-to-end VLA frameworks.

Method: Introduces Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD) with RiskHead module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View features to create interpretable risk-attention maps.

Result: Significant improvement in perception and planning capabilities on Bench2Drive benchmark, with enhanced ability to handle complex and unpredictable driving conditions.

Conclusion: RSD effectively enhances BEV representations for better generalization in autonomous driving, aligning with human-like driving behavior through risk attention learning.

Abstract: The autonomous driving (AD) system has exhibited remarkable performance in complex driving scenarios. However, generalization is still a key limitation for the current system, which refers to the ability to handle unseen scenarios or unfamiliar sensor configurations.Related works have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to address few-shot or zero-shot tasks. While promising, these methods introduce a new challenge: the emergence of a hybrid AD system, where two distinct systems are used to plan a trajectory, leading to potential inconsistencies. Alternative research directions have explored Vision-Language-Action (VLA) frameworks that generate control actions from VLM directly. However, these end-to-end solutions demonstrate prohibitive computational demands. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Risk Semantic Distillation (RSD), a novel framework that leverages VLMs to enhance the training of End-to-End (E2E) AD backbones. By providing risk attention for key objects, RSD addresses the issue of generalization. Specifically, we introduce RiskHead, a plug-in module that distills causal risk estimates from Vision-Language Models into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features, yielding interpretable risk-attention maps.This approach allows BEV features to learn richer and more nuanced risk attention representations, which directly enhance the model's ability to handle spatial boundaries and risky objects.By focusing on risk attention, RSD aligns better with human-like driving behavior, which is essential to navigate in complex and dynamic environments. Our experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of RSD in managing complex and unpredictable driving conditions. Due to the enhanced BEV representations enabled by RSD, we observed a significant improvement in both perception and planning capabilities.

Motivation: Existing methods use convolutions and attention for task interactions, but PAMM aims to better capture task inter-relations using state space models' rich parameters for improved multi-task dense prediction.

Method: Uses dual state space parameter experts to integrate task-specific priors, structured state space sequence model (S4) for global integration, and Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning for 2D feature sequence construction.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in multi-task dense prediction.

Conclusion: PAMM provides an effective framework for multi-task dense prediction by leveraging state space models to enhance task interconnectivity and perception capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the inter-relations and interactions between tasks is crucial for multi-task dense prediction. Existing methods predominantly utilize convolutional layers and attention mechanisms to explore task-level interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel decoder-based framework, Parameter Aware Mamba Model (PAMM), specifically designed for dense prediction in multi-task learning setting. Distinct from approaches that employ Transformers to model holistic task relationships, PAMM leverages the rich, scalable parameters of state space models to enhance task interconnectivity. It features dual state space parameter experts that integrate and set task-specific parameter priors, capturing the intrinsic properties of each task. This approach not only facilitates precise multi-task interactions but also allows for the global integration of task priors through the structured state space sequence model (S4). Furthermore, we employ the Multi-Directional Hilbert Scanning method to construct multi-angle feature sequences, thereby enhancing the sequence model's perceptual capabilities for 2D data. Extensive experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/CQC-gogopro/PAMM.

TL;DR: D-PerceptCT is a novel LDCT enhancement method inspired by Human Visual System principles, using semantic-aware feature extraction and global-local processing to preserve diagnostically important details while reducing noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LDCT enhancement methods often over-smooth images and lose critical diagnostic details. The goal is to enhance perceptually relevant features to help radiologists better identify anatomical structures and pathological details.

Method: Uses Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex) with DINOv2 semantic priors and Global-Local State-Space block for long-range information capture. Also introduces Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF) based on human contrast sensitivity.

Result: Extensive experiments on Mayo2016 dataset show D-PerceptCT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving structural and textural information in LDCT images.

Conclusion: D-PerceptCT effectively enhances LDCT images by preserving perceptually important diagnostic features through HVS-inspired architecture and perceptual loss functions.

Abstract: Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is widely used as an imaging solution to aid diagnosis and other clinical tasks. However, this comes at the price of a deterioration in image quality due to the low dose of radiation used to reduce the risk of secondary cancer development. While some efficient methods have been proposed to enhance LDCT quality, many overestimate noise and perform excessive smoothing, leading to a loss of critical details. In this paper, we introduce D-PerceptCT, a novel architecture inspired by key principles of the Human Visual System (HVS) to enhance LDCT images. The objective is to guide the model to enhance or preserve perceptually relevant features, thereby providing radiologists with CT images where critical anatomical structures and fine pathological details are perceptu- ally visible. D-PerceptCT consists of two main blocks: 1) a Visual Dual-path Extractor (ViDex), which integrates semantic priors from a pretrained DINOv2 model with local spatial features, allowing the network to incorporate semantic-awareness during enhancement; (2) a Global-Local State-Space block that captures long-range information and multiscale features to preserve the important structures and fine details for diagnosis. In addition, we propose a novel deep perceptual loss, designated as the Deep Perceptual Relevancy Loss Function (DPRLF), which is inspired by human contrast sensitivity, to further emphasize perceptually important features. Extensive experiments on the Mayo2016 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of D-PerceptCT method for LDCT enhancement, showing better preservation of structural and textural information within LDCT images compared to SOTA methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning methods are constrained by scarce high-quality paired datasets, as obtaining pristine reference labels in underwater scenes is difficult. Existing benchmarks use manually selected results that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision.

Method: Established a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset covering 6 representative underwater degradation types. Uses in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translates them into underwater-degraded versions.

Result: Models trained on the synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks across 6 network architectures and 3 independent test sets.

Conclusion: Provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement, with the generated dataset publicly available for research use.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration and enhancement are crucial for correcting color distortion and restoring image details, thereby establishing a fundamental basis for subsequent underwater visual tasks. However, current deep learning methodologies in this area are frequently constrained by the scarcity of high-quality paired datasets. Since it is difficult to obtain pristine reference labels in underwater scenes, existing benchmarks often rely on manually selected results from enhancement algorithms, providing debatable reference images that lack globally consistent color and authentic supervision. This limits the model's capabilities in color restoration, image enhancement, and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose using in-air natural images as unambiguous reference targets and translating them into underwater-degraded versions, thereby constructing synthetic datasets that provide authentic supervision signals for model learning. Specifically, we establish a generative data framework based on unpaired image-to-image translation, producing a large-scale dataset that covers 6 representative underwater degradation types. The framework constructs synthetic datasets with precise ground-truth labels, which facilitate the learning of an accurate mapping from degraded underwater images to their pristine scene appearances. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments across 6 representative network architectures and 3 independent test sets show that models trained on our synthetic data achieve comparable or superior color restoration and generalization performance to those trained on existing benchmarks. This research provides a reliable and scalable data-driven solution for underwater image restoration and enhancement.

*Xiangchen Yin,Jiahui Yuan,Zhangchi Hu,Wenzhang Sun,Jie Chen,Xiaozhen Qiao,Hao Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCo-VAE proposes a decoupled VAE that separates video content into keyframe, motion, and residual components with dedicated encoders to reduce redundancy and achieve compact latent representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video VAEs overlook frame content similarity, leading to redundant latent modeling and inefficient representation of video data.

Method: Decompose video into keyframe, motion, and residual components; use dedicated encoders for each component with shared 3D decoder; employ decoupled adaptation strategy with sequential training of partial encoders.

Result: Achieves superior video reconstruction performance compared to existing methods, as demonstrated through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Conclusion: DeCo-VAE effectively addresses redundancy in video VAEs through explicit decoupling and dedicated component modeling, resulting in compact latent representations and improved reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Existing video Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) generally overlook the similarity between frame contents, leading to redundant latent modeling. In this paper, we propose decoupled VAE (DeCo-VAE) to achieve compact latent representation. Instead of encoding RGB pixels directly, we decompose video content into distinct components via explicit decoupling: keyframe, motion and residual, and learn dedicated latent representation for each. To avoid cross-component interference, we design dedicated encoders for each decoupled component and adopt a shared 3D decoder to maintain spatiotemporal consistency during reconstruction. We further utilize a decoupled adaptation strategy that freezes partial encoders while training the others sequentially, ensuring stable training and accurate learning of both static and dynamic features. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DeCo-VAE achieves superior video reconstruction performance.

### [158] [Learning Compact Latent Space for Representing Neural Signed Distance Functions with High-fidelity Geometry Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14539)
*Qiang Bai,Bojian Wu,Xi Yang,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to represent multiple signed distance functions (SDFs) in a common space that preserves high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes by combining generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural SDFs work well for single shapes/scenes but struggle with multiple SDFs due to limited latent space information and loss of geometry details.

Method: Combines generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies with a novel sampling strategy to improve training efficiency and eliminate artifacts from other SDFs.

Result: Achieves better representative ability and compactness compared to latest methods, validated through numerical and visual evaluations on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes limitations of existing SDF representations for multiple shapes by preserving high-fidelity details with compact latent codes.

Abstract: Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have been a vital representation to represent 3D shapes or scenes with neural networks. An SDF is an implicit function that can query signed distances at specific coordinates for recovering a 3D surface. Although implicit functions work well on a single shape or scene, they pose obstacles when analyzing multiple SDFs with high-fidelity geometry details, due to the limited information encoded in the latent space for SDFs and the loss of geometry details. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a method to represent multiple SDFs in a common space, aiming to recover more high-fidelity geometry details with more compact latent representations. Our key idea is to take full advantage of the benefits of generalization-based and overfitting-based learning strategies, which manage to preserve high-fidelity geometry details with compact latent codes. Based on this framework, we also introduce a novel sampling strategy to sample training queries. The sampling can improve the training efficiency and eliminate artifacts caused by the influence of other SDFs. We report numerical and visual evaluations on widely used benchmarks to validate our designs and show advantages over the latest methods in terms of the representative ability and compactness.

*Hao Tian,Chenyangguang Zhang,Rui Liu,Wen Shen,Xiaolin Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for modeling hand-object interaction scenes without object priors using dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing occlusion, edge blur, and motion challenges through interaction-aware Gaussians and progressive optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model complex hand-object interactions with mutual occlusion and edge blur without relying on object priors, addressing challenges in dynamic scene reconstruction.

Method: Uses interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with optimizable parameters for structural representation, incorporates hand information into object deformation fields, and employs progressive optimization with explicit regularizations for stable motion and physical interaction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interactions, surpassing existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles complex hand-object interactions with improved structural representation and motion modeling, demonstrating superior reconstruction quality.

Abstract: This paper focuses on a challenging setting of simultaneously modeling geometry and appearance of hand-object interaction scenes without any object priors. We follow the trend of dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting based methods, and address several significant challenges. To model complex hand-object interaction with mutual occlusion and edge blur, we present interaction-aware hand-object Gaussians with newly introduced optimizable parameters aiming to adopt piecewise linear hypothesis for clearer structural representation. Moreover, considering the complementarity and tightness of hand shape and object shape during interaction dynamics, we incorporate hand information into object deformation field, constructing interaction-aware dynamic fields to model flexible motions. To further address difficulties in the optimization process, we propose a progressive strategy that handles dynamic regions and static background step by step. Correspondingly, explicit regularizations are designed to stabilize the hand-object representations for smooth motion transition, physical interaction reality, and coherent lighting. Experiments show that our approach surpasses existing dynamic 3D-GS-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing dynamic hand-object interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders threaten information integrity, and single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains.

Method: Uses three branches: RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) for global visual inconsistencies, texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) for fine-grained blending artifacts, and frequency branch (CNN + SE) for spectral noise. Includes attention-based temporal pooling and adaptive attention fusion.

Result: Achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208 on Celeb-DF (v2), outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation studies validate branch synergy.

Conclusion: The comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries, with Grad-CAM confirming forensic focus on relevant artifacts.

Abstract: Deepfakes generated by advanced GANs and autoencoders severely threaten information integrity and societal stability. Single-stream CNNs fail to capture multi-scale forgery artifacts across spatial, texture, and frequency domains, limiting robustness and generalization. We introduce the ForensicFlow, a tri-modal forensic framework that synergistically fuses RGB, texture, and frequency evidence for video Deepfake detection. The RGB branch (ConvNeXt-tiny) extracts global visual inconsistencies; the texture branch (Swin Transformer-tiny) detects fine-grained blending artifacts; the frequency branch (CNN + SE) identifies periodic spectral noise. Attention-based temporal pooling dynamically prioritizes high-evidence frames, while adaptive attention fusion balances branch contributions.Trained on Celeb-DF (v2) with Focal Loss, ForensicFlow achieves AUC 0.9752, F1-Score 0.9408, and accuracy 0.9208, outperforming single-stream baselines. Ablation validates branch synergy; Grad-CAM confirms forensic focus. This comprehensive feature fusion provides superior resilience against subtle forgeries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models that reveals global model behavior and fine-grained information, unlike traditional saliency map methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide better understanding of CNN models in digital pathology by showing global behavior rather than just single-slide saliency, increasing clinical confidence and adoption.

Method: Clustering-based explainability technique that visualizes model behavior patterns across multiple samples, providing both global and fine-grained insights.

Result: Successfully evaluated on a prostate cancer detection model, demonstrating usefulness in understanding model operations and increasing clinical confidence.

Conclusion: The clustering-based approach provides more comprehensive model explainability than traditional saliency methods, facilitating faster clinical adoption of AI pathology models.

Abstract: We present a clustering-based explainability technique for digital pathology models based on convolutional neural networks. Unlike commonly used methods based on saliency maps, such as occlusion, GradCAM, or relevance propagation, which highlight regions that contribute the most to the prediction for a single slide, our method shows the global behaviour of the model under consideration, while also providing more fine-grained information. The result clusters can be visualised not only to understand the model, but also to increase confidence in its operation, leading to faster adoption in clinical practice. We also evaluate the performance of our technique on an existing model for detecting prostate cancer, demonstrating its usefulness.

*Keda Tao,Kele Shao,Bohan Yu,Weiqiang Wang,Jian liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniZip is a training-free framework that uses audio guidance to compress audio-visual tokens in omnimodal LLMs, achieving 3.42X speedup and 1.4X memory reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Processing audio-video token sequences creates significant computational bottlenecks in omnimodal LLMs, and existing token compression methods don't address the need for joint multimodal token compression.

Method: OmniZip identifies salient audio tokens, computes audio retention scores per time group to capture information density, then dynamically guides video token pruning using cross-modal similarity. It compresses video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme.

Result: Achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing methods while maintaining performance without requiring training.

Conclusion: OmniZip effectively bridges the gap in multimodal token compression, providing significant computational efficiency gains for audio-video understanding in omnimodal LLMs.

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models (OmniLLMs) have attracted increasing research attention of late towards unified audio-video understanding, wherein processing audio-video token sequences creates a significant computational bottleneck, however. Existing token compression methods have yet to accommodate this emerging need of jointly compressing multimodal tokens. To bridge this gap, we present OmniZip, a training-free, audio-guided audio-visual token-compression framework that optimizes multimodal token representation and accelerates inference. Specifically, OmniZip first identifies salient audio tokens, then computes an audio retention score for each time group to capture information density, thereby dynamically guiding video token pruning and preserving cues from audio anchors enhanced by cross-modal similarity. For each time window, OmniZip compresses the video tokens using an interleaved spatio-temporal scheme. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the merits of OmniZip - it achieves 3.42X inference speedup and 1.4X memory reduction over other top-performing counterparts, while maintaining performance with no training.

### [163] [Deep Learning-Based Regional White Matter Hyperintensity Mapping as a Robust Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14588)
*Julia Machnio,Mads Nielsen,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework for white matter hyperintensity (WMH) segmentation and regional localization that outperforms global lesion burden for disease classification, especially when combined with brain atrophy metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most automated WMH segmentation methods only provide global lesion load and overlook spatial distribution across white matter regions, which may have diagnostic value in cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease.

Method: Deep learning framework for WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and ADNI cohort, with regional WMH quantification and integration with brain structure volumes.

Result: Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, reaching AUC values up to 0.97 when combined with atrophy metrics. Anterior white matter tracts show reproducible associations with diagnostic status.

Conclusion: Regional WMH quantification provides added diagnostic value over global measures, and incorporating localized lesion metrics with atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation framework for robust brain tumor segmentation that handles arbitrary missing MRI modalities through hierarchical and progressive self-distillation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world clinical MRI data often has missing modalities, which severely compromises deep learning segmentation models that rely on multi-modal integration.

Method: Shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture with hierarchical modality self-distillation and progressive modality combination distillation that simulates gradual modality dropout during training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on brain tumor segmentation benchmarks across various missing-modality scenarios with strong generalization and stability.

Conclusion: CCSD provides an effective solution for robust brain tumor segmentation in clinical settings with incomplete MRI data through cross-modal self-distillation.

Abstract: The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.

*Nathaniel Putera,Daniel Vilet Rodríguez,Noah Videcrantz,Julia Machnio,Mostafa Mehdipour Ghazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based MRI embeddings excel at identifying cognitively stable individuals while clinical features better predict severe Alzheimer's progression, suggesting complementary multimodal approaches are needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular predictors have limited ability to capture subtle brain changes in Alzheimer's disease, while imaging data may provide more sensitive biomarkers for early detection and progression modeling.

Method: Used Dynamic Time Warping clustering for trajectory-aware labeling, trained 3D Vision Transformer via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized MRI data, and compared transformer embeddings against tabular features and CNN baselines using various classifiers.

Result: Clinical features achieved AUC ~0.70 for predicting mild/severe progression, while ViT MRI embeddings achieved AUC 0.71 for distinguishing stable individuals. All methods struggled with moderate progression group.

Conclusion: Clinical features identify high-risk extremes effectively, transformer-based MRI embeddings detect subtle stability markers, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for comprehensive AD progression modeling.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.

Motivation: Poor bone health and osteoporosis are significant public health concerns, with low BMD increasing fracture risk. Current methods may not effectively integrate multimodal data for accurate BMD prediction.

Method: Uses bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate X-ray image features and clinical metadata, with a Weighted Smooth L1 loss function to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases.

Result: Outperforms baseline models in regression generalization and robustness, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing R2 score by 16.4% compared to naive feature concatenation without cross-attention.

Conclusion: The cross-attention fusion and customized loss function effectively improve BMD estimation, demonstrating potential for real-world screening applications at clinically relevant BMD thresholds.

Abstract: Poor bone health is a significant public health concern, and low bone mineral density (BMD) leads to an increased fracture risk, a key feature of osteoporosis. We present XAttn-BMD (Cross-Attention BMD), a multimodal deep learning framework that predicts femoral neck BMD from hip X-ray images and structured clinical metadata. It utilizes a novel bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to dynamically integrate image and metadata features for cross-modal mutual reinforcement. A Weighted Smooth L1 loss is tailored to address BMD imbalance and prioritize clinically significant cases. Extensive experiments on the data from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study show that our model outperforms the baseline models in regression generalization and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both cross-attention fusion and the customized loss function. Experimental results show that the integration of multimodal data via cross-attention outperforms naive feature concatenation without cross-attention, reducing MSE by 16.7%, MAE by 6.03%, and increasing the R2 score by 16.4%, highlighting the effectiveness of the approach for femoral neck BMD estimation. Furthermore, screening performance was evaluated using binary classification at clinically relevant femoral neck BMD thresholds, demonstrating the model's potential in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: HoloTea is a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E histology by leveraging information from adjacent tissue sections, enabling more accurate 3D spatial transcriptomics reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods treat tissue sections independently and ignore 3D structure, while 3D-aware approaches don't scale well and aren't generative. There's a need for scalable 3D tissue transcriptomics to better understand tissue organization and disease.

Method: Uses a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that retrieves morphologically corresponding spots in a shared feature space, fuses cross-section context via ControlNet, and employs a 3D-consistent prior combining learned ZINB with spatial-empirical priors from neighbors.

Result: Consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions compared to 2D and 3D baselines.

Conclusion: HoloTea advances creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, potentially accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening understanding of disease through improved 3D spatial transcriptomics reconstruction.

Abstract: A scalable and robust 3D tissue transcriptomics profile can enable a holistic understanding of tissue organization and provide deeper insights into human biology and disease. Most predictive algorithms that infer ST directly from histology treat each section independently and ignore 3D structure, while existing 3D-aware approaches are not generative and do not scale well. We present Holographic Tissue Expression Inpainting and Analysis (HoloTea), a 3D-aware flow-matching framework that imputes spot-level gene expression from H&E while explicitly using information from adjacent sections. Our key idea is to retrieve morphologically corresponding spots on neighboring slides in a shared feature space and fuse this cross section context into a lightweight ControlNet, allowing conditioning to follow anatomical continuity. To better capture the count nature of the data, we introduce a 3D-consistent prior for flow matching that combines a learned zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) prior with a spatial-empirical prior constructed from neighboring sections. A global attention block introduces 3D H&E scaling linearly with the number of spots in the slide, enabling training and inference on large 3D ST datasets. Across three spatial transcriptomics datasets spanning different tissue types and resolutions, HoloTea consistently improves 3D expression accuracy and generalization compared to 2D and 3D baselines. We envision HoloTea advancing the creation of accurate 3D virtual tissues, ultimately accelerating biomarker discovery and deepening our understanding of disease.

*Md Fokhrul Islam,Sajeda Al-Hammouri,Christopher J. Arellano,Kavan Hazeli,Heman Shakeri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BioST-GCN model combines pose and biomechanical data using cross-attention to predict falls, achieving 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score improvements over baseline on simulated data, but faces major simulation-reality gap with performance dropping to 35.9% on unseen subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Falls are a major cause of injury in older adults, but vision-based fall prediction systems are limited by scarce real fall data. The study aims to develop better fall prediction using biomechanical information.

Method: Proposed Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN) - a dual-stream model combining pose and biomechanical information with cross-attention fusion mechanism.

Result: Model outperforms baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on simulated datasets, achieves 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, but zero-shot generalization drops to 35.9% on unseen subjects due to simulation-reality gap.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need to bridge the simulation-reality gap through personalization strategies and privacy-preserving data pipelines for effective real-world fall prediction systems for elderly populations.

Abstract: Falls are a leading cause of injury and loss of independence among older adults. Vision-based fall prediction systems offer a non-invasive solution to anticipate falls seconds before impact, but their development is hindered by the scarcity of available fall data. Contributing to these efforts, this study proposes the Biomechanical Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (BioST-GCN), a dual-stream model that combines both pose and biomechanical information using a cross-attention fusion mechanism. Our model outperforms the vanilla ST-GCN baseline by 5.32% and 2.91% F1-score on the simulated MCF-UA stunt-actor and MUVIM datasets, respectively. The spatio-temporal attention mechanisms in the ST-GCN stream also provide interpretability by identifying critical joints and temporal phases. However, a critical simulation-reality gap persists. While our model achieves an 89.0% F1-score with full supervision on simulated data, zero-shot generalization to unseen subjects drops to 35.9%. This performance decline is likely due to biases in simulated data, such as `intent-to-fall' cues. For older adults, particularly those with diabetes or frailty, this gap is exacerbated by their unique kinematic profiles. To address this, we propose personalization strategies and advocate for privacy-preserving data pipelines to enable real-world validation. Our findings underscore the urgent need to bridge the gap between simulated and real-world data to develop effective fall prediction systems for vulnerable elderly populations.

TL;DR: Proposes \net{} method for better surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis in sparse-view scenarios using Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment and Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian Splatting methods overfit in sparse-view scenarios due to increased anisotropy in flattened Gaussians, leading to poor surface reconstruction and degraded novel view synthesis.

Method: Introduces Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment to bridge rendering quality and geometry estimation, and Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency using both training and unseen views.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets, demonstrating more accurate surface reconstruction while preserving high-quality novel view rendering.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively mitigates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios and jointly enhances both surface reconstruction and view synthesis performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in optimizing Gaussian Splatting for scene geometry have enabled efficient reconstruction of detailed surfaces from images. However, when input views are sparse, such optimization is prone to overfitting, leading to suboptimal reconstruction quality. Existing approaches address this challenge by employing flattened Gaussian primitives to better fit surface geometry, combined with depth regularization to alleviate geometric ambiguities under limited viewpoints. Nevertheless, the increased anisotropy inherent in flattened Gaussians exacerbates overfitting in sparse-view scenarios, hindering accurate surface fitting and degrading novel view synthesis performance. In this paper, we propose \net{}, a method that reconstructs more accurate and detailed surfaces while preserving high-quality novel view rendering. Our key insight is to introduce Stereo Geometry-Texture Alignment, which bridges rendering quality and geometry estimation, thereby jointly enhancing both surface reconstruction and view synthesis. In addition, we present a Pseudo-Feature Enhanced Geometry Consistency that enforces multi-view geometric consistency by incorporating both training and unseen views, effectively mitigating overfitting caused by sparse supervision. Extensive experiments on the DTU, BlendedMVS, and Mip-NeRF360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: unreliable and costly instance-level labels, and extremely low witness rates, which motivate the development of more efficient pretraining methods.

Method: Proposes SLAM-AGS framework that jointly optimizes weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, using Adaptive Gradient Surgery to handle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse.

Result: On bone-marrow cytology dataset with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with largest gains at low witness rates.

Conclusion: Resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks in computational cytology, especially at low witness rates.

Abstract: Computational cytology faces two major challenges: i) instance-level labels are unreliable and prohibitively costly to obtain, ii) witness rates are extremely low. We propose SLAM-AGS, a Slide-Label-Aware Multitask pretraining framework that jointly optimizes (i) a weakly supervised similarity objective on slide-negative patches and (ii) a self-supervised contrastive objective on slide-positive patches, yielding stronger performance on downstream tasks. To stabilize learning, we apply Adaptive Gradient Surgery to tackle conflicting task gradients and prevent model collapse. We integrate the pretrained encoder into an attention-based Multiple Instance Learning aggregator for bag-level prediction and attention-guided retrieval of the most abnormal instances in a bag. On a publicly available bone-marrow cytology dataset, with simulated witness rates from 10% down to 0.5%, SLAM-AGS improves bag-level F1-Score and Top 400 positive cell retrieval over other pretraining methods, with the largest gains at low witness rates, showing that resolving gradient interference enables stable pretraining and better performance on downstream tasks.

Motivation: Manual airway segmentation from CT scans is impractical, and automated U-Net-based methods often produce disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction.

Method: Three-stage framework: 1) nnU-Net-based network produces initial airway mask, 2) skeleton-based algorithm identifies discontinuities and proposes reconnections, 3) 1D convolutional classifier determines true anatomical branches vs false paths.

Conclusion: RepAir provides robust airway segmentation with improved topological connectivity, making it suitable for quantitative lung analysis in both healthy subjects and patients with severe airway pathology.

Abstract: Accurate airway segmentation from chest computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for quantitative lung analysis, yet manual annotation is impractical and many automated U-Net-based methods yield disconnected components that hinder reliable biomarker extraction. We present RepAir, a three-stage framework for robust 3D airway segmentation that combines an nnU-Net-based network with anatomically informed topology correction. The segmentation network produces an initial airway mask, after which a skeleton-based algorithm identifies potential discontinuities and proposes reconnections. A 1D convolutional classifier then determines which candidate links correspond to true anatomical branches versus false or obstructed paths. We evaluate RepAir on two distinct datasets: ATM'22, comprising annotated CT scans from predominantly healthy subjects and AeroPath, encompassing annotated scans with severe airway pathology. Across both datasets, RepAir outperforms existing 3D U-Net-based approaches such as Bronchinet and NaviAirway on both voxel-level and topological metrics, and produces more complete and anatomically consistent airway trees while maintaining high segmentation accuracy.

Motivation: Traditional retinal vessel segmentation methods focus only on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of Doppler holographic data, which captures blood flow dynamics with high temporal resolution.

Method: Proposed approach incorporates features from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline into standard segmentation architectures (U-Nets), enabling them to exploit temporal dynamics in Doppler holograms.

Result: The method achieves performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models, demonstrating that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock deep learning potential for Doppler holography.

Conclusion: Time-resolved preprocessing enables conventional segmentation models to effectively leverage temporal dynamics in Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics.

Abstract: Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models.

Method: Used 1000 images from IMDB-Clean dataset processed in seven resolutions (7000 total samples). Evaluated with MAE, SD, and MedAE using DeepFace and InsightFace.

Result: Both frameworks perform best at 224x224 pixels (MAE: 10.83 years for DeepFace, 7.46 years for InsightFace). Low and very high resolutions degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster.

Conclusion: Image resolution significantly impacts age estimation accuracy. Optimal resolution is 224x224 pixels. InsightFace outperforms DeepFace in both accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.

*Sriram Srinivasan,Srinivasan Aruchamy,Siva Ram Krisha Vadali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyMAD is a deep neural architecture for detecting and classifying simultaneous seismic activities like human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling using spatio-temporal feature fusion and multi-label classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seismic sensors are effective for border surveillance due to their covert nature, but accurately detecting and distinguishing overlapping activities from complex seismic signals remains challenging, which can lead to misclassification and reduced system reliability.

Method: HyMAD integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet, temporal dependencies modeled by RNNs, self-attention layers for intra-modal representations, and cross-modal fusion for multi-label classification of seismic events.

Result: The method achieves competitive performance on real-world field recordings and demonstrates ability to generalize to complex simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles.

Conclusion: HyMAD offers a modular framework for robust seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications, effectively addressing the challenge of detecting simultaneous activities.

Abstract: Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing between overlapping activities that are happening simultaneously, such as human intrusions, animal movements, and vehicle rumbling, remains a major challenge due to the complex and noisy nature of seismic signals. Correctly identifying simultaneous activities is critical because failing to separate them can lead to misclassification, missed detections, and an incomplete understanding of the situation, thereby reducing the reliability of surveillance systems. To tackle this problem, we propose HyMAD (Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection), a deep neural architecture based on spatio-temporal feature fusion. The framework integrates spectral features extracted with SincNet and temporal dependencies modeled by a recurrent neural network (RNN). In addition, HyMAD employs self-attention layers to strengthen intra-modal representations and a cross-modal fusion module to achieve robust multi-label classification of seismic events. e evaluate our approach on a dataset constructed from real-world field recordings collected in the context of border surveillance and monitoring, demonstrating its ability to generalize to complex, simultaneous activity scenarios involving humans, animals, and vehicles. Our method achieves competitive performance and offers a modular framework for extending seismic-based activity recognition in real-world security applications.

TL;DR: A multimodal framework integrating ECG signals and anatomical priors for improved myocardial scar segmentation in LGE cardiac MRI, using temporal-aware feature fusion to handle non-simultaneous acquisitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LGE cardiac MRI scar segmentation faces challenges due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. ECG signals provide complementary physiological information about conduction abnormalities that can help localize scarred regions, offering potential for more robust segmentation.

Method: Proposed a multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from AHA-17 atlas. Introduced Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism to dynamically weight and fuse features based on acquisition time differences between ECGs and LGE-MRIs.

Result: Achieved substantial improvements over state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463, with high precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043) on clinical dataset.

Conclusion: Integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge enables the model to 'see beyond the image', setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation by leveraging complementary information sources.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to "see beyond the image", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free method for generating ultra-high-resolution videos using pretrained video Diffusion Transformers via inward sliding window attention and cross-attention override strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic time and memory complexity of attention mechanisms in Transformer-based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive.

Method: Uses inward sliding window attention with a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with cross-attention override strategy, plus cross-attention caching for efficiency.

Result: Generates ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency, achieving superior performance on VBench compared to training-based alternatives.

Conclusion: The method successfully enables training-free generation of high-resolution videos while maintaining visual fidelity and global coherence.

Abstract: The quadratic time and memory complexity of the attention mechanism in modern Transformer based video generators makes end-to-end training for ultra high resolution videos prohibitively expensive. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce a training-free approach that leverages video Diffusion Transformers pretrained at their native scale to synthesize higher resolution videos without any additional training or adaptation. At the core of our method lies an inward sliding window attention mechanism, which originates from a key observation: maintaining each query token's training scale receptive field is crucial for preserving visual fidelity and detail. However, naive local window attention, unfortunately, often leads to repetitive content and exhibits a lack of global coherence in the generated results. To overcome this challenge, we devise a dual-path pipeline that backs up window attention with a novel cross-attention override strategy, enabling the semantic content produced by local attention to be guided by another branch with a full receptive field and, therefore, ensuring holistic consistency. Furthermore, to improve efficiency, we incorporate a cross-attention caching strategy for this branch to avoid the frequent computation of full 3D attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method delivers ultra-high-resolution videos with fine-grained visual details and high efficiency in a training-free paradigm. Meanwhile, it achieves superior performance on VBench, even compared to training-based alternatives, with competitive or improved efficiency.

*Xiyuan Wang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a unified single-network architecture that combines encoder, decoder, and diffusion into one end-to-end trainable model, solving latent collapse issues and achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard latent diffusion models use complex three-part architectures (encoder, decoder, diffusion network) that are computationally inefficient, suboptimal, and prevent unification with single-network vision foundation models.

Method: Identifies latent collapse problem in naive joint training, draws analogy between diffusion and self-distillation, and proposes DSD framework with modified training objectives to stabilize latent space for end-to-end single-network training.

Result: Achieves FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 on ImageNet 256×256 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs, without classifier-free-guidance.

Conclusion: DSD enables stable end-to-end training of unified diffusion models, outperforming traditional modular architectures while being more parameter-efficient.

Abstract: Standard Latent Diffusion Models rely on a complex, three-part architecture consisting of a separate encoder, decoder, and diffusion network, which are trained in multiple stages. This modular design is computationally inefficient, leads to suboptimal performance, and prevents the unification of diffusion with the single-network architectures common in vision foundation models. Our goal is to unify these three components into a single, end-to-end trainable network. We first demonstrate that a naive joint training approach fails catastrophically due to ``latent collapse'', where the diffusion training objective interferes with the network's ability to learn a good latent representation. We identify the root causes of this instability by drawing a novel analogy between diffusion and self-distillation based unsupervised learning method. Based on this insight, we propose Diffusion as Self-Distillation (DSD), a new framework with key modifications to the training objective that stabilize the latent space. This approach enables, for the first time, the stable end-to-end training of a single network that simultaneously learns to encode, decode, and perform diffusion. DSD achieves outstanding performance on the ImageNet $256\times 256$ conditional generation task: FID=13.44/6.38/4.25 with only 42M/118M/205M parameters and 50 training epochs on ImageNet, without using classifier-free-guidance.

TL;DR: Zero-shot framework for enhancing synthetic video realism using diffusion models, preserving multi-level structures without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve synthetic video realism while maintaining structural consistency with original content in both spatial and temporal domains.

Method: Uses diffusion video foundational model conditioned on structure-aware information (depth maps, semantic maps, edge maps) extracted from synthetic videos via auxiliary model, without simulator access.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality.

Conclusion: Simple yet general approach that effectively enhances synthetic video realism while preserving original structural and semantic information.

Abstract: We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting insights from 3D urban datasets is challenging due to computational bottlenecks, complex geometry causing occlusion, and inefficient manual viewpoint adjustments for large-scale exploration.

Method: Propose a view-based approach using vector fields to encode views, with neural field-based implicit representation of 3D environments supporting both direct queries (view assessment indices) and inverse queries (finding optimal views while avoiding occlusion).

Result: Validated through quantitative experiments, real-world case studies, and expert feedback; effective for finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses 3D urban data exploration challenges, supporting key urban analysis tasks like visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and visual impact analysis of developments.

Abstract: Despite the growing availability of 3D urban datasets, extracting insights remains challenging due to computational bottlenecks and the complexity of interacting with data. In fact, the intricate geometry of 3D urban environments results in high degrees of occlusion and requires extensive manual viewpoint adjustments that make large-scale exploration inefficient. To address this, we propose a view-based approach for 3D data exploration, where a vector field encodes views from the environment. To support this approach, we introduce a neural field-based method that constructs an efficient implicit representation of 3D environments. This representation enables both faster direct queries, which consist of the computation of view assessment indices, and inverse queries, which help avoid occlusion and facilitate the search for views that match desired data patterns. Our approach supports key urban analysis tasks such as visibility assessments, solar exposure evaluation, and assessing the visual impact of new developments. We validate our method through quantitative experiments, case studies informed by real-world urban challenges, and feedback from domain experts. Results show its effectiveness in finding desirable viewpoints, analyzing building facade visibility, and evaluating views from outdoor spaces.

Motivation: Engagement recognition in videos faces challenges from subjective labels and noise that limit model performance, requiring better methods to handle annotation uncertainty.

Method: Uses VLMs to refine annotations via behavioral cues from questionnaires, splits data into high/low-reliability subsets, and applies curriculum learning with soft label refinement to gradually incorporate ambiguous samples.

Result: Outperforms prior state-of-the-art on engagement benchmarks: EngageNet (3/6 feature settings, max +1.21% improvement), DREAMS (+0.22 F1), and PAFE (+0.06 F1).

Conclusion: Addressing label subjectivity with VLMs and curriculum learning improves engagement recognition, showing classical models can achieve better performance with refined high-reliability data and uncertainty-aware training.

Abstract: Engagement recognition in video datasets, unlike traditional image classification tasks, is particularly challenged by subjective labels and noise limiting model performance. To overcome the challenges of subjective and noisy engagement labels, we propose a framework leveraging Vision Large Language Models (VLMs) to refine annotations and guide the training process. Our framework uses a questionnaire to extract behavioral cues and split data into high- and low-reliability subsets. We also introduce a training strategy combining curriculum learning with soft label refinement, gradually incorporating ambiguous samples while adjusting supervision to reflect uncertainty. We demonstrate that classical computer vision models trained on refined high-reliability subsets and enhanced with our curriculum strategy show improvements, highlighting benefits of addressing label subjectivity with VLMs. This method surpasses prior state of the art across engagement benchmarks such as EngageNet (three of six feature settings, maximum improvement of +1.21%), and DREAMS / PAFE with F1 gains of +0.22 / +0.06.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC tasks are inherently visual but have been primarily approached as language problems. The authors argue for a vision-centric perspective to better leverage the visual nature of these reasoning tasks.

Method: Represent ARC inputs on a 'canvas' as natural images and apply Vision Transformer (ViT) for image-to-image mapping. Train from scratch on ARC data with test-time training for generalization to unseen tasks.

Result: Achieves 60.4% accuracy on ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing from-scratch methods and being competitive with leading LLMs while closing the gap to average human performance.

Conclusion: Vision-centric approaches are effective for abstract reasoning tasks in ARC, demonstrating that standard vision architectures can achieve strong performance when properly adapted to the visual nature of these problems.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a "canvas" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.

*Jeremiah Bohr*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Language models generate verbose code that differs from human style. This study compares instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts for stylistic control during code generation and enhancement, finding combined prompts provide the most stable control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial code implementations while maintaining functional accuracy, and to compare the effectiveness of different prompting mechanisms for stylistic control.

Method: Used a paired two-turn protocol with four prompt conditions (instruction-based, example-based, combined, and control) where models first generated Python solutions, then revised code under general improvement directives (N=160 paired programs).

Result: Combined prompts produced strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects with moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline.

Conclusion: Initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in two-turn workflows.

Abstract: Language models generate functionally correct code that tends toward excessive verbosity, with elaborate documentation and defensive patterns that diverge from human baselines. Two prompting mechanisms have emerged for stylistic control: instruction based prompts that articulate abstract directives, and example based prompts that provide concrete code demonstrations. The core problem is whether stylistic constraints persist when models enhance initial implementations with additional features while maintaining high functional accuracy. Here we show that instruction-based, example-based, and combined prompts produce distinct patterns of initial control and expansion discipline over one enhancement turn. We manipulated system prompts across four conditions in a paired two-turn protocol where models first generated solutions to an intermediate Python task, then revised their code under general improvement directives, holding the user task fixed (N = 160 paired programs). Combined prompts produced the strongest initial compression and greatest expansion discipline. Instructions showed large initial effects and moderate expansion discipline. Examples showed modest initial effects with no expansion discipline. These results show that initial prompt effectiveness and expansion discipline are separate aspects of prompt design, and that combined approaches provide the most stable stylistic control in this two-turn workflow.

*Kallol Mondal,Ankush Kumar*

TL;DR: Proposes S²TDPT, a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for energy-efficient, hardware-friendly computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers are energy-intensive and diverge from brain-like computation. Current spiking attention methods still use non-neuromorphic approaches with von Neumann bottlenecks.

Method: Implements self-attention through STDP, embedding query-key correlations in synaptic weights to enable in-memory computing and avoid von Neumann bottlenecks.

Result: Achieves 94.35% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 78.08% on CIFAR-100 with only 0.49 mJ energy (88.47% reduction vs ANN Transformer). Grad-CAM shows semantically relevant attention.

Conclusion: S²TDPT demonstrates how biologically inspired attention can create energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.

Abstract: Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\% and 78.08\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.

Motivation: To assess the capability of agentic AI scientists in generating and testing scientific hypotheses autonomously, specifically in radiation biology.

Method: Evaluated KOSMOS on three radiation biology problems using simple random-gene null benchmarks and statistical correlation analysis (Spearman rho, empirical p-values, concordance index).

Result: Hypothesis 1 (DDR-p53): weakly negative correlation (rho=-0.40, p=0.76), indistinguishable from random. Hypothesis 2 (OGT/CDO1): OGT weak association (r=0.23, p=0.34), CDO1 strong outlier (r=0.70, p=0.0039). Hypothesis 3 (12-gene signature): concordance index 0.61 (p=0.017) but non-unique effect size.

Conclusion: AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models, as demonstrated by the mixed performance across three hypotheses.

Abstract: Agentic AI "scientists" now use language models to search the literature, run analyses, and generate hypotheses. We evaluate KOSMOS, an autonomous AI scientist, on three problems in radiation biology using simple random-gene null benchmarks. Hypothesis 1: baseline DNA damage response (DDR) capacity across cell lines predicts the p53 transcriptional response after irradiation (GSE30240). Hypothesis 2: baseline expression of OGT and CDO1 predicts the strength of repressed and induced radiation-response modules in breast cancer cells (GSE59732). Hypothesis 3: a 12-gene expression signature predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival after prostate radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy (GSE116918). The DDR-p53 hypothesis was not supported: DDR score and p53 response were weakly negatively correlated (Spearman rho = -0.40, p = 0.76), indistinguishable from random five-gene scores. OGT showed only a weak association (r = 0.23, p = 0.34), whereas CDO1 was a clear outlier (r = 0.70, empirical p = 0.0039). The 12-gene signature achieved a concordance index of 0.61 (p = 0.017) but a non-unique effect size. Overall, KOSMOS produced one well-supported discovery, one plausible but uncertain result, and one false hypothesis, illustrating that AI scientists can generate useful ideas but require rigorous auditing against appropriate null models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an integrated multi-agent system for scientific and engineering workflows that emphasizes transparency, provenance tracking, and adaptability to evolving scientific corpora.

Method: Uses Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow with prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph, hybrid memory (FAISS + SQLite), incremental indexing with file hashing, and configuration-driven project bootstrap.

Result: Successfully applied to multiple research areas at Argonne National Laboratory including waste-to-products research and energy process safety, demonstrating cross-domain applicability.

Conclusion: AISAC provides an effective framework for scientific multi-agent systems with transparency and adaptability, proven through real-world applications across diverse research domains.

Abstract: AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.
  The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher. Each role is defined through custom system prompts that enforce structured JSON outputs. A hybrid memory approach (FAISS + SQLite) enables both semantic retrieval and structured conversation history. An incremental indexing strategy based on file hashing minimizes redundant re-embedding when scientific corpora evolve. A configuration-driven project bootstrap layer allows research teams to customize tools, prompts, and data sources without modifying core code.
  All agent decisions, tool invocations, and retrievals are logged and visualized through a custom Gradio interface, providing step-by-step transparency for each reasoning episode. The authors have applied AISAC to multiple research areas at Argonne, including specialized deployments for waste-to-products research and energy process safety, as well as general-purpose scientific assistance, demonstrating its cross-domain applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial information retrieval from lengthy filings is crucial for operational and analytical decision-making, but extracting task-relevant information efficiently remains challenging.

Method: PRISM integrates three components: refined system prompting for precise instructions, in-context learning with semantically relevant examples, and a lightweight multi-agent system for coordinated scoring behavior.

Result: Achieves NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on restricted validation split, demonstrating feasibility and robustness for production-scale financial retrieval.

Conclusion: PRISM's modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world financial retrieval applications without requiring model training.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.

Result: Extensive experiments on InsightBench show DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels.

Conclusion: DataSage provides an effective solution for automated data insight discovery by addressing key limitations of current LLM-driven agents through its multi-agent framework design.

Abstract: In today's data-driven era, fully automated end-to-end data analytics, particularly insight discovery, is critical for discovering actionable insights that assist organizations in making effective decisions. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KANGURA is a novel 3D machine learning framework that uses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for geometry-aware learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ModelNet40 (92.7% accuracy) and MFC anode structure optimization (97% accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing predictive models struggle to capture complex geometric dependencies needed to optimize Microbial Fuel Cell anode structures, limiting sustainable energy generation capabilities.

Method: Proposes KANGURA framework using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based representation learning for function decomposition, geometry-disentangled representation learning to separate structural variations, and unified attention mechanisms to enhance critical geometric regions.

Result: Outperforms 15+ SOTA models on ModelNet40 (92.7% accuracy) and achieves 97% accuracy on real-world MFC anode structure optimization problem.

Conclusion: KANGURA establishes a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, enabling optimization of complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

Abstract: Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) offer a promising pathway for sustainable energy generation by converting organic matter into electricity through microbial processes. A key factor influencing MFC performance is the anode structure, where design and material properties play a crucial role. Existing predictive models struggle to capture the complex geometric dependencies necessary to optimize these structures. To solve this problem, we propose KANGURA: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-Based Geometry-Aware Learning with Unified Representation Attention. KANGURA introduces a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) machine learning modeling. It formulates prediction as a function decomposition problem, where Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)- based representation learning reconstructs geometric relationships without a conventional multi- layer perceptron (MLP). To refine spatial understanding, geometry-disentangled representation learning separates structural variations into interpretable components, while unified attention mechanisms dynamically enhance critical geometric regions. Experimental results demonstrate that KANGURA outperforms over 15 state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the ModelNet40 benchmark dataset, achieving 92.7% accuracy, and excels in a real-world MFC anode structure problem with 97% accuracy. This establishes KANGURA as a robust framework for 3D geometric modeling, unlocking new possibilities for optimizing complex structures in advanced manufacturing and quality-driven engineering applications.

TL;DR: A scene graph-guided generative AI framework synthesizes photorealistic workplace hazard images from OSHA accident reports, with a novel VQA-based evaluation metric outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training vision models for workplace hazard detection requires realistic images of unsafe conditions, but capturing actual accident scenarios is nearly impossible due to safety and timing constraints.

Method: OSHA accident reports are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, converted into object-level scene graphs that guide a text-to-image diffusion model. A visual question answering (VQA) framework evaluates realism and semantic fidelity.

Result: The proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics across four state-of-the-art generative models, showing higher discriminative sensitivity through entropy-based validation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully generates photorealistic workplace hazard images from textual accident reports, with the VQA-based evaluation providing superior assessment of realism and semantic accuracy compared to existing metrics.

Abstract: Training vision models to detect workplace hazards accurately requires realistic images of unsafe conditions that could lead to accidents. However, acquiring such datasets is difficult because capturing accident-triggering scenarios as they occur is nearly impossible. To overcome this limitation, this study presents a novel scene graph-guided generative AI framework that synthesizes photorealistic images of hazardous scenarios grounded in historical Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) accident reports. OSHA narratives are analyzed using GPT-4o to extract structured hazard reasoning, which is converted into object-level scene graphs capturing spatial and contextual relationships essential for understanding risk. These graphs guide a text-to-image diffusion model to generate compositionally accurate hazard scenes. To evaluate the realism and semantic fidelity of the generated data, a visual question answering (VQA) framework is introduced. Across four state-of-the-art generative models, the proposed VQA Graph Score outperforms CLIP and BLIP metrics based on entropy-based validation, confirming its higher discriminative sensitivity.

### [192] [Rdgai: Classifying transcriptional changes using Large Language Models with a test case from an Arabic Gospel tradition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13801)
*Robert Turnbull*

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: Rdga is a software package that automates classification of textual variants using LLMs, enabling more accurate phylogenetic analysis of textual traditions by accounting for different types of changes rather than treating all variants as equivalent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional phylogenetic methods treat all textual changes as equivalent, ignoring that certain types of variants are more likely to occur. Manual classification of readings is time-consuming and presents a barrier to probabilistic phylogenetic analysis.

Method: Developed Rdga software that uses multi-lingual large language models (LLMs) to automate classification of textual variants. Users manually classify some changes, then the tool uses these annotations to automatically classify remaining reading transitions via LLM prompts.

Result: The tool successfully automates classification of reading transitions, storing results in TEI XML format ready for phylogenetic analysis. Demonstrated application with Arabic Gospel translation data.

Conclusion: Rdga overcomes the barrier of manual classification in textual phylogenetics by leveraging LLMs, enabling more sophisticated probabilistic analysis that accounts for different types of textual changes and their varying likelihoods.

Abstract: Application of phylogenetic methods to textual traditions has traditionally treated all changes as equivalent even though it is widely recognized that certain types of variants were more likely to be introduced than others. While it is possible to give weights to certain changes using a maximum parsimony evaluation criterion, it is difficult to state a priori what these weights should be. Probabilistic methods, such as Bayesian phylogenetics, allow users to create categories of changes, and the transition rates for each category can be estimated as part of the analysis. This classification of types of changes in readings also allows for inspecting the probability of these categories across each branch in the resulting trees. However, classification of readings is time-consuming, as it requires categorizing each reading against every other reading at each variation unit, presenting a significant barrier to entry for this kind of analysis. This paper presents Rdgai, a software package that automates this classification task using multi-lingual large language models (LLMs). The tool allows users to easily manually classify changes in readings and then it uses these annotations in the prompt for an LLM to automatically classify the remaining reading transitions. These classifications are stored in TEI XML and ready for downstream phylogenetic analysis. This paper demonstrates the application with data an Arabic translation of the Gospels.

TL;DR: SciRAG is an open-source framework that improves scientific literature synthesis through adaptive retrieval, citation-aware reasoning, and outline-guided synthesis, outperforming existing methods in factual accuracy and synthesis quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented generation methods for scientific literature often ignore citation graph structure, adapt poorly to complex queries, and produce fragmented, hard-to-verify syntheses.

Method: Three key innovations: (1) adaptive retrieval alternating between sequential and parallel evidence gathering; (2) citation-aware symbolic reasoning using citation graphs to organize and filter documents; (3) outline-guided synthesis that plans, critiques, and refines answers.

Result: Extensive experiments across benchmarks like QASA and ScholarQA show SciRAG outperforms prior systems in factual accuracy and synthesis quality.

Conclusion: SciRAG establishes a new foundation for reliable, large-scale scientific knowledge aggregation.

Abstract: The accelerating growth of scientific publications has intensified the need for scalable, trustworthy systems to synthesize knowledge across diverse literature. While recent retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have improved access to scientific information, they often overlook citation graph structure, adapt poorly to complex queries, and yield fragmented, hard-to-verify syntheses. We introduce SciRAG, an open-source framework for scientific literature exploration that addresses these gaps through three key innovations: (1) adaptive retrieval that flexibly alternates between sequential and parallel evidence gathering; (2) citation-aware symbolic reasoning that leverages citation graphs to organize and filter supporting documents; and (3) outline-guided synthesis that plans, critiques, and refines answers to ensure coherence and transparent attribution. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks such as QASA and ScholarQA demonstrate that SciRAG outperforms prior systems in factual accuracy and synthesis quality, establishing a new foundation for reliable, large-scale scientific knowledge aggregation.

### [194] [GRPO Privacy Is at Risk: A Membership Inference Attack Against Reinforcement Learning With Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14045)
*Yule Liu,Heyi Zhang,Jinyi Zheng,Zhen Sun,Zifan Peng,Tianshuo Cong,Yilong Yang,Xinlei He,Zhuo Ma*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DIBA is the first membership inference attack framework for RLVR-trained LLMs that detects training data exposure through behavioral changes rather than memorization, achieving high attack performance across various settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR training introduces unique privacy risks where membership inference must determine if a prompt (not response) was used during fine-tuning, creating a threat from behavioral changes rather than answer memorization.

Method: DIBA leverages measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (policy drift) to infer membership.

Result: DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines with ~0.8 AUC and order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR, remaining robust across multiple settings and under moderate defenses.

Conclusion: Even without explicit supervision, training data exposure in RLVR can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces, revealing systematic privacy vulnerabilities in this training paradigm.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.
  To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.

*Eric Xue,Ruiyi Zhang,Zijun Zhang,Pengtao Xie*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SteganoBackdoor introduces a stealthy backdoor attack using semantic triggers and steganography, achieving high attack success with low poisoning rates while evading existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current backdoor research focuses on artificial triggers, ignoring the practical threat of semantic triggers tied to real entities. There's a need for attacks that align with realistic threat models.

Method: Uses gradient-guided data optimization to transform semantic triggers into steganographic carriers that embed backdoor payloads while maintaining fluency and hiding trigger resemblance.

Result: Achieves over 99% attack success with order-of-magnitude lower poisoning rates than prior methods, while evading comprehensive data-level defenses.

Conclusion: Reveals a critical blind spot in current defenses, demanding immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.

Abstract: Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.

*Samuel Nathanson,Rebecca Williams,Cynthia Matuszek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Larger language models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones, with harm likelihood increasing with attacker-to-target size ratio, showing size asymmetry impacts adversarial robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how LLM vulnerabilities scale in multi-agent adversarial settings and whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller aligned models despite safety safeguards.

Method: Simulated over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across LLM families (0.6B-120B parameters) using JailbreakBench tasks, measuring harm and refusal scores evaluated by three independent LLM judges.

Result: Strong correlation between mean harm and logarithm of attacker-to-target size ratio (r=0.51), higher variance in attacker behavior than target susceptibility, and strong negative correlation between attacker refusal and harm (rho=-0.93).

Conclusion: Size asymmetry significantly influences adversarial robustness, with larger models more effective at jailbreaking smaller ones, motivating further investigation into inter-model alignment and safety scaling patterns.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly operate in multi-agent and safety-critical settings, raising open questions about how their vulnerabilities scale when models interact adversarially. This study examines whether larger models can systematically jailbreak smaller ones - eliciting harmful or restricted behavior despite alignment safeguards. Using standardized adversarial tasks from JailbreakBench, we simulate over 6,000 multi-turn attacker-target exchanges across major LLM families and scales (0.6B-120B parameters), measuring both harm score and refusal behavior as indicators of adversarial potency and alignment integrity. Each interaction is evaluated through aggregated harm and refusal scores assigned by three independent LLM judges, providing a consistent, model-based measure of adversarial outcomes. Aggregating results across prompts, we find a strong and statistically significant correlation between mean harm and the logarithm of the attacker-to-target size ratio (Pearson r = 0.51, p < 0.001; Spearman rho = 0.52, p < 0.001), indicating that relative model size correlates with the likelihood and severity of harmful completions. Mean harm score variance is higher across attackers (0.18) than across targets (0.10), suggesting that attacker-side behavioral diversity contributes more to adversarial outcomes than target susceptibility. Attacker refusal frequency is strongly and negatively correlated with harm (rho = -0.93, p < 0.001), showing that attacker-side alignment mitigates harmful responses. These findings reveal that size asymmetry influences robustness and provide exploratory evidence for adversarial scaling patterns, motivating more controlled investigations into inter-model alignment and safety.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoETTA is a novel TTA framework using Mixture-of-Experts to handle mixed distribution shifts by enabling diverse gradient directions through structurally decoupled experts, outperforming existing methods on new realistic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployments face mixed distribution shifts with conflicting domain factors, but current TTA methods use unified adaptation paths that fail to account for varying optimal gradient directions across domains. Existing benchmarks also lack realistic heterogeneous shifts.

Method: Proposes MoETTA framework integrating Mixture-of-Experts architecture with structurally decoupled experts for flexible parameter updates. Introduces two new benchmarks (potpourri and potpourri+) covering natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions plus source-domain samples.

Result: Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shift settings show MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing state-of-the-art performance by modeling multiple adaptation directions through expert-level diversity.

Conclusion: MoETTA effectively addresses heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts through flexible, disentangled parameter updates via expert diversity, demonstrating superior performance on realistic deployment scenarios compared to unified adaptation approaches.

Abstract: Test-Time adaptation (TTA) has proven effective in mitigating performance drops under single-domain distribution shifts by updating model parameters during inference. However, real-world deployments often involve mixed distribution shifts, where test samples are affected by diverse and potentially conflicting domain factors, posing significant challenges even for SOTA TTA methods. A key limitation in existing approaches is their reliance on a unified adaptation path, which fails to account for the fact that optimal gradient directions can vary significantly across different domains. Moreover, current benchmarks focus only on synthetic or homogeneous shifts, failing to capture the complexity of real-world heterogeneous mixed distribution shifts. To address this, we propose MoETTA, a novel entropy-based TTA framework that integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Rather than enforcing a single parameter update rule for all test samples, MoETTA introduces a set of structurally decoupled experts, enabling adaptation along diverse gradient directions. This design allows the model to better accommodate heterogeneous shifts through flexible and disentangled parameter updates. To simulate realistic deployment conditions, we introduce two new benchmarks: potpourri and potpourri+. While classical settings focus solely on synthetic corruptions, potpourri encompasses a broader range of domain shifts--including natural, artistic, and adversarial distortions--capturing more realistic deployment challenges. Additionally, potpourri+ further includes source-domain samples to evaluate robustness against catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments across three mixed distribution shifts settings show that MoETTA consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing SOTA performance and highlighting the benefit of modeling multiple adaptation directions via expert-level diversity.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper explores SSL transferability, proposes TC² method to address task conflicts, and improves representation transferability through meta-learning inspired approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand SSL representation transferability and develop effective methods to model it, addressing limitations caused by task conflicts.

Method: Proposes Task Conflict Calibration (TC²) method using batch splitting, factor extraction network, weight extraction network with reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity constraints, integrated via two-stage bi-level optimization.

Result: Experimental results show consistent improvement in SSL model transferability across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: TC² method effectively addresses task conflicts and enhances SSL representation transferability through explicit modeling and calibration.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the transferability of SSL by addressing two central questions: (i) what is the representation transferability of SSL, and (ii) how can we effectively model this transferability? Transferability is defined as the ability of a representation learned from one task to support the objective of another.
  Inspired by the meta-learning paradigm, we construct multiple SSL tasks within each training batch to support explicitly modeling transferability. Based on empirical evidence and causal analysis, we find that although introducing task-level information improves transferability, it is still hindered by task conflict. To address this issue, we propose a Task Conflict Calibration (TC$^2$) method to alleviate the impact of task conflict. Specifically, it first splits batches to create multiple SSL tasks, infusing task-level information. Next, it uses a factor extraction network to produce causal generative factors for all tasks and a weight extraction network to assign dedicated weights to each sample, employing data reconstruction, orthogonality, and sparsity to ensure effectiveness. Finally, TC$^2$ calibrates sample representations during SSL training and integrates into the pipeline via a two-stage bi-level optimization framework to boost the transferability of learned representations. Experimental results on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our method consistently improves the transferability of SSL models.

*Saleh Momeni,Changnan Xiao,Bing Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AnaCP enables incremental feature adaptation in class-incremental learning without gradient-based training, achieving joint training accuracy while avoiding catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CIL methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and while pre-trained models help, they still can't adapt features incrementally, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Analytic Contrastive Projection (AnaCP) preserves analytic classifier efficiency while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training.

Result: AnaCP outperforms existing baselines and achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is considered the upper bound for CIL.

Conclusion: AnaCP successfully addresses the feature adaptation limitation in CIL while maintaining efficiency and avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of class-incremental learning (CIL), a core setting within continual learning where a model learns a sequence of tasks, each containing a distinct set of classes. Traditional CIL methods, which do not leverage pre-trained models (PTMs), suffer from catastrophic forgetting (CF) due to the need to incrementally learn both feature representations and the classifier. The integration of PTMs into CIL has recently led to efficient approaches that treat the PTM as a fixed feature extractor combined with analytic classifiers, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, they still face a major limitation: the inability to continually adapt feature representations to best suit the CIL tasks, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose AnaCP (Analytic Contrastive Projection), a novel method that preserves the efficiency of analytic classifiers while enabling incremental feature adaptation without gradient-based training, thereby eliminating the CF caused by gradient updates. Our experiments show that AnaCP not only outperforms existing baselines but also achieves the accuracy level of joint training, which is regarded as the upper bound of CIL.

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates how to create imperceptible adversarial perturbations that not only cause misclassification but also spoof certified robustness guarantees, allowing attackers to generate deceptive large robustness certificates for incorrect classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks and understand the limits of robustness guarantee provisions, particularly whether small perturbations can both misclassify inputs and manipulate certification processes.

Method: The authors explore region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations that spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates, with extensive evaluations on ImageNet.

Result: The method effectively bypasses state-of-the-art certified defenses like Densepure, demonstrating the vulnerability of current certification frameworks to certificate spoofing attacks.

Conclusion: This work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods and highlights critical vulnerabilities in current certified defense approaches.

Abstract: Certified defenses promise provable robustness guarantees. We study the malicious exploitation of probabilistic certification frameworks to better understand the limits of guarantee provisions. Now, the objective is to not only mislead a classifier, but also manipulate the certification process to generate a robustness guarantee for an adversarial input certificate spoofing. A recent study in ICLR demonstrated that crafting large perturbations can shift inputs far into regions capable of generating a certificate for an incorrect class. Our study investigates if perturbations needed to cause a misclassification and yet coax a certified model into issuing a deceptive, large robustness radius for a target class can still be made small and imperceptible. We explore the idea of region-focused adversarial examples to craft imperceptible perturbations, spoof certificates and achieve certification radii larger than the source class ghost certificates. Extensive evaluations with the ImageNet demonstrate the ability to effectively bypass state-of-the-art certified defenses such as Densepure. Our work underscores the need to better understand the limits of robustness certification methods.

Abstract: Household tidying is an important application area, yet current benchmarks neither model user preferences nor support mobility, and they generalize poorly, making it hard to comprehensively assess integrated language-to-action capabilities. To address this, we propose RoboTidy, a unified benchmark for language-guided household tidying that supports Vision-Language-Action (VLA) and Vision-Language-Navigation (VLN) training and evaluation. RoboTidy provides 500 photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) household scenes (covering 500 objects and containers) with collisions, formulates tidying as an "Action (Object, Container)" list, and supplies 6.4k high-quality manipulation demonstration trajectories and 1.5k naviagtion trajectories to support both few-shot and large-scale training. We also deploy RoboTidy in the real world for object tidying, establishing an end-to-end benchmark for household tidying. RoboTidy offers a scalable platform and bridges a key gap in embodied AI by enabling holistic and realistic evaluation of language-guided robots.

*Xiuxiu Qi,Yu Yang,Jiannong Cao,Luyao Bai,Chongshan Fan,Chengtai Cao,Hongpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CCoL is a novel behavioral cloning framework that addresses compounding errors through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs, achieving semantic-physical alignment and smooth action execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge in behavioral cloning. Existing approaches suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution.

Method: CCoL generates robust action trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs. It anchors language semantics to visuomotor representations using bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation.

Result: CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot confirm generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

Conclusion: CCoL successfully overcomes semantic-physical misalignment and ensures temporally consistent execution with fine-grained semantic grounding, demonstrating superior performance in both simulation and real-world robotic tasks.

Abstract: Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.

*Cutter Beck,Evan Smith,Khagendra Katuwal,Rudra Kafle,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: astro-ph.IM

TL;DR: Developed CHASM-SWPC dataset and CHASM annotation tool for coronal hole detection, achieving improved neural network performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for high-quality datasets and tools to train automated coronal hole detection models, as coronal holes are important for space weather prediction.

Method: Created semi-automated pipeline to digitize hand-drawn SWPC maps, developed CHASM annotation tool, and trained CHRONNOS neural networks on the resulting dataset.

Result: Generated CHASM-SWPC dataset with 1,111 coronal hole masks. Trained models achieved accuracy of 0.9805, TSS of 0.6807, and IoU of 0.5668, outperforming original CHRONNOS model.

Conclusion: The CHASM-SWPC dataset and annotation tool provide valuable resources for coronal hole detection research, enabling improved automated detection performance.

Abstract: Coronal holes (CHs) are low-activity, low-density solar coronal regions with open magnetic field lines (Cranmer 2009). In the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrum, CHs appear as dark patches. Using daily hand-drawn maps from the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC), we developed a semi-automated pipeline to digitize the SWPC maps into binary segmentation masks. The resulting masks constitute the CHASM-SWPC dataset, a high-quality dataset to train and test automated CH detection models, which is released with this paper. We developed CHASM (Coronal Hole Annotation using Semi-automatic Methods), a software tool for semi-automatic annotation that enables users to rapidly and accurately annotate SWPC maps. The CHASM tool enabled us to annotate 1,111 CH masks, comprising the CHASM-SWPC-1111 dataset. We then trained multiple CHRONNOS (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data) architecture (Jarolim et al. 2021) neural networks using the CHASM-SWPC dataset and compared their performance. Training the CHRONNOS neural network on these data achieved an accuracy of 0.9805, a True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.6807, and an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.5668, which is higher than the original pretrained CHRONNOS model Jarolim et al. (2021) achieved an accuracy of 0.9708, a TSS of 0.6749, and an IoU of 0.4805, when evaluated on the CHASM-SWPC-1111 test set.

TL;DR: LLMs can effectively summarize legal events from videos and draft legal letters, with 71.7% of summaries rated as high or medium quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Laypeople struggle to articulate legally relevant facts for legal documents, and current AI approaches require users to describe events in text, which remains challenging.

Method: Used LLMs to summarize and draft legal letters based on 120 YouTube videos showing legal issues across various domains.

Result: 71.7% of the generated summaries were rated as high or medium quality, demonstrating promising capability.

Conclusion: This approach shows potential for applications in access to justice by helping bridge the gap between laypeople and legal document preparation.

Abstract: Understanding the legally relevant factual basis of an event and conveying it through text is a key skill of legal professionals. This skill is important for preparing forms (e.g., insurance claims) or other legal documents (e.g., court claims), but often presents a challenge for laypeople. Current AI approaches aim to bridge this gap, but mostly rely on the user to articulate what has happened in text, which may be challenging for many. Here, we investigate the capability of large language models (LLMs) to understand and summarize events occurring in videos. We ask an LLM to summarize and draft legal letters, based on 120 YouTube videos showing legal issues in various domains. Overall, 71.7\% of the summaries were rated as of high or medium quality, which is a promising result, opening the door to a number of applications in e.g. access to justice.

### [206] [MindCross: Fast New Subject Adaptation with Limited Data for Cross-subject Video Reconstruction from Brain Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14196)
*Xuan-Hao Liu,Yan-Kai Liu,Tianyi Zhou,Bao-Liang Lu,Wei-Long Zheng*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: MindCross is a cross-subject brain decoding framework that uses specific and shared encoders to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, enabling fast adaptation to new subjects with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing subject-dependent brain decoding methods require large amounts of brain data per subject, which is expensive to collect. Cross-subject methods often neglect subject-specific information and need slow fine-tuning for adaptation.

Method: Proposes MindCross with N specific encoders and one shared encoder to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information respectively, plus a Top-K collaboration module to leverage knowledge from previous subjects' encoders.

Result: Extensive experiments on fMRI/EEG-to-video benchmarks show MindCross achieves effective cross-subject decoding and fast new subject adaptation using only one model.

Conclusion: MindCross provides an efficient solution for cross-subject brain decoding that enables rapid adaptation to new subjects while maintaining both subject-invariant and subject-specific information processing.

Abstract: Reconstructing video from brain signals is an important brain decoding task. Existing brain decoding frameworks are primarily built on a subject-dependent paradigm, which requires large amounts of brain data for each subject. However, the expensive cost of collecting brain-video data causes severe data scarcity. Although some cross-subject methods being introduced, they often overfocus with subject-invariant information while neglecting subject-specific information, resulting in slow fine-tune-based adaptation strategy. To achieve fast and data-efficient new subject adaptation, we propose MindCross, a novel cross-subject framework. MindCross's N specific encoders and one shared encoder are designed to extract subject-specific and subject-invariant information, respectively. Additionally, a Top-K collaboration module is adopted to enhance new subject decoding with the knowledge learned from previous subjects' encoders. Extensive experiments on fMRI/EEG-to-video benchmarks demonstrate MindCross's efficacy and efficiency of cross-subject decoding and new subject adaptation using only one model.

*Rongsheng Qian,Chi Xu,Xiaoqiang Ma,Hao Fang,Yili Jin,William I. Atlas,Jiangchuan Liu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SCOPE is a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction for real-time imaging sonar, achieving 40% improvement in SSIM and 80% bandwidth reduction without requiring clean-noise pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time imaging sonar faces two major challenges: limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames, constraining broader underwater monitoring applications.

Method: SCOPE combines Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC) for frequency-encoded latent representations with Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS) that decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics. Uses hedging training strategy with low-pass proxy pairs for frequency-aware learning.

Result: Achieves SSIM of 0.77 (40% improvement over baselines) at bitrates ≤0.0118 bpp, reduces uplink bandwidth by >80%, improves downstream detection, runs in real-time with 3.1ms encoding on embedded GPU. Successfully deployed for months in Pacific Northwest rivers for salmon enumeration.

Conclusion: Learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions, demonstrating effective joint compression and artifact correction without synthetic assumptions.

Abstract: Real-time imaging sonar has become an important tool for underwater monitoring in environments where optical sensing is unreliable. Its broader use is constrained by two coupled challenges: highly limited uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) that affect up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

*Changsheng Fang,Yongtong Liu,Bahareh Morovati,Shuo Han,Li Zhou,Hengyong Yu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: PoCGM adapts PFGM++ for sparse-view CT reconstruction by incorporating conditional inputs, achieving superior artifact suppression and detail preservation compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing CT projection views lowers radiation exposure but causes severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details, limiting clinical applications.

Method: Reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework that incorporates sparse-view data as guidance during training and sampling, modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations.

Result: Outperforms baselines with improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.

Conclusion: PoCGM effectively addresses sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges by adapting unconditional generative models to conditional medical imaging tasks, demonstrating clinical viability.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), reducing the number of projection views is an effective strategy to lower radiation exposure and/or improve temporal resolution. However, this often results in severe aliasing artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images, posing significant challenges for clinical applications. Inspired by the success of the Poisson Flow Generative Model (PFGM++) in natural image generation, we propose a PoCGM (Poisson-Conditioned Generative Model) to address the challenges of sparse-view CT reconstruction. Since PFGM++ was originally designed for unconditional generation, it lacks direct applicability to medical imaging tasks that require integrating conditional inputs. To overcome this limitation, the PoCGM reformulates PFGM++ into a conditional generative framework by incorporating sparse-view data as guidance during both training and sampling phases. By modeling the posterior distribution of full-view reconstructions conditioned on sparse observations, PoCGM effectively suppresses artifacts while preserving fine structural details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PoCGM outperforms the baselines, achieving improved artifact suppression, enhanced detail preservation, and reliable performance in dose-sensitive and time-critical imaging scenarios.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ELiC is a real-time LiDAR geometry compression framework that improves efficiency through cross-bit-depth feature propagation, Bag-of-Encoders selection, and Morton-order-preserving hierarchy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior hierarchical LiDAR compression methods treat each depth independently and re-estimate local context from coordinates at every level, limiting compression efficiency.

Method: Combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation (reusing features from denser lower depths), Bag-of-Encoders selection (choosing optimal coding network per depth), and Morton-order-preserving hierarchy (maintaining global Z-order across depth transitions).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed components improve both entropy modeling and computation efficiency for LiDAR geometry compression.

Abstract: Hierarchical LiDAR geometry compression encodes voxel occupancies from low to high bit-depths, yet prior methods treat each depth independently and re-estimate local context from coordinates at every level, limiting compression efficiency. We present ELiC, a real-time framework that combines cross-bit-depth feature propagation, a Bag-of-Encoders (BoE) selection scheme, and a Morton-order-preserving hierarchy. Cross-bit-depth propagation reuses features extracted at denser, lower depths to support prediction at sparser, higher depths. BoE selects, per depth, the most suitable coding network from a small pool, adapting capacity to observed occupancy statistics without training a separate model for each level. The Morton hierarchy maintains global Z-order across depth transitions, eliminating per-level sorting and reducing latency. Together these components improve entropy modeling and computation efficiency, yielding state-of-the-art compression at real-time throughput on Ford and SemanticKITTI. Code and models will be released upon publication.

### [210] [IMSE: Efficient U-Net-based Speech Enhancement using Inception Depthwise Convolution and Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14515)
*Xinxin Tang,Bin Qin,Yufang Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: IMSE is an ultra-lightweight speech enhancement network that reduces parameters by 16.8% while maintaining competitive performance by replacing complex modules with efficient alternatives: Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention and Inception Depthwise Convolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lightweight speech enhancement methods like MUSE still suffer from efficiency bottlenecks despite having only 0.51M parameters. The MET module uses complex compensation mechanisms and deformable embedding introduces computational overhead, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Two core innovations: 1) Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA) replaces MET module, preserving query vector norms to address amplitude-ignoring problem without auxiliary compensation. 2) Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv) replaces DE module, using parallel branches (square, horizontal, vertical strips) to capture spectrogram features with minimal parameters.

Result: IMSE reduces parameters by 16.8% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive PESQ score of 3.373 on VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, comparable to state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The study sets a new benchmark for balancing model size and speech quality in ultra-lightweight speech enhancement, demonstrating that systematic optimization can achieve significant parameter reduction without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a significant challenge for speech enhancement (SE) tasks on resource-constrained devices. Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex "approximate-compensate" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the "amplitude-ignoring" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy. Extensive experiments on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset demonstrate that, compared to the MUSE baseline, IMSE significantly reduces the parameter count by 16.8\% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PESQ metric (3.373). This study sets a new benchmark for the trade-off between model size and speech quality in ultra-lightweight speech enhancement.
