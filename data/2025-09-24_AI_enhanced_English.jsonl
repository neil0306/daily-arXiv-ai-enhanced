Unlike prior\nmethods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study\nintroduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt\nscheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling\nstrategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different\ntasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across\ntasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating\nmechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between\nprompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible\nsharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective\ncenters on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning\nstrategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference\nand negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of\nsensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact\nof prompt temperature parameters and task number variation.

Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods\nrely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not\nalways readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have\nshown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the\napplications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with\nthe environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that\naims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an\nexplicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for\nmulti-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with\na 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this\napproach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated\nby video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D\nscenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our\nframework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input\nvideo. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "A self-distillation framework that distills 3D knowledge from video diffusion models into 3D Gaussian Splatting representation for generating virtual environments without requiring multi-view training data.", "motivation": "Current 3D reconstruction methods need real-world multi-view data, which is often unavailable.
