### [1] [Enriching Historical Records: An OCR and AI-Driven Approach for Database Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23710)
*Zahra Abedi,Richard M. K. van Dijk,Gijs Wijnholds,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed an automated pipeline combining OCR, LLM-based interpretation, and database linking to digitize historical professor records from Leiden University books, achieving high accuracy in data extraction and linkage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an automated system for digitizing and harmonizing historical biographic data from typewritten documents with existing high-quality database records, addressing challenges in digital humanities like layout variability and terminology differences.

Method: Used OCR techniques for text extraction, generative AI with decoding constraints for structured data interpretation, and database linkage methods to connect extracted data with existing records.

Result: OCR achieved 1.08% CER and 5.06% WER; JSON extraction accuracy was 63% from OCR text and 65% from annotated OCR; record linkage achieved 94% accuracy with annotated JSON and 81% with OCR-derived JSON.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully automates historical document digitization, demonstrates generative AI's ability to correct OCR errors, and provides a valuable tool for digital humanities research with high linkage accuracy.

Abstract: This research digitizes and analyzes the Leidse hoogleraren en lectoren 1575-1815 books written between 1983 and 1985, which contain biographic data about professors and curators of Leiden University. It addresses the central question: how can we design an automated pipeline that integrates OCR, LLM-based interpretation, and database linking to harmonize data from historical document images with existing high-quality database records? We applied OCR techniques, generative AI decoding constraints that structure data extraction, and database linkage methods to process typewritten historical records into a digital format. OCR achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.08 percent and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.06 percent, while JSON extraction from OCR text achieved an average accuracy of 63 percent and, based on annotated OCR, 65 percent. This indicates that generative AI somewhat corrects low OCR performance. Our record linkage algorithm linked annotated JSON files with 94% accuracy and OCR-derived JSON files with 81%. This study contributes to digital humanities research by offering an automated pipeline for interpreting digitized historical documents, addressing challenges like layout variability and terminology differences, and exploring the applicability and strength of an advanced generative AI model.

### [2] [CAT: A Metric-Driven Framework for Analyzing the Consistency-Accuracy Relation of LLMs under Controlled Input Variations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23711)
*Paulo Cavalin,Cassia Sanctos,Marcelo Grave,Claudio Pinhanez,Yago Primerano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAT framework evaluates LLMs on both accuracy and response consistency using CAR curves and CORE index, showing their interplay beyond independent metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation focuses mainly on accuracy/benchmark scores, with consistency emerging as important for real-world deployment. The authors argue that while both dimensions should be evaluated independently, their interdependence needs consideration for more nuanced LLM assessment.

Method: Introduces CAT framework with Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR) curves that visualize how accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, using Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA) metric. Also proposes Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE) index that combines area and shape of CAR curve to quantify accuracy-consistency trade-off.

Result: Demonstrated framework across diverse generalist and domain-specific LLMs on multiple-choice benchmarks. Showed how CAT can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

Conclusion: CAT provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the interplay between accuracy and consistency in LLMs, offering both visualization (CAR curves) and quantification (CORE index) of this relationship for more nuanced model assessment.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{CAT}, a framework designed to evaluate and visualize the \emph{interplay} of \emph{accuracy} and \emph{response consistency} of Large Language Models (LLMs) under controllable input variations, using multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks as a case study. Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \textsc{CAT} are the \emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

### [3] [STED and Consistency Scoring: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Structured Output Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23712)
*Guanghui Wang,Jinze Yu,Xing Zhang,Dayuan Jiang,Yin Song,Tomal Deb,Xuefeng Liu,Peiyang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating and improving consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs using STED metric and consistency scoring, with benchmarking showing Claude-3.7-Sonnet as most consistent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for structured data generation, but output consistency is critical for production applications. Current evaluation methods lack proper balance between semantic flexibility and structural strictness.

Method: Combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance) - a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness for JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations.

Result: STED achieves superior performance (0.86-0.90 similarity for semantic equivalents, 0.0 for structural breaks) vs existing metrics. Claude-3.7-Sonnet shows exceptional consistency, while other models degrade at higher temperatures.

Conclusion: The framework enables practical applications for model selection, prompt refinement, and diagnostic analysis, providing theoretical foundations and tools for reliable structured output generation in LLM-based production systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for structured data generation, yet output consistency remains critical for production applications. We introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs. Our approach combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance), a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness when comparing JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations to quantify reliability. Through systematic experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled schema, expression, and semantic variations, we demonstrate STED achieves superior performance ($0.86-0.90$ similarity for semantic equivalents, $0.0$ for structural breaks) compared to existing metrics including TED, BERTScore, and DeepDiff. Applying our framework to benchmark six LLMs reveals significant variations: Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional consistency, maintaining near-perfect structural reliability even at high temperatures ($T=0.9$), while models like Claude-3-Haiku and Nova-Pro exhibit substantial degradation requiring careful tuning. Our framework enables practical applications including targeted model selection for structured tasks, iterative prompt refinement for reproducible results, and diagnostic analysis to identify inconsistency root causes. This work provides theoretical foundations and practical tools for ensuring reliable structured output generation in LLM-based production systems.

### [4] [PyBangla at BLP-2025 Task 2: Enhancing Bangla-to-Python Code Generation with Iterative Self-Correction and Multilingual Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23713)
*Jahidul Islam,Md Ataullha,Saiful Azad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BanglaCodeAct is an agent-based framework using multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction to generate Python code from Bangla instructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Bangla NL2Code tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, this capability hasn't extended to low-resource languages like Bangla. There's a need for effective Bangla-to-Python code generation without requiring task-specific fine-tuning.

Method: BanglaCodeAct uses an agent-based framework with multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. It employs open-source multilingual LLMs within a Thought-Code-Observation loop for dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions.

Result: Qwen3-8B with BanglaCodeAct achieved best performance: 94.0% pass@1 accuracy on development set and 71.6% on blind test set of mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code, establishing a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages, providing a framework that doesn't require task-specific fine-tuning while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages. Experimental scripts are publicly available at github.com/jahidulzaid/PyBanglaCodeActAgent.

### [5] [PharmaShip: An Entity-Centric, Reading-Order-Supervised Benchmark for Chinese Pharmaceutical Shipping Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23714)
*Tingwei Xie,Tianyi Zhou,Yonghong Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PharmaShip is a Chinese pharmaceutical shipping document dataset with noisy OCR and diverse templates for testing text-layout models on SER, RE, and ROP tasks, showing that combining pixel and geometry features with reading-order regularization works best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a real-world benchmark for testing pre-trained text-layout models under challenging conditions (noisy OCR, heterogeneous templates) in the safety-critical pharmaceutical domain, where document understanding is crucial.

Method: Created PharmaShip dataset with scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents covering three tasks: sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP). Benchmarked five representative baselines (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their RORE-enhanced variants) with standardized preprocessing, splits, and optimization.

Result: Pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases but neither alone is sufficient. Reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and RE and yields the most robust configuration. Longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at word level but challenging at segment level due to boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings.

Conclusion: PharmaShip establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in pharmaceuticals and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling.

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

### [6] [Noise-Driven Persona Formation in Reflexive Neural Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23716)
*Toshiyuki Shigemura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LN-RP, a framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in LLMs through stochastic noise injection, revealing stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures and phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and long-range linguistic coherence in large language models through controlled noise injection and persona emergence analysis.

Method: The Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP) injects stochastic noise seeds into initial generation states and analyzes linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles to observe nonlinear transitions and persona emergence.

Result: Reveals three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, demonstrates external noise can induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics, and shows consistent persona retention with significant differences across modes (p < 0.01).

Conclusion: LN-RP provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and long-range linguistic coherence in LLMs through noise-driven persona emergence analysis.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

### [7] [HarmTransform: Transforming Explicit Harmful Queries into Stealthy via Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23717)
*Shenzhe Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HarmTransform is a multi-agent debate framework that systematically transforms harmful queries into stealthier forms to improve LLM safety alignment by generating better training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety mechanisms focus on overtly dangerous content but fail to detect covert harmful queries where users disguise malicious intent through benign-sounding rephrasing, creating a gap in safety training data.

Method: HarmTransform uses a multi-agent debate framework where multiple agents iteratively critique and refine harmful queries to transform them into stealthier forms while preserving the underlying harmful intent.

Result: Experiments show HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations, though debate can be a double-edged sword - improving stealth while potentially introducing topic shifts and unnecessary complexity.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate shows promise for generating comprehensive safety training data but has limitations, highlighting the need for balanced approaches to improve LLM safety against covert threats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

### [8] [Emergent World Beliefs: Exploring Transformers in Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23722)
*Adam Kamel,Tanish Rastogi,Michael Ma,Kailash Ranganathan,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs pretrained on poker hand history data learn to represent both deterministic game structure and stochastic features, developing internal models of partially observable environments without explicit instruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can develop emergent world models in domains of incomplete information (POMDPs), extending prior work on perfect information games to partially observable environments like poker.

Method: Pretrained a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probed its internal activations using primarily nonlinear probes to analyze learned representations.

Result: The model learned both deterministic structure (hand ranks) and stochastic features (equity) without explicit instruction. These representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states.

Conclusion: LLMs can learn their own representation of stochastic environments in partially observable domains, suggesting they develop internal models of POMDPs like Texas Hold'em Poker.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

### [9] [When in Doubt, Deliberate: Confidence-Based Routing to Expert Debate for Sexism Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23732)
*Anwar Alajmi,Gabriele Pergola*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Two-stage framework combining targeted training procedures with reasoning-based inference to detect subtle, context-dependent sexist content online, achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detection methods fail to identify subtle, context-dependent sexist content due to overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions that create mixed signals, label scarcity, class imbalance, and conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Training with class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to handle label imbalance and noisy supervision; (2) Inference with dynamic routing that classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a Collaborative Expert Judgment module that prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks: +2.72% improvement in F1 on EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and gains of +4.48% and +1.30% on EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the combined challenges of underrepresentation, noise, and conceptual ambiguity in sexist content detection through unified training and reasoning-based inference, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

### [10] [Break Out the Silverware -- Semantic Understanding of Stored Household Items](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23739)
*Michaela Levi-Richter,Reuth Mirsky,Oren Glickman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating service robots' ability to predict where household items are stored out of sight, with a hybrid vision-language model (NOAM) that approaches human-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domestic service robots lack commonsense reasoning to locate everyday items stored out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets, despite advances in vision and manipulation.

Method: Introduces the Stored Household Item Challenge benchmark with two datasets: 100 real-world item-image pairs and 6,500 development pairs. Proposes NOAM, a hybrid pipeline that converts visual input to natural language descriptions, then uses LLMs (like GPT-4) to infer hidden storage locations.

Result: NOAM significantly outperforms baselines (random selection, vision-language pipelines, multimodal models) and approaches human-level prediction accuracy for locating stored items.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables comparative evaluation of robotic cognitive capabilities, and NOAM demonstrates that combining structured scene understanding with LLM inference enables emergent commonsense reasoning for domestic service robots.

Abstract: ``Bring me a plate.'' For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.
  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.
  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.
  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance. NOAM significantly improves prediction accuracy and approaches human-level results, highlighting best practices for deploying cognitively capable agents in domestic environments.

### [11] [Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding Toward Improved LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23765)
*Tiancheng Su,Meicong Zhang,Guoxiu He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASD improves speculative decoding by adding entropy-based penalty to reject uncertain draft tokens, enabling performance that can surpass the target LLM while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard speculative decoding is limited by excessive alignment between draft and target models, constraining performance to that of the target LLM. The authors aim to overcome this limitation and potentially surpass the target model's performance.

Method: EASD extends standard speculative decoding with a dynamic entropy-based penalty. It uses sampling distribution entropy to quantify uncertainty, rejecting tokens when both models show high entropy with substantial overlap in top-N predictions, then having the target LLM re-sample.

Result: Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. Efficiency is proven comparable to standard SD.

Conclusion: EASD is a training-free enhancement that enables speculative decoding to potentially exceed target LLM performance while maintaining efficiency, addressing a key limitation of standard SD approaches.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MiMo-Audio scales audio pretraining to 100M+ hours, achieving emergent few-shot learning and SOTA performance on diverse audio tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current audio models require task-specific fine-tuning, unlike humans who generalize from few examples. Inspired by GPT-3's scaling success in text, the authors apply this paradigm to audio to achieve similar generalization capabilities.

Method: Scale next-token prediction pretraining to over 100 million hours of audio data (MiMo-Audio-7B-Base), then apply instruction-tuning with thinking mechanisms for both understanding and generation tasks.

Result: Achieves SOTA among open-source models on speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks. Demonstrates emergent few-shot learning, generalization to unseen tasks (voice conversion, style transfer), and powerful speech continuation capabilities. Instruction-tuned version approaches or surpasses closed-source models on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Scaling audio pretraining enables emergent few-shot learning and strong generalization, similar to text models. MiMo-Audio demonstrates the viability of this paradigm for diverse audio tasks including understanding, generation, and dialogue.

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

### [13] [StressRoBERTa: Cross-Condition Transfer Learning from Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD to Stress Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23813)
*Amal Alqahtani,Efsun Kayi,Mona Diab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StressRoBERTa uses cross-condition transfer learning from related mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, PTSD) to improve chronic stress detection in tweets, achieving 82% F1-score and outperforming previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic stress is a major public health issue, and social media platforms like Twitter provide valuable data for understanding stress experiences. There's a need for better automated methods to detect self-reported chronic stress in social media posts, leveraging the high comorbidity between chronic stress and other mental health conditions.

Method: The paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD), then fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset for chronic stress detection. This approach leverages clinical comorbidity relationships between stress and related disorders.

Result: StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score on chronic stress detection, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. It shows +1% F1 improvement over vanilla RoBERTa. Evaluation on Dreaddit dataset shows 81% F1, demonstrating successful transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.

Conclusion: Cross-condition transfer learning from clinically related mental health disorders provides stronger representations for chronic stress detection than general language models or broad mental health training. The approach effectively leverages comorbidity relationships and demonstrates transferability across different stress contexts.

Abstract: The prevalence of chronic stress represents a significant public health concern, with social media platforms like Twitter serving as important venues for individuals to share their experiences. This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.

*Himel Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative interpretability study of transformer-based bias detection models using SHAP explanations reveals architectural differences in how models operationalize linguistic bias, with domain-adaptive models showing better alignment between attribution strength and prediction outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail, despite their heavy use in journalistic analysis and media accountability. The study aims to understand how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias through interpretability analysis.

Method: Comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: 1) bias detector fine-tuned on BABE dataset, and 2) domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa fine-tuned on BABE dataset. Used SHAP-based explanations to analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions.

Result: Both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language but differ substantially in signal integration. Bias detector assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than true positives, leading to systematic over-flagging of neutral content. Domain-adaptive model shows better attribution-prediction alignment and produces 63% fewer false positives. Errors arise from discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues.

Conclusion: Interpretability-aware evaluation is crucial for bias detection systems. Architectural and training choices critically affect model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts, with domain-adaptive approaches showing superior performance and better alignment with prediction outcomes.

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

*Dingmin Wang,Ji Ma,Shankar Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adaptive prompting strategy splits retrieved information into chunks for LLM question answering, balancing relevant vs irrelevant info while using fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While longer contexts in retrieval-augmented generation help incorporate targeted knowledge, they also introduce more irrelevant information that degrades LLM performance.

Method: Design adaptive prompting strategy that splits retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompts LLM to answer using each chunk, with adjustable chunk size for trade-off control.

Result: Experimental results on three open-domain QA datasets show adaptive strategy matches standard prompting performance while using fewer tokens. Analysis reveals LLMs often generate incorrect answers instead of declining when information is insufficient.

Conclusion: The adaptive prompting approach effectively balances relevant/irrelevant information trade-off, but highlights need for research to enhance LLMs' ability to decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

*Kaustubh Dhole*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using intermediate attention layer token distributions to generate adversarial examples for LLM evaluation pipelines, showing performance drops but with grammatical limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage mechanistic interpretability findings that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses to create more plausible and internally consistent adversarial examples than prompt-based or gradient-based attacks.

Method: Extract tokens from intermediate attention layers to serve as adversarial perturbations, using LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B as both generator and evaluator on the ArgQuality dataset for argument quality assessment.

Result: Attention-based adversarial examples cause measurable performance drops while maintaining semantic similarity to original inputs, but substitutions from certain layers/positions introduce grammatical degradation limiting practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Intermediate-layer representations show promise as principled adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM evaluation pipelines, but current limitations exist due to grammatical issues from certain token substitutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

*Yukun Zhang,Stefan Elbl Droguett,Samyak Jain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses financial QA errors by implementing a multi-retriever RAG system with domain-specific training (SecBERT) and latest LLMs, achieving SOTA performance but still below human expert level.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial numerical reasoning QA tasks are challenging due to lack of domain-specific finance knowledge and complex multi-step numeric reasoning, even with recent LLM advances.

Method: Implemented multi-retriever RAG system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, using SecBERT encoder for domain-specific training and latest LLMs for generation.

Result: Domain-specific training with SecBERT surpassed baseline FinQA model; best prompt-based LLM achieved SOTA with >7% improvement but still below human expert performance. Larger models benefit more from external knowledge than hallucination loss.

Conclusion: Domain-specific training enhances performance, latest LLMs show improved few-shot numerical reasoning, and there's a trade-off between hallucination loss and external knowledge gains that favors larger models.

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

*Conrad Borchers,Manit Patel,Seiyon M. Lee,Anthony F. Botelho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an analytics framework that separates student response content from teacher grading tendencies to make scoring judgments more transparent and auditable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated scoring systems often conflate what students actually wrote with how teachers grade, making it difficult to distinguish genuine student understanding from teacher-specific scoring tendencies.

Method: The framework uses teacher histories as dynamic priors and text representations from sentence embeddings, with centering and residualization to address prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify signal contributions, and a projection technique surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection.

Result: Teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; combining priors with content embeddings yields strongest results (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens content representation and reveals cases where semantic evidence supports understanding.

Conclusion: The framework transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

*Chulun Zhou,Chunkang Zhang,Guoxin Yu,Fandong Meng,Jie Zhou,Wai Lam,Mo Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HGMem introduces a hypergraph-based memory mechanism for multi-step RAG that captures higher-order correlations between facts, improving global reasoning compared to traditional passive memory storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG memory systems function as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts, overlooking crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts. This static nature limits representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts.

Method: HGMem represents memory as a hypergraph where hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging datasets for global sense-making show that HGMem consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: HGMem extends memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding, addressing limitations of existing passive memory designs in multi-step RAG systems.

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Motivation: To enable efficient long-context processing (up to 1M tokens) with limited computational budget, addressing both prefill-intensive (retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (tool-integrated reasoning) scenarios.

Method: LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA) - a sparse attention scheme that transforms existing full-attention models into sparse versions. Applied to LongCat-Flash during mid-training to create LongCat-Flash-Exp.

Result: Significant speed-ups in long-context scenarios, enabling processing of up to 1 million tokens. LongCat-Flash-Exp serves as a long-context foundation model for efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Conclusion: LoZA provides an effective approach to create sparse attention models from existing full-attention architectures, enabling practical long-context processing with computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RISE: Unsupervised framework using sparse auto-encoders to discover interpretable reasoning vectors in LLM activations, enabling behavior analysis and control without human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches to analyzing LLM reasoning rely on human-defined concepts at the word level, which is limited because it's infeasible to capture the full spectrum of reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space.

Method: Propose RISE framework that segments chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level steps, trains sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations to discover reasoning vectors (directions in activation space encoding distinct reasoning behaviors).

Result: SAEs uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors (reflection, backtracking), reveal separable regions in decoder column space, enable targeted interventions to control reasoning behaviors, capture structural properties like response length, and discover novel behaviors beyond human supervision including confidence-related vectors.

Conclusion: Unsupervised latent discovery via SAEs shows potential for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs, moving beyond supervised human-defined concepts to discover novel reasoning behaviors.

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Conclusion: Lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, providing practical solutions for deploying misinformation detection in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iCLP enables LLMs to generate compact latent plans for reasoning, improving accuracy, efficiency, and cross-domain generalization while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit textual plans for LLMs suffer from hallucinations and poor generalization across diverse tasks. Inspired by human subconscious implicit cognition, the authors aim to develop a more efficient and generalizable planning mechanism.

Method: iCLP framework: 1) Distills explicit plans from reasoning trajectories, 2) Learns discrete latent plan representations via vector-quantized autoencoder with codebook, 3) Fine-tunes LLMs on paired latent plans and reasoning steps to enable implicit planning.

Result: Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation show LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency with strong cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: iCLP successfully enables LLMs to perform implicit planning like human subconscious cognition, offering a more efficient and generalizable approach to reasoning while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily been driven by resource-rich research groups and industry partners. Due to the lack of on-premise computing resources required for increasingly complex models, many researchers are turning to cloud services like AWS SageMaker to train Hugging Face models. However, the steep learning curve of cloud platforms often presents a barrier for researchers accustomed to local environments. Existing documentation frequently leaves knowledge gaps, forcing users to seek fragmented information across the web. This demo paper aims to democratize cloud adoption by centralizing the essential information required for researchers to successfully train their first Hugging Face model on AWS SageMaker from scratch.

*Adi Shnaidman,Erin Feiglin,Osher Yaari,Efrat Mentel,Amit Levi,Raz Lapid*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for inference-time control of masked diffusion language models using activation steering from contrastive examples, without simulating denoising trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have gained attention for their mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance, but lack effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering.

Method: An activation-steering framework that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, applied at every reverse-diffusion step without simulating the denoising trajectory.

Result: Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining steering effects across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs. response).

Conclusion: The framework provides an efficient inference-time control mechanism for MDLMs, enabling reliable attribute modulation through activation steering without complex trajectory simulation.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

*Changhao Song,Yazhou Zhang,Hui Gao,Chang Yang,Peng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEWM is a Large Emotional World Model that incorporates emotion modeling alongside physical states to better predict emotion-driven social behaviors, addressing a gap in current LLMs that focus mainly on physical-world regularities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs primarily model physical-world regularities but lack systematic exploration of emotional factors, which are crucial for understanding human decision-making and social behaviors. The paper demonstrates that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance.

Method: Proposes LEWM that explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions. Constructs the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset integrating emotion into causal relationships to enable reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states.

Result: LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating emotional modeling into world models is important for understanding human social behaviors and decision-making, and LEWM demonstrates effective integration of emotional factors while maintaining general world modeling capabilities.

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

*Qipeng Wang,Rui Sheng,Yafei Li,Huamin Qu,Yushi Sun,Min Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedKGI is a clinical diagnostic framework that integrates medical knowledge graphs to ground LLM reasoning, uses information gain for efficient questioning, and maintains structured state tracking to improve diagnostic accuracy and dialogue efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with clinical diagnosis due to three key limitations: generating hallucinated medical content, asking redundant/infficient questions, and losing coherence in multi-turn dialogues, which prevents them from emulating real clinical diagnostic reasoning.

Method: MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph to constrain reasoning to validated ontologies, selects questions based on information gain for diagnostic efficiency, and uses OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across dialogue turns.

Result: Experiments show MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Conclusion: The MedKGI framework successfully addresses key limitations of current LLMs in clinical diagnosis by grounding reasoning in verified knowledge, optimizing question selection, and maintaining dialogue coherence, enabling more effective clinical diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pat-SPECTER model outperforms other language similarity models in predicting credible patent-paper citations, showing US patents cite less semantically similar papers due to duty of candor requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for a language similarity model that can effectively handle both patents and scientific publications simultaneously, as existing models may not adequately capture the semantic relationships between these two distinct document types.

Method: Develop Pat-SPECTER by fine-tuning SPECTER2 model on patents, then evaluate eight language similarity models in a horse race-style assessment using credible Patent-Paper Citations as prediction target.

Result: Pat-SPECTER performs best among tested models in predicting patent-paper citations. In real-world scenarios, it effectively separates and predicts patent-paper pairs. Analysis reveals US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other jurisdictions, supporting the duty of candor hypothesis.

Conclusion: The fine-tuned Pat-SPECTER model is superior for patent-paper similarity tasks, provides practical utility for separating and predicting patent-paper relationships, and offers evidence that legal requirements (duty of candor) affect citation patterns in US patents.

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

### [34] [Joint Selection for Large-Scale Pre-Training Data via Policy Gradient-based Mask Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24265)
*Ziqing Fan,Yuqiao Xian,Yan Sun,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATAMASK is an efficient joint learning framework for large-scale pre-training data selection that optimizes both quality and diversity metrics simultaneously, achieving significant performance improvements with only 10% of the data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current data selection methods for trillion-scale pre-training datasets either focus on quality metrics (which show diminishing returns) or diversity metrics (which remove valuable high-quality samples), limiting LLM capabilities. There's a need for an efficient joint optimization approach.

Method: DATAMASK treats data selection as a mask learning problem using policy gradient optimization: iteratively samples data masks, computes policy gradients based on predefined objectives, and updates mask sampling logits. Includes acceleration enhancements to reduce selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithms.

Result: Selected 10% subset (FineWeb-Mask) from 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset. Achieved 3.2% improvement on 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on 7B MoE model across 12 diverse tasks. Enabled joint learning exploration at trillion-scale token level.

Conclusion: DATAMASK provides an efficient framework for joint optimization of quality and diversity metrics in large-scale pre-training data selection, overcoming limitations of single-metric approaches and significantly improving model performance with much smaller data subsets.

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

*Jonathan Schmoll,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic evaluation of LLMs for EU Taxonomy compliance shows they can identify economic activities moderately well but fail at predicting financial KPIs, suggesting they're better as assistive tools than full automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EU Taxonomy compliance is manual and resource-intensive, but LLM automation research is hindered by lack of public benchmark datasets. The paper aims to address this gap and evaluate LLMs' potential for automating compliance workflows.

Method: Created a novel structured dataset from 190 corporate reports with ground-truth economic activities and KPIs. Conducted systematic evaluation of LLMs on core compliance workflow, comparing qualitative (activity identification) vs quantitative (KPI prediction) tasks using multi-step agentic frameworks and zero-shot settings.

Result: LLMs show moderate success in qualitative activity identification (with agentic framework modestly improving precision) but comprehensively fail at quantitative KPI prediction in zero-shot. Paradoxically, concise metadata often outperforms full unstructured reports. Model confidence scores are poorly calibrated.

Conclusion: LLMs are not ready for full EU Taxonomy compliance automation but can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. The released dataset provides a public benchmark for future research in this domain.

Abstract: The manual, resource-intensive process of complying with the EU Taxonomy presents a significant challenge for companies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.

Motivation: Complex reasoning problems involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. Text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings.

Method: FIGR integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. It externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving, adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked.

Conclusion: Figure-guided multimodal reasoning enhances the stability and reliability of complex reasoning by enabling more coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone.

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous financial LLMs focused mainly on knowledge enhancement, but increasing complexity of financial services requires models with robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities beyond just domain knowledge.

Method: Multi-stage training: 1) Continual Pre-training on financial corpora for knowledge base, 2) Fine-grained Post-training pipeline with increasing specificity: Financial SFT → Finance Reasoning RL → Finance Agentic RL → General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios.

Result: QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in respective capabilities.

Conclusion: The fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is validated and poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.

Abstract: Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application. While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.
  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities. These findings validate our motivation and suggest that this fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WM-SAR reformulates sarcasm understanding as world model reasoning, decomposing literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM agents, then using inconsistency and intention scores with logistic regression for interpretable sarcasm detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sarcasm detection approaches rely on black-box predictions without structural explanations of cognitive factors. Sarcasm involves mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations/intentions, but frameworks explicitly modeling these components are limited.

Method: Proposes WM-SAR: decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. Quantifies discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation as inconsistency score, plus intention score. Integrates these signals with lightweight logistic regression for final sarcasm probability.

Result: WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods on sarcasm detection benchmarks. Ablation studies show integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.

Conclusion: The world model inspired reasoning approach successfully decomposes sarcasm understanding into interpretable components, leveraging LLM reasoning while maintaining transparent decision structure, offering both performance gains and explainability.

Abstract: Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation by mimicking human skimming behavior, using random section masking and NLI-based contrastive objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing transformer models struggle with long document representation in specialized fields like law and medicine. Sparse attention is resource-intensive, hierarchical transformers lack explainability, while humans efficiently skim documents by focusing on important sections.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that randomly masks document sections and uses natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objectives to align masked sections with relevant parts while distancing them from unrelated ones, mimicking human skimming behavior.

Result: Experiments on legal and biomedical texts show significant improvements in both accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mimics human skimming strategies to create richer and more efficient long document representations, demonstrating effectiveness in specialized domains like law and medicine.

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: Comparison of text summarization approaches for less-resourced languages, finding multilingual fine-tuned mT5 outperforms most methods including zero-shot LLMs, with LLM-as-judge reliability concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages.

Method: Compares various approaches: zero-shot prompting of LLMs (large and small), fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with/without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer, and an LLM translation pipeline (translate to English, summarize, translate back).

Result: Variation across LLMs in performance across similar parameter sizes; multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics; LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

Conclusion: Multilingual fine-tuning approaches show promise for less-resourced language summarization, while LLM-based evaluation methods may need careful consideration for such languages.

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

TL;DR: A language model that cleans scientific abstracts by removing extraneous content like copyright statements and metadata to improve downstream text analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific abstracts often contain extraneous information (copyright statements, metadata, etc.) that distorts text analysis, especially for similarity comparisons and embeddings.

Method: Developed an open-source, easy-to-integrate language model specifically designed to automatically identify and remove clutter from English-language scientific abstracts.

Result: The model is conservative and precise, alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts, and improves information content of standard-length embeddings.

Conclusion: The introduced model effectively cleans scientific abstracts, enhancing the quality of downstream text analysis by removing distorting extraneous content.

Abstract: Scientific abstracts are often used as proxies for the content and thematic focus of research publications. However, a significant share of published abstracts contains extraneous information-such as publisher copyright statements, section headings, author notes, registrations, and bibliometric or bibliographic metadata-that can distort downstream analyses, particularly those involving document similarity or textual embeddings. We introduce an open-source, easy-to-integrate language model designed to clean English-language scientific abstracts by automatically identifying and removing such clutter. We demonstrate that our model is both conservative and precise, alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts and improves information content of standard-length embeddings.

TL;DR: A revision platform for IELTS writing preparation using transformer-based AES and adaptive feedback shows significant score improvements, though best as supplement to human instruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IELTS preparation lacks personalized feedback tailored to the IELTS writing rubric, creating a need for automated systems that can provide targeted guidance.

Method: Design-Based Research (DBR) approach with iterative cycles: early rule-based systems, then DistilBERT transformer with regression head for scoring, followed by adaptive feedback implementation. Platform separates conversational guidance from writing interface to reduce cognitive load.

Result: Transformer model achieved MAE of 0.66 and positive R². Adaptive feedback showed statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504). Conservative surface-level corrections more reliable than aggressive structural interventions.

Conclusion: Automated feedback functions best as supplement to human instruction. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays. Future work needs longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

### [43] [Paragraph Segmentation Revisited: Towards a Standard Task for Structuring Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24517)
*Fabian Retkowski,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces paragraph segmentation for speech transcripts, creates two benchmarks (TEDPara and YTSegPara), proposes a constrained-decoding method for LLMs to insert paragraph breaks, and develops MiniSeg model that achieves SOTA accuracy for joint chapter/paragraph prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech transcripts are often unstructured word streams that are hard to read and repurpose. Paragraph segmentation is missing as a structuring step in speech processing, and there's a lack of robust benchmarks for this task in the speech domain.

Method: 1) Created two benchmarks: TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels). 2) Proposed constrained-decoding formulation for LLMs to insert paragraph breaks while preserving original transcripts. 3) Developed MiniSeg, a compact model that achieves SOTA accuracy and can be extended hierarchically for joint chapter/paragraph prediction.

Result: Established paragraph segmentation as a standardized task, created first benchmarks for speech domain, showed MiniSeg achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and demonstrated hierarchical extension for joint chapter/paragraph prediction with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: The paper successfully establishes paragraph segmentation as a practical, standardized task in speech processing through new benchmarks, methods, and models that enable structured, readable speech transcripts.

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

*Muhammad Abdullahi Said,Muhammad Sammani Sani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM safety alignment doesn't transfer zero-shot from English to other languages; HausaSafety dataset reveals Complex Interference mechanism where safety depends on language-temporal framing interactions, not simple degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The dangerous assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages in LLMs integrated into critical global infrastructure, creating blind spots for Global South users facing localized threats.

Method: Systematic audit of GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus using HausaSafety adversarial dataset with West African threat scenarios; 2x4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations testing language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing interactions.

Result: Found Complex Interference mechanism instead of simple safety degradation; Reverse Linguistic effect (Claude safer in Hausa than English); profound Temporal Asymmetry (past-tense bypasses defenses, future-triggers hyper-conservatism); 9.2x disparity between safest/vulnerable configurations.

Conclusion: Current models rely on superficial heuristics, creating Safety Pockets that expose Global South users; propose Invariant Alignment paradigm shift for safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

*Chaodong Tong,Qi Zhang,Jiayang Gao,Lei Jiang,Yanbing Liu,Nannan Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HaluNet is a lightweight neural framework that combines token-level probability uncertainty with semantic representation uncertainty for efficient hallucination detection in LLM-based QA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate hallucinations (factual errors/fabricated content) in QA tasks. Existing hallucination detection methods focus on single uncertainty types and overlook the complementarity between token-level probability uncertainty and internal semantic representation uncertainty.

Method: HaluNet integrates multi-granular token-level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. It uses a multi-branch architecture that adaptively fuses what the model knows with uncertainty expressed in outputs, enabling efficient one-pass detection.

Result: Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context.

Conclusion: HaluNet demonstrates potential for real-time hallucination detection in LLM-based QA systems by effectively leveraging complementary uncertainty sources.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a benchmark that assesses language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge, enabling more faithful evaluation of pure reasoning ability.

Method: Developed KCL with two components: KCL-MCQA (283 multiple-choice questions with 1,103 precedents) and KCL-Essay (169 open-ended questions with 550 precedents and 2,739 rubrics). Provides question-level supporting precedents to disentangle reasoning from knowledge.

Result: Evaluation of 30+ models shows large performance gaps, especially in KCL-Essay, with reasoning-specialized models consistently outperforming general-purpose models.

Conclusion: KCL effectively measures legal reasoning independent of domain knowledge, reveals significant room for improvement in current models, and provides valuable resources for advancing legal AI research.

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge. KCL provides question-level supporting precedents, enabling a more faithful disentanglement of reasoning ability from parameterized knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CREST is a training-free method that steers LLM reasoning by identifying and suppressing inefficient cognitive behaviors via attention head interventions, improving accuracy while reducing token usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning with long chain-of-thought is inefficient (high latency from excessive tokens) and unstable (alternates between underthinking and overthinking). There's a need for more efficient and reliable reasoning without additional training.

Method: CREST has two components: (1) offline calibration to identify cognitive heads (correlated with behaviors like verification/backtracking) and derive head-specific steering vectors, (2) inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors, adaptively suppressing unproductive reasoning behaviors.

Result: Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering faster and more reliable LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: CREST provides a simple, effective, training-free pathway to improve LLM reasoning efficiency and reliability by steering cognitive behaviors through targeted attention head interventions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Youtu-LLM is a 1.96B parameter lightweight language model pre-trained from scratch with native agentic intelligence, featuring a novel MLA architecture with 128k context window and a progressive training curriculum from commonsense to STEM/agentic tasks, achieving SOTA performance for sub-2B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a lightweight language model that doesn't rely on distillation but instead develops intrinsic reasoning and planning capabilities from scratch, addressing the gap where small models typically lack native agentic intelligence while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Three key technical advancements: 1) Compact MLA architecture with STEM-oriented vocabulary supporting 128k context window; 2) Multi-stage training curriculum progressing from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks using 11T tokens; 3) Scalable agentic mid-training with diverse data construction for math, coding, and tool-use trajectories.

Result: Youtu-LLM sets new SOTA for sub-2B LLMs, achieving competitive performance on general benchmarks against larger models while significantly surpassing existing SOTA baselines on agent-specific tasks, demonstrating strong intrinsic agentic capabilities in lightweight models.

Conclusion: Lightweight models can possess strong native agentic intelligence when properly designed and trained, with Youtu-LLM showing that systematic cultivation of reasoning and planning capabilities through architectural innovations and progressive training curricula enables efficient yet powerful agentic models.

Abstract: We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

### [49] [Do Large Language Models Know What They Are Capable Of?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24661)
*Casey O. Barkan,Sid Black,Oliver Sourbut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are overconfident in predicting their task success, with overconfidence worsening during multi-step tasks. Some LLMs can learn from failure experiences to improve decision-making, but all LLMs make rational decisions based on their (overly optimistic) success estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can accurately predict their own task success, whether these predictions improve during multi-step tasks, and whether LLMs can learn from failure experiences to make better decisions in costly-failure scenarios.

Method: Tested multiple LLMs on their ability to predict task success, examined how predictions evolve during multi-step agentic tasks, and evaluated whether in-context failure experiences improve decision-making about pursuing tasks.

Result: All LLMs are overconfident but predict success better than random. Newer/larger models don't necessarily have better discriminatory power. Overconfidence worsens during multi-step tasks. Some LLMs reduce overconfidence with failure experiences, improving decision-making, while others don't. All LLMs make rational decisions based on their (flawed) success estimates.

Conclusion: Current LLM agents lack awareness of their own capabilities, hindering performance. This capability awareness issue has implications for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

*Maoyuan Li,Zhongsheng Wang,Haoyuan Li,Jiamou Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R-Debater is an agentic framework for multi-turn debates using argumentative memory and retrieval to generate consistent, evidence-based arguments across turns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current debate systems lack consistency across turns and proper evidence grounding. The paper aims to create a framework that maintains stance consistency, responds to opponents effectively, and supports claims with evidence by leveraging rhetorical memory principles.

Method: R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances. It uses retrieval grounding with structured planning to generate faithful, stance-aligned debates.

Result: Evaluated on ORCHID debates with 1,000-item retrieval corpus and 32 held-out debates across seven domains. Achieved higher single-turn (InspireScore) and multi-turn (Debatrix) scores compared to strong LLM baselines. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters confirmed better consistency and evidence use.

Conclusion: Combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns, demonstrating the effectiveness of argumentative memory in multi-turn debate generation.

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MUSIC is an unsupervised data augmentation method that creates multi-turn contrastive conversation pairs to train better multi-turn reward models for evaluating LLM conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-turn conversation evaluation relies heavily on costly human assessment. While multi-turn reward models offer a scalable alternative, existing training data (single-turn contrasts) fails to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: Proposes MUSIC (Multi-Step Instruction Contrast), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs with differences spanning multiple turns. Applied to the Skywork preference dataset to train a multi-turn RM based on Gemma-2-9B-Instruct.

Result: The MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, while maintaining performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-turn contrasts is crucial for building robust multi-turn reward models. MUSIC provides an effective unsupervised approach to enhance multi-turn RM training without compromising single-turn performance.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pathway enrichment methods have structural limitations including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states. Existing LLM evaluations for multi-omics analysis lack standardized benchmarks, relying on small curated datasets or ad hoc case studies.

Method: Developed BIOME-Bench through a rigorous four-stage workflow to evaluate two core LLM capabilities: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. Created evaluation protocols and conducted comprehensive experiments across multiple contemporary models.

Result: Existing models show substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

Conclusion: BIOME-Bench addresses the need for standardized evaluation in multi-omics pathway analysis, revealing current LLM limitations and providing a foundation for reproducible progress in this domain.

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

TL;DR: Semi-SMDNet: A semi-supervised multilingual depression detection network using teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and data augmentation to overcome language style variations and limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression detection from social media text is challenging due to different language styles, informal expressions, and lack of annotated data in many languages, creating a need for robust multilingual approaches that work with limited resources.

Method: Proposes Semi-SMDNet with teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning (multiple teacher models with soft voting), uncertainty-based threshold filtering for low-confidence pseudo-labels, and confidence-weighted training focusing on reliable samples.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets, significantly reduces performance gap between resource-rich and resource-limited settings, and demonstrates effectiveness across various situations.

Conclusion: The framework is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labeled resources are limited, offering a robust solution for multilingual depression detection from social media text.

Abstract: Detecting depression from social media text is still a challenging task. This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.

TL;DR: The paper conducts a test-time-compute aware evaluation of LLMs, finding MoE architectures balance performance and efficiency best, and identifies a saturation point where additional compute yields diminishing accuracy returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current literature overlooks the computational burden of generating long reasoning sequences in LLMs, while industrial applications require balancing accuracy with resource constraints and inference costs.

Method: Conducted test-time-compute aware evaluation of contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks, and analyzed accuracy gain per unit of compute over time.

Result: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture emerges as best for balancing performance and efficiency; identified saturation point where additional inference-time compute yields diminishing accuracy gains; derived emergent trend of accuracy gain per compute unit.

Conclusion: While extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations - there's a compute saturation point beyond which accuracy gains diminish, making MoE architectures optimal for practical deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

Conclusion: Sharing this approach provides inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula, addressing the growing need for ethical education in NLP.

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become more pervasive, integrating ethical considerations into NLP education has become essential. However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field's rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and "learning by teaching" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.

### [56] [Triangulation as an Acceptance Rule for Multilingual Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24842)
*Yanan Long*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Triangulation is a causal verification method for multilingual model circuits that requires necessity, sufficiency, and invariance across meaning-preserving language variants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual language models show unpredictable behavior across languages, scripts, and cultures, requiring causal explanations that survive interventions and cross-reference across meaning-preserving variants.

Method: Formalize reference families as predicate-preserving variants, introduce triangulation with three criteria (necessity, sufficiency, invariance), use automatic circuit discovery, and verify candidates through causal abstraction as approximate transformation scores over interchange interventions.

Result: Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance, enabling comparative experimental protocols across model families, language pairs, and tasks.

Conclusion: Triangulation establishes a causal verification framework for mechanistic claims in multilingual models, connecting to pragmatic interpretability and providing robust cross-lingual validation of discovered circuits.

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

*Srija Mukhopadhyay,Sathwik Reddy,Shruthi Muthukumar,Jisun An,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrivacyBench benchmark reveals RAG assistants leak user secrets up to 26.56% of the time, showing current AI architectures are unsafe for wide-scale deployment without privacy-by-design safeguards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized AI agents access sensitive user data (emails, chats, purchase histories), creating privacy risks when systems lack social-context awareness and unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being.

Method: Introduce PrivacyBench benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Test Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants and evaluate privacy-aware prompts.

Result: RAG assistants leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. Privacy-aware prompts reduce leakage to 5.12%, but retrieval mechanisms still access sensitive data indiscriminately, creating a single point of failure in the generator.

Conclusion: Current architectures are unsafe for wide-scale deployment. There's urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure ethical and inclusive web for everyone, as prompt-based mitigation only offers partial protection.

Abstract: Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.

### [58] [Big AI is accelerating the metacrisis: What can we do?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24863)
*Steven Bird*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper critiques Big AI's role in accelerating ecological, meaning, and language crises, arguing that language engineers are enabling harmful systems and calling for alternative, life-affirming NLP approaches centered on human and planetary flourishing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the convergence of ecological, meaning, and language crises into a "metacrisis," which Big AI is accelerating. The authors are concerned that language engineers are contributing to these problems by working on harmful systems without considering values, and they want to explore alternatives that prioritize human and planetary well-being.

Method: The paper appears to be a critical analysis and position paper rather than presenting a specific technical method. It critiques current NLP practices, identifies problems with the "scalability story," and calls for collective intelligence to design alternative approaches to NLP that are life-affirming and centered on human flourishing.

Result: The paper presents a critical diagnosis of current NLP/AI practices, identifying how language engineers are: 1) persisting with a failing scalability narrative, 2) supplying talent to harmful power structures (plutocrats/kleptocrats), and 3) creating technologies as if value-free. It establishes the urgent need for alternative approaches.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that there is an urgent need to explore alternatives to current NLP practices, applying collective intelligence to design a life-affirming future for NLP that centers human flourishing on a living planet, rather than continuing with value-free technological development that accelerates multiple crises.

Abstract: The world is in the grip of ecological, meaning, and language crises which are converging into a metacrisis. Big AI is accelerating them all. Language engineers are playing a central role, persisting with a scalability story that is failing humanity, supplying critical talent to plutocrats and kleptocrats, and creating new technologies as if the whole endeavour was value-free. We urgently need to explore alternatives, applying our collective intelligence to design a life-affirming future for NLP that is centered on human flourishing on a living planet.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Encyclo-K is a statement-based benchmark that uses knowledge statements from textbooks as the unit of curation, dynamically composing them into evaluation questions to address data contamination, enable multi-knowledge assessment, and reduce annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks have three key limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. The authors aim to create a more robust and scalable evaluation framework.

Method: Extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks, then dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. Each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive assessment.

Result: Experiments on 50+ LLMs show strong discriminative power: top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy. Reasoning models range from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%.

Conclusion: Encyclo-K provides a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements, addressing key limitations of existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mHC framework restores identity mapping in Hyper-Connections to fix training instability while maintaining performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyper-Connections (HC) improve performance but lose the identity mapping property of residual connections, causing training instability, scalability issues, and memory overhead.

Method: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) projects HC's residual connection space onto a specific manifold to restore identity mapping, with infrastructure optimization for efficiency.

Result: mHC enables effective large-scale training with performance improvements and superior scalability compared to HC.

Conclusion: mHC is a flexible, practical extension of HC that advances topological architecture design and foundational model evolution.

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

*Hengli Li,Zhaoxin Yu,Qi Shen,Chenxi Li,Mengmeng Wang,Tinglang Wu,Yipeng Kang,Yuxuan Wang,Song-Chun Zhu,Zixia Jia,Zilong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BEDA framework uses belief estimation as constraints to improve strategic dialogue performance across adversarial, cooperative, and negotiation settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work accurately estimates beliefs in strategic dialogue but lacks principled mechanisms to use those beliefs during generation, creating a gap between belief estimation and effective dialogue act execution.

Method: Formalizes adversarial and alignment dialogue acts, operationalizes them via probabilistic constraints, and implements BEDA framework with world set, belief estimator, and conditional generator that selects acts and generates utterances consistent with inferred beliefs.

Result: BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: improves success rate by at least 5.0 points on CKBG (up to 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano), achieves 9.3 point average improvement on Mutual Friends, and achieves optimal deal on CaSiNo negotiation.

Conclusion: Casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue across diverse settings.

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

*Minjun Zhao,Xinyu Zhang,Shuai Zhang,Deyang Li,Ruifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADOPT is a framework for optimizing prompts in multi-step LLM pipelines by modeling step dependencies and using text-gradient estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-step LLM pipelines are effective for complex tasks but their performance heavily depends on prompts at each step. Joint optimization is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies, causing existing methods to yield suboptimal or unstable results.

Method: ADOPT explicitly models dependencies between each LLM step and final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation (analogous to computing analytical derivatives). It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and uses a Shapley-based mechanism for adaptive resource allocation.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

Conclusion: ADOPT provides a systematic framework for optimizing prompts in multi-step LLM pipelines by addressing dependency modeling and gradient estimation challenges, offering superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

We introduce RESTOREx as a vital resource for detecting depressive symptoms in memes on social media through the Large Language Model (LLM) generated and human-annotated explanations. We introduce MAMAMemeia, a collaborative multi-agent multi-aspect discussion framework grounded in the clinical psychology method of Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) Competencies.

### [65] [Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026)
*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Thought Gestalt (TG) is a recurrent Transformer that models language at both token and sentence-level "thought" states, improving efficiency and relational reasoning over standard GPT models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformer language models rely too much on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, failing to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events. This leads to brittleness in relational reasoning (like the reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. Human cognition, in contrast, converts linguistic input into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory.

Method: TG is a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels: tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. It generates tokens one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. Both token and sentence representations use the same model parameters and are trained with a single next-token cross-entropy objective. Gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize parameters generating earlier sentence vectors.

Result: In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization tasks, specifically on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Conclusion: The Thought Gestalt model successfully addresses limitations of standard Transformer language models by incorporating cognitive-inspired hierarchical representations, leading to improved data efficiency, parameter efficiency, and better relational reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaGReS is a redundancy-aware context selection framework for RAG that optimizes relevance while minimizing redundancy under token budget constraints, eliminating manual tuning and providing theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard top-k retrieval in RAG often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation quality, creating a need for smarter context selection.

Method: AdaGReS performs greedy selection under token-budget constraints using marginal gains from an objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties, with automatic calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter.

Result: Experiments on open-domain QA (Natural Questions) and biomedical corpus show consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, leading to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness.

Conclusion: AdaGReS effectively addresses redundancy in RAG context selection with theoretical guarantees, eliminating manual tuning while improving performance across diverse domains and settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

TL;DR: This paper presents a monocular depth estimation method for robotic surgery that adapts Depth Anything V2's synthetic priors using DV-LORA to handle specular endoscopic environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 98.1% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods for robotic surgery are fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments and suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces.

Method: Leverages Depth Anything V2's high-fidelity synthetic priors and adapts them to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA) with minimal parameters. Also introduces a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on SCARED dataset.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 98.1% accuracy (< 1.25) and reduces Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the synthetic-to-real gap for surgical depth estimation, handling challenging specular environments while maintaining efficiency through parameter-efficient adaptation.

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current urban warfare training assessment methods rely on costly sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy for evaluating cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills in Enter and Clear the Room drills.

Method: Computer vision models extract 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories from training videos. Task-specific metrics measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination, feeding into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis hierarchy with weighted combination for overall scores.

Result: Demonstrated approach with real-world ECR drills, providing actionable domain-specific metrics capturing individual and team performance. Supports After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards in Gamemaster and GIFT for intuitive feedback.

Conclusion: Video-based assessment enables scalable evaluation within Synthetic Training Environments. Limitations include tracking difficulties and ground-truth validation. Future work includes 3D video analysis expansion.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient long video processing by compressing lengthy sequences into manageable contexts while preserving important visual details, allowing autoregressive video models to maintain long history memory without excessive computational cost.

Method: PFP uses a neural network structure with explicit pretraining objective to preserve high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions, compressing 20-second videos into ~5k length contexts while maintaining perceptual appearance of random frames.

Result: The model successfully compresses videos while preserving frame details, and pretrained models can be fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, achieving long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss.

Conclusion: PFP provides an effective framework for video compression that balances context length reduction with detail preservation, enabling practical long-term memory for video models through appropriate neural architecture trade-offs.

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

TL;DR: Proposes lifelong domain adaptation for 3D human pose estimation to handle non-stationary target datasets, addressing catastrophic forgetting through a novel GAN framework with multi-aware 3D pose generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D HPE methods rely on controlled environment data and don't generalize well to diverse real-world scenarios. Existing domain adaptation approaches overlook non-stationary target pose datasets and suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to multiple domains sequentially.

Method: Introduces lifelong domain adaptation for 3D HPE with a GAN framework containing 3D pose generators, 2D pose discriminator, and 3D pose estimator. Features a novel 3D pose generator with pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge integration to adapt to current domain while preserving previous knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets, effectively mitigating domain shifts and aligning original/augmented poses while combating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: First to introduce lifelong domain adaptation to 3D HPE, successfully addressing challenges of adapting to non-stationary target domains while preserving knowledge from previous domains through innovative multi-aware GAN framework.

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning pipeline transforms pediatric T1-weighted MRIs into synthetic CTs for cranial bone segmentation and suture analysis, enabling non-invasive evaluation of cranial development without radiation exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current imaging methods have limitations: CT exposes children to ionizing radiation, while MRI cannot visualize cranial sutures or assess bone density. There's a need for non-invasive methods to evaluate pediatric cranial development and suture ossification for diagnosing growth-related cephalic disorders.

Method: Proposes a deep learning pipeline that transforms T1-weighted MRIs of children (0.2-2 years) into synthetic CTs (sCTs). The method predicts detailed cranial bone segmentation, generates suture probability heatmaps, and derives direct suture segmentation from these heatmaps using robust, domain-specific variational autoencoders.

Result: sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained 85% Dice coefficient across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one-sided tests (TOST p < 0.05).

Conclusion: This is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework enabling suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, bridging critical gaps in non-invasive cranial evaluation by generating perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs.

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

*Charith Wickrema,Eliza Mace,Hunter Brown,Heidys Cabrera,Nick Krall,Matthew O'Neill,Shivangi Sarkar,Lowell Weissman,Eric Hughes,Guido Zarrella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper explores scaling behaviors for training foundation models on massive-scale electro-optical satellite data, finding that performance remains data-limited even at petascale training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current scaling laws for AI models are well-established for natural images with abundant internet data, but poorly understood for high-value domains like remote sensing where robust domain-specialized encoders are needed for multimodal applications.

Method: Used over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox to train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, analyzing scaling behaviors at petascale and reporting success/failure modes.

Result: Even at petascale training, performance remains consistent with a data-limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one, with implications for bridging domain gaps across additional remote sensing modalities.

Conclusion: The practical insights inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules for advancing frontier-scale remote sensing foundation models, highlighting the continued importance of scaling data alongside model capacity.

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

*Yipei Wang,Qianye Yang,Lior Drukker,Aris T. Papageorghiou,Yipeng Hu,J. Alison Noble*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a bi-level optimization framework for automated ultrasound skill assessment that predicts skills based on task performance quality without predefined skill ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound skill assessment relies on subjective expert supervision. Existing automated methods use supervised learning with predetermined skill factors, limiting analysis to assumed influential factors.

Method: A novel bi-level optimization framework with two components: a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor. The networks are optimized jointly by simultaneous refinement, assessing skills based on how well tasks are performed on acquired ultrasound images.

Result: Validated on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of fetal head scanning. Demonstrates feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by quantifying optimized task performance as a skill indicator.

Conclusion: The framework successfully quantifies ultrasound skills through task performance without manual skill ratings, offering an objective and automated alternative to traditional subjective assessment methods.

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

TL;DR: MGML framework for brain tumor segmentation with incomplete multimodal MRI data, using meta-guided adaptive fusion and consistency regularization to handle missing modalities without architecture changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical MRI data often has incomplete modalities, making it challenging to fully utilize available information for lesion segmentation. Need to maximize use of incomplete multimodal data.

Method: Two-component framework: 1) Meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) that integrates information from available modalities with adaptive soft-label supervision, and 2) Consistency regularization module to enhance segmentation and improve robustness. No architecture changes needed.

Result: Superior performance on BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. On BraTS2020, achieved average Dice scores of 87.55 (WT), 79.36 (TC), and 62.67 (ET) across 15 missing modality combinations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MGML effectively handles incomplete multimodal MRI data through meta-guided learning, improving segmentation performance without modifying model architecture, making it practical for clinical applications with missing modalities.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

TL;DR: A novel cross-view geo-localization system using DINOv2 backbone with convolution adapter, multi-scale channel reallocation, and MoE-enhanced feature aggregation to address view-point discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view geo-localization faces significant challenges due to view-point discrepancies between query and database images, which hinder effective feature aggregation and alignment.

Method: Three key improvements: 1) DINOv2 backbone with convolution adapter fine-tuning, 2) multi-scale channel reallocation module for spatial representation diversity, 3) improved aggregation module with Mixture-of-Experts routing in cross-attention framework.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets with fewer trained parameters compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively addresses cross-view discrepancies through adaptive feature processing and achieves state-of-the-art performance with parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis surgery using computer vision and machine learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microanastomosis requires precise surgical skills, but current assessment methods are subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. There's a need for automated, objective evaluation systems to improve surgical training and competency assessment.

Method: Three-component AI framework: 1) YOLO and DeepSORT for instrument tip tracking, 2) self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering for segmentation, 3) supervised classification for gesture proficiency evaluation.

Result: Achieved 92.4% frame-level action segmentation accuracy and 85.5% overall skill classification accuracy on 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos, effectively replicating expert evaluations.

Conclusion: The AI framework provides objective, real-time feedback for microsurgical education, enabling standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features.

TL;DR: T2VAttack: First comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on Text-to-Video diffusion models, revealing vulnerabilities through semantic and temporal attack objectives using prompt manipulation techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite rapid advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models generating high-quality videos, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored, creating a critical security gap.

Method: Proposes T2VAttack with two attack objectives (semantic for video-text alignment, temporal for temporal dynamics) and two attack methods: T2VAttack-S (replaces critical words with synonyms via greedy search) and T2VAttack-I (iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation).

Result: Evaluation on state-of-the-art T2V models (ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, HunyuanVideo) shows even minor prompt modifications (single word substitution/insertion) cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics.

Conclusion: Current T2V diffusion models have critical vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks through prompt manipulation, highlighting the need for improved robustness in video generation systems.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel view extrapolation method for autonomous driving that uses deformable 4D Gaussians and diffusion models without expensive sensors or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing view extrapolation methods rely on expensive sensors (LiDAR) or labor-intensive annotations (3D bounding boxes, lane markings), limiting real-world deployment. The paper aims to achieve high-quality view extrapolation using only images and optional camera poses.

Method: 1) Estimate global static and per-frame dynamic point clouds from images/camera poses; 2) Use deformable 4D Gaussian framework for scene reconstruction; 3) Train video diffusion model on degraded renders from initial 4D Gaussian model; 4) Iteratively refine progressively shifted Gaussian renderings using diffusion model, then use enhanced results to retrain 4DGS; 5) Repeat until reaching target extrapolated viewpoints.

Result: The method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating effective view extrapolation without expensive sensor dependencies.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully achieves high-quality view extrapolation for autonomous driving scenarios using only images and optional camera poses, eliminating the need for expensive sensors or labor-intensive annotations, making it more practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current satellite-based surface change detection faces challenges from atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts, limiting sensitivity for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring.

Method: Train an inpainting model based on SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions using globally distributed data across diverse climates and land cover types.

Result: Method detects earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake with 3x lower detection thresholds than baselines, achieving higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors.

Conclusion: Deep learning approach leveraging temporal redundancy enables unprecedented sensitivity for surface change detection, providing a path toward automated global-scale monitoring using freely available satellite data.

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GCA-ResUNet: A lightweight CNN-based medical image segmentation framework with Grouped Coordinate Attention module that improves global context modeling while maintaining computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing U-Net architectures struggle with long-range contextual dependencies in multi-organ segmentation and low-contrast regions due to their local receptive fields. Transformer-based methods address this but require high computational resources and large datasets, making them impractical for resource-constrained clinical environments.

Method: Proposes GCA-ResUNet with a plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module that: 1) decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to handle semantic heterogeneity across channels, and 2) integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes.

Result: Achieves Dice scores of 86.11% on Synapse and 92.64% on ACDC benchmarks, outperforming both CNN and Transformer-based methods including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. Shows consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail due to over-reliance on unstable appearance-based features like shadows, glare, and local textures, which are ambiguous in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes GASeg with three key components: 1) Differentiable Box-Counting (DBC) module that quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from geometric and appearance feature streams, 2) Topological Augmentation (TopoAug) that applies morphological operators to simulate real-world ambiguities, and 3) GALoss that enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric and appearance features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating the effectiveness of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Conclusion: Topological information provides stable structural representations that help overcome appearance ambiguities in self-supervised semantic segmentation, leading to improved performance across multiple challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Motivation: Recovering 3D structure of unknown spacecraft during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) is challenging due to dynamic lighting conditions in space. Standard 3DGS requires static scenes, but space imagery has rapidly changing illumination that affects both reconstruction quality and downstream pose estimation tasks.

Method: Uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model for geometry and appearance representation. Incorporates prior knowledge of Sun's position (estimated by servicer spacecraft) into training pipeline to improve photometric quality. This adaptation allows 3DGS to handle dynamic lighting conditions in space.

Result: Experimental studies show the proposed solution enables 3DGS models to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space. The models successfully reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion effects, improving photometric accuracy for downstream pose estimation tasks.

Conclusion: Incorporating sun position knowledge into 3DGS training effectively addresses dynamic lighting challenges in spaceborne imagery, enabling accurate 3D reconstruction and photometric quality necessary for spacecraft pose estimation during RPO operations.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hilbert-VLM: A two-stage fusion framework combining Hilbert-enhanced SAM2 for 3D medical image segmentation with VLM-guided disease classification, achieving 82.35% Dice score and 78.85% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs show promise for medical diagnosis but struggle with 3D multimodal image processing - specifically integrating complementary information and detecting subtle pathological features in complex medical images.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) HilbertMed-SAM module with redesigned SAM2 architecture using Hilbert space-filling curves in Mamba SSM scanning to preserve spatial locality, plus Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention and scale-aware decoder for lesion segmentation; 2) Prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks with textual attributes to guide VLM for disease classification.

Result: Achieves 82.35% Dice score on BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark and 78.85% diagnostic classification accuracy, demonstrating improved accuracy for medical VLM-based analysis.

Conclusion: Hilbert-VLM offers substantial potential to improve accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis by effectively handling 3D multimodal medical images through innovative spatial locality preservation and prompt-enhanced VLM guidance.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

TL;DR: CVC is a flow-based diffusion editing framework that corrects velocity errors in latent trajectories to improve semantic consistency and structural fidelity during image distribution transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flow-based diffusion editing methods suffer from accumulated velocity errors in latent trajectories, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity when transforming between source and target image distributions without explicit inversion.

Method: Proposes Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC) that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem. Introduces a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism that decomposes latent evolution into structure-preserving and semantically-guided branches. Applies posterior-consistent updates derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction to compensate for velocity errors and maintain fidelity to the true flow.

Result: CVC achieves stable and interpretable latent dynamics with faithful reconstruction and smooth local semantic conversion. Experiments show superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: CVC provides a principled framework for flow-based diffusion editing that addresses velocity error accumulation through mathematically grounded error compensation, resulting in improved semantic consistency and structural preservation during image distribution transformations.

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FitControler is a learnable plug-in module for virtual try-on models that enables customized garment fit control, addressing both layout delineation and garment rendering challenges for realistic VTON.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VTON methods focus on faithful garment detail rendering but neglect garment fit - a fundamental element in fashion design that shapes holistic style. Garment fit (how garments align with the body) is crucial for realistic virtual try-on but has been overlooked in existing approaches.

Method: FitControler features: 1) A fit-aware layout generator that redraws body-garment layouts conditioned on garment-agnostic representations, and 2) A multi-scale fit injector that delivers layout cues for layout-driven VTON. The system is trained on Fit4Men dataset with 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits.

Result: FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. The method introduces two fit consistency metrics for evaluation and shows strong performance through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The paper introduces fit-aware VTON as an important direction, presents FitControler as a versatile plug-in solution, and releases the Fit4Men dataset to advance research in garment fit control for virtual try-on applications.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

TL;DR: Structure-guided 2D Gaussian Splatting improves compression efficiency by coupling image structure with representation capacity and quantization precision while maintaining fast decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) methods allocate representation capacity and parameter precision without considering image structure, limiting rate-distortion efficiency at low bitrates.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Structure-guided initialization that assigns Gaussians based on spatial structural priors, 2) Adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters that gives higher precision to small Gaussians in complex regions, 3) Geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions.

Result: Substantially improves representational power and RD performance while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Reduces BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K compared to baseline GSImage.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS effectively couples image structure with representation capacity and quantization precision, achieving superior rate-distortion efficiency while preserving the fast decoding speed of 2DGS.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-guided segmentation methods treat it as one-shot grounding, which limits verification, refocusing, and refinement when initial localization is wrong. There's a need for iterative reasoning and refinement capabilities.

Method: Proposes RSAgent, an agentic MLLM that interleaves reasoning and action via multi-turn tool invocations. It queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises spatial hypotheses iteratively. Uses a two-stage training framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with task-specific rewards.

Result: Achieves 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test (9% improvement over Seg-Zero-7B) and 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: RSAgent's agentic approach with multi-turn reasoning and tool invocations effectively addresses limitations of one-shot segmentation methods, enabling iterative refinement and achieving superior segmentation performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Motivation: Long-form video editing faces computational challenges from joint editing and DDIM inversion across extended sequences, with exponential cost increases that limit scalability.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Motion analysis using SSIM and Optical Flow to skip editing of low-motion frames, 2) Pipelined task scheduling that splits videos into segments for parallel DDIM inversion and joint editing, 3) Neural network-based interpolation to smooth border frames and interpolate skipped frames.

Result: PipeFlow achieves up to 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT), with editing time scaling linearly with video length rather than exponentially.

Conclusion: PipeFlow enables scalable editing of long videos by dividing them into segments, allowing theoretically infinite video editing without the growing per-frame computational overhead of existing methods.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based anisotropic diffusion framework for image denoising that learns optimal diffusion actions through deep Q-learning, outperforming traditional diffusion methods and competing with deep CNN approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional anisotropic diffusion methods use explicit diffusion operators that are not well-adapted to complex image structures, limiting their performance compared to modern learning-based approaches. The authors aim to create a more adaptive diffusion-based denoiser.

Method: A trainable anisotropic diffusion framework using reinforcement learning. The denoising process is modeled as a series of naive diffusion actions, with the optimal order learned through deep Q-learning. This creates a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process that adapts to different image structures.

Result: The proposed method outperforms existing diffusion-based denoising methods and competes with representative deep CNN-based methods. It effectively removes three types of common noise patterns.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning can successfully enhance anisotropic diffusion for image denoising, creating an adaptive framework that bridges the gap between traditional diffusion methods and modern learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal data annotation is time-consuming and often contains noise, which degrades retrieval performance. Existing robust CMR methods fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate.

Method: Proposes Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL) framework: 1) Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) adjusts relative distance between positive/negative pairs for better discrimination; 2) Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) identifies pure, hard, and noisy subsets through cross-modal neighborhood consensus; 3) Constructs tailored optimization strategies for each subset to maximize data utilization while mitigating error propagation.

Result: Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Conclusion: NIRNL effectively addresses noisy label problem in cross-modal retrieval by combining margin preserving and neighbor-aware instance refining with fine-grained optimization strategies, achieving superior performance and robustness.

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinical pathology context and expert experience priors through PRM and EPGA modules significantly improves ocular disease recognition performance and interpretability, demonstrating the value of domain knowledge integration in medical AI systems.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

TL;DR: Proposes balanced hierarchical contrastive loss with decoupled learning strategy in DETR framework to address data imbalance and localization interference in fine-grained remote sensing object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for hierarchical fine-grained object detection have two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate learning, and (2) learning semantic relationships interferes with class-agnostic localization.

Method: Combines balanced hierarchical contrastive loss with decoupled learning strategy in DETR framework. The loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients across classes at each hierarchical level. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets for task-specific optimization.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations.

Conclusion: The proposed balanced hierarchical contrastive loss with decoupled learning effectively addresses data imbalance and localization interference in hierarchical fine-grained object detection, improving performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: RainFusion2.0 successfully addresses computational cost and hardware generality limitations of existing sparse attention methods, providing an online adaptive, hardware-efficient solution for accelerating both video and image generative models across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Method: Proposes D²VLM framework that decouples learning of temporal grounding and textual response using a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm with evidence tokens. Introduces Factorized Preference Optimization (FPO) algorithm that explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into optimization. Also constructs synthetic dataset for factorized preference learning.

Result: Experiments on various tasks demonstrate clear advantages of the approach over existing methods.

Conclusion: Factorized learning of temporal grounding and textual response with explicit dependency modeling improves video-language understanding, with D²VLM showing superior performance through evidence tokens and FPO algorithm.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

### [97] [Think Before You Move: Latent Motion Reasoning for Text-to-Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24100)
*Yijie Qian,Juncheng Wang,Yuxiang Feng,Chao Xu,Wang Lu,Yang Liu,Baigui Sun,Yiqiang Chen,Yong Liu,Shujun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR), a two-stage "Think-then-Act" approach for Text-to-Motion generation that addresses the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch by separating planning from execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-Motion generation treats it as direct translation, but faces a fundamental bottleneck called Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch - the difficulty of grounding semantically dense language into kinematically dense motion data in a single shot.

Method: Proposes Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) with a Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two manifolds: Reasoning Latent for planning global topology and Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. The model autoregressively reasons (plans) before moving (instantiates frames).

Result: LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility when implemented on two representative baselines (T2M-GPT and MotionStreamer), validating that motion-aligned concept space is better than natural language for motion planning.

Conclusion: The optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language but a learned, motion-aligned concept space. The architectural shift to Latent System 2 Reasoning effectively bridges the gap between language and physics in motion generation.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

*Yongtao Chen,Yanbo Wang,Wentao Zhao,Guole Shen,Tianchen Deng,Jingchuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free generative adversarial attack framework using diffusion models to create naturalistic adversarial objects that fool monocular depth estimation systems in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for autonomous driving but vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing physical attacks use texture-based patches with strict placement constraints and limited realism, reducing effectiveness in complex driving environments.

Method: Training-free generative adversarial attack framework with diffusion-based conditional generation. Includes: 1) Salient Region Selection module to identify MDE-influential regions, and 2) Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism to steer adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by pre-trained diffusion model.

Result: Generates physically plausible adversarial objects that induce substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments show the method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment by creating more realistic and effective adversarial attacks than existing methods.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

TL;DR: GeoBench is a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating geometric reasoning in vision-language models, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks through four reasoning levels and six formally verified tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in VLMs have limitations: risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity.

Method: Developed GeoBench with four hierarchical reasoning levels (Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, Self-Reflective Backtracking) and six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen to systematically assess capabilities from attribute extraction to logical error correction.

Result: Reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, but performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final accuracy, while Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks.

Conclusion: GeoBench establishes a comprehensive benchmark for geometric problem-solving and offers actionable guidelines for developing geometric reasoning systems, highlighting the importance of hierarchical evaluation and specific reasoning components.

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated neural architecture design is challenging due to task diversity and computational constraints. LLMs offer a promising alternative to computationally intensive NAS, but their application to computer vision architecture generation lacks systematic study of prompt engineering and validation strategies.

Method: 1) Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP) - systematic study of supporting examples (n=1-6) for LLM-based architecture generation; 2) Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation - lightweight deduplication method for preventing redundant training; 3) Dataset-balanced evaluation methodology for comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks.

Result: Found n=3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Deduplication method provides 100x speedup over AST parsing. Generated 1,900 unique architectures across 7 computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365).

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establishes rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D²-Align framework prevents Preference Mode Collapse in RLHF-aligned diffusion models by directionally correcting reward signals to maintain diversity while achieving human preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLHF methods for text-to-image diffusion models suffer from Preference Mode Collapse (PMC) - a form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (monolithic styles, overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity despite high automated reward scores.

Method: Proposes Directional Decoupling Alignment (D²-Align): 1) Learns a directional correction within the frozen reward model's embedding space, 2) Applies this correction to reward signals during optimization to prevent mode collapse while maintaining alignment.

Result: D²-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference while maintaining diversity, as shown through comprehensive evaluation combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity.

Conclusion: The proposed D²-Align framework effectively mitigates Preference Mode Collapse in RLHF-aligned diffusion models by directionally correcting reward biases, enabling both high-quality and diverse image generation aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Motivation: There's a need for large-scale multimodal datasets and foundation models specifically designed for industrial defect detection and quality inspection, which can enable more efficient and scalable manufacturing intelligence.

Method: Created IMDD-1M dataset with 1M aligned image-text pairs of real-world defects, then trained a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch on this dataset, enabling lightweight fine-tuning for specialized domains.

Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

TL;DR: Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD) improves neural network performance by using Bayesian inference to create sample-specific target distributions from model predictions, eliminating reliance on hard targets after initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard targets in supervised training cause overconfidence, poor calibration, limited generalization, and reduced robustness. Existing self-distillation methods still depend on hard targets, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: BSD constructs sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions, completely eliminating reliance on hard targets after the initial training phase.

Result: BSD achieves higher test accuracy (+1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100), significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100), improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise, and state-of-the-art robustness under label noise when combined with contrastive loss.

Conclusion: BSD provides a principled Bayesian approach to self-distillation that consistently outperforms existing methods across various architectures and datasets, offering better calibration, accuracy, and robustness without relying on hard targets.

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are too text-centric, leading to poor performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks that require strong logical consistency and spatial precision.

Method: DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task using a diffusion-based framework, enabling direct visual reasoning without text-centric bottlenecks.

Result: DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading models: +314.2% over GPT-5, +111.6% over Gemini-3-Flash, and +39.0% over fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, spatial configuration).

Conclusion: Generative multimodal reasoning via diffusion models represents a promising paradigm shift for vision-centric reasoning, offering superior efficiency, controllability, parallelism, and collaboration compared to text-centric MLLMs.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Global Clustering (DGC) is a memory-efficient framework for hyperspectral image segmentation that learns global clustering from local patches without pre-training, enabling fast training on consumer hardware but suffering from optimization instability due to loss balancing issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral imaging analysis faces computational bottlenecks from massive data volumes exceeding memory. Foundation models pre-trained on remote sensing datasets often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally.

Method: DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, learning global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. It maintains constant memory usage and enables training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware.

Result: On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation with mean IoU 0.925 and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability due to cluster over-merging in feature space from multi-objective loss balancing issues.

Conclusion: The design philosophy has merit as intellectual scaffolding, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing. The work presents a promising conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that needs further refinement for optimization stability.

TL;DR: Internal Guidance (IG) improves diffusion models by adding auxiliary supervision during training and extrapolating intermediate layers during sampling, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores without extra training or complex degradation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models struggle with low-probability areas due to insufficient training data coverage, while existing guidance methods like CFG cause oversimplified/distorted samples or require complex degradation strategies, extra training, and additional sampling steps.

Method: Proposes Internal Guidance (IG) which adds auxiliary supervision on intermediate layers during training, then extrapolates outputs from intermediate and deep layers during sampling to guide generation toward high-probability areas.

Result: Significant improvements in training efficiency and generation quality across baselines. SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 (80 epochs) and 1.75 (800 epochs) on ImageNet 256x256. LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34, and combined with CFG reaches state-of-the-art FID=1.19.

Conclusion: IG is a simple yet effective strategy that outperforms existing guidance methods, achieving state-of-the-art results without requiring complex degradation strategies, extra training, or additional sampling steps.

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

*Pieter M. Blok,Haozhou Wang,Hyun Kwon Suh,Peicheng Wang,James Burridge,Wei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointRAFT is a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts potato tuber weight from partial 3D point clouds captured on harvesters, overcoming occlusion issues without full 3D reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current potato yield estimation using RGB-D cameras on harvesters suffers from systematic underestimation due to self-occlusion in point clouds, requiring a solution that can accurately predict tuber weight from incomplete 3D data.

Method: PointRAFT uses a novel object height embedding to incorporate tuber height as additional geometric information, enabling direct prediction of continuous 3D shape properties from partial point clouds without reconstructing full 3D geometry.

Result: On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved MAE of 12.0g and RMSE of 17.2g, outperforming baseline methods while processing 150 tubers per second (6.3ms per point cloud).

Conclusion: PointRAFT provides an accurate, high-throughput solution for potato yield estimation that meets commercial harvester requirements and has broader applications in 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks.

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CorGi is a training-free inference acceleration framework for Diffusion Transformers that reduces redundant computation by caching and reusing low-contribution transformer blocks across denoising steps, achieving up to 2.0x speedup while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have high inference costs due to their iterative denoising process combined with large model capacity, and recent research shows substantial redundant computation exists across denoising steps that can be optimized.

Method: CorGi uses contribution-guided block-wise interval caching to selectively reuse outputs of transformer blocks across denoising steps. It identifies low-contribution blocks, caches them, and reuses them in later steps within intervals. CorGi+ extends this for text-to-image tasks by using per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and apply partial attention updates to protect important object details.

Result: Evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average while preserving high generation quality.

Conclusion: CorGi provides an effective training-free approach to accelerate DiT inference by reducing redundant computation through selective block caching and reuse, with CorGi+ offering enhanced performance for text-to-image generation tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

Motivation: Addresses the critical challenge of imbalanced medical image data, especially during pandemics like COVID-19, where data scarcity and class imbalance hinder accurate AI-based disease detection.

Method: Uses a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data, combines synthetic and real data with a weighted approach, and employs multi-objective meta-heuristic optimization to tune classifier hyper-parameters.

Result: Achieves 95.5% accuracy for 4-class and 98.5% accuracy for 2-class imbalanced COVID-19 chest X-ray classification, outperforming existing methods with superior cross-validated metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed model effectively handles imbalanced medical image classification during pandemics, demonstrating the value of synthetic data generation and optimization techniques for improving diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

### [110] [ARM: A Learnable, Plug-and-Play Module for CLIP-based Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24224)
*Ziquan Liu,Zhewei Zhu,Xuyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARM is a lightweight learnable module that refines CLIP's internal features for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, trained once on COCO-Stuff and used as a plug-and-play post-processor across various training-free frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's image-level representations lack pixel-level details needed for semantic segmentation. Existing training-free methods either use expensive external models or suboptimal static heuristics, creating a need for efficient refinement of CLIP's internal features.

Method: ARM uses a semantically-guided cross-attention block that fuses hierarchical features: deep features (K, V) select and refine shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. It follows a "train once, use anywhere" paradigm where it's trained on COCO-Stuff once and then used as a universal post-processor.

Result: ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: ARM provides a lightweight, learnable solution that effectively unlocks CLIP's internal potential for semantic segmentation without the computational expense of external models or the limitations of static heuristics.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

### [111] [Mirage: One-Step Video Diffusion for Photorealistic and Coherent Asset Editing in Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24227)
*Shuyun Wang,Haiyang Sun,Bing Wang,Hangjun Ye,Xin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mirage is a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and temporally coherent asset editing in driving scenes, using a text-to-video diffusion prior with 2D encoder injection and two-stage data alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems need diverse training data, but existing video object editing methods struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence for effective data augmentation.

Method: Builds on text-to-video diffusion prior for temporal consistency. Addresses spatial fidelity degradation in 3D causal VAEs by injecting temporally agnostic latents from pretrained 2D encoder into 3D decoder. Solves distribution mismatch between scene objects and inserted assets with two-stage data alignment combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement.

Result: Extensive experiments show Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Conclusion: Mirage provides an effective solution for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes, addressing key challenges in visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and asset alignment for autonomous driving data augmentation.

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotivNet is a generalizable facial emotion recognition model that uses Meta's Sapiens vision foundation model as backbone to achieve cross-dataset performance without cross-domain training, addressing generalization issues in real-world FER applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FER models have weak generalization across diverse datasets, leading to deteriorated real-world performance. Existing solutions require cross-domain training which is contradictory for practical applications. There's a need for models that generalize well without such training.

Method: Uses Meta's Sapiens (human vision foundational model with Masked Autoencoder pretraining) as backbone. MotivNet is proposed as an additional downstream task for Sapiens. Three evaluation criteria are defined: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity.

Result: MotivNet achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training. It meets all three evaluation criteria, validating it as a viable Sapiens downstream task. The model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across domains.

Conclusion: MotivNet successfully addresses FER generalization issues by leveraging Sapiens' vision foundation model, making facial emotion recognition more viable for real-world applications without requiring cross-domain training.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaSeg: A dual-branch semantic segmentation framework using parallel Mamba encoders for RGB and event data fusion with spatial-temporal interaction modules for improved cross-modal alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based segmentation degrades under challenging conditions (fast motion, low-light, HDR) due to frame camera limitations. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but lack color/texture. Existing multimodal fusion approaches are computationally expensive and neglect temporal dynamics in event streams.

Method: Proposes MambaSeg with parallel Mamba encoders for RGB images and event streams. Introduces Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM) with Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM) for fine-grained spatial-temporal fusion to reduce cross-modal ambiguity.

Result: Extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC datasets show state-of-the-art segmentation performance with significantly reduced computational cost compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: MambaSeg demonstrates promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception by effectively leveraging complementary properties of RGB and event modalities through spatial-temporal fusion.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGMP framework for dental CBCT metal artifact reduction uses physics-based simulation for training data and deterministic manifold projection for fast, single-pass inference, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for metal artifact reduction in dental CBCT have limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring (regression-to-the-mean), unsupervised methods risk structural hallucinations, and diffusion models are too slow for clinical use due to iterative sampling.

Method: Three components: 1) Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins; 2) DMP-Former adapts Direct x-Prediction paradigm for deterministic manifold projection in single forward pass; 3) Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module uses medical foundation model priors (MedDINOv3) to ensure clinical plausibility.

Result: PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets, particularly on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

Conclusion: The proposed PGMP framework effectively addresses limitations of existing MAR methods by combining physics-based simulation for training data, deterministic manifold projection for fast inference, and medical foundation model priors for clinical plausibility, making it suitable for clinical applications.

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

*Zhe Huang,Hao Wen,Aiming Hao,Bingze Song,Meiqi Wu,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu,Sheng Lu,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualityForge framework synthesizes counterfactual video QA pairs using diffusion-based editing to reduce MLLM hallucinations, achieving 24% improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs suffer from visual ungrounded hallucinations due to over-reliance on language priors, especially with counterfactual videos. The high cost of collecting counterfactual data makes this problem challenging to address.

Method: DualityForge uses controllable diffusion-based video editing to transform real videos into counterfactual scenarios, generating QA pairs automatically. Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train) employs two-stage SFT-RL with pair-wise ℓ₁ advantage normalization for stable optimization.

Result: 24.0% relative improvement over Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline on counterfactual videos. Significant gains on both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization.

Conclusion: The framework effectively reduces MLLM hallucinations through synthetic counterfactual data and contrastive training, with promising generalization capabilities. Dataset and code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

*Yuan Jia,Ruimin Wu,Rui Song,Jiaojiao Li,Bin Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D panoramic stitching framework that lifts images to 3D point clouds for global fusion, then projects to cylindrical panorama, reducing distortions in complex scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 2D homography and mesh warping methods fail in 3D scenes with multiple depth layers and occlusions, causing ghosting, bending, and stretching distortions, especially in multi-view and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios.

Method: 1) Lift each input image to dense 3D point representation in unified coordinate system with global cross-view fusion using confidence metrics; 2) Establish unified 3D projection center and use equidistant cylindrical projection to map fused data to panoramic manifold; 3) Perform hole filling in canvas domain to address unknown regions from viewpoint transitions.

Result: The method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios with significant parallax and complex occlusions, producing more natural and consistent panoramic results.

Conclusion: The framework successfully re-conceptualizes stitching from 2D warping to 3D consistency paradigm, offering flexibility to incorporate various 3D lifting and completion modules for improved panoramic quality in complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, limiting data for AI model development and training of novice clinicians.

Method: A one-shot, retraining-free generative framework using language-guided concept disentanglement to separate pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter for diversity.

Result: Validated across four rare pathologies; synthetic images were clinically plausible, enhanced AI classifiers (improved true positive rate at low false-positive rates), and in a blinded reader study, novice endoscopists achieved 0.400 increase in recall and 0.267 increase in precision.

Conclusion: EndoRare establishes a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Virtual-Eyes CT preprocessing pipeline improves generalist foundation models but harms specialist models for lung cancer screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT lung cancer screening, and there's a need to understand how preprocessing affects different types of models.

Method: Developed Virtual-Eyes, a 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline that enforces 512x512 resolution, rejects non-diagnostic series, extracts contiguous lung blocks using Hounsfield-unit filtering and lung-coverage scoring. Evaluated on 765 NLST patients using RAD-DINO, Merlin, Sybil, and ResNet-18 models with frozen encoders and leakage-free MLP heads.

Result: Virtual-Eyes improved RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with better calibration. However, Sybil and ResNet-18 degraded under Virtual-Eyes, and Merlin showed limited transferability regardless of preprocessing.

Conclusion: Anatomically targeted quality control can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models that have adapted to raw clinical context, suggesting context dependence and shortcut learning in specialist models.

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

Conclusion: UniAct represents a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control, bridging the gap between high-level multimodal perception and whole-body execution.

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck.

TL;DR: CERES is a causal framework that improves egocentric referring video object segmentation by addressing dataset biases and visual confounding factors through dual-modal causal intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Ego-RVOS methods struggle with spurious correlations from dataset biases and visual confounding factors like rapid motion and occlusions in egocentric videos, limiting robust segmentation performance.

Method: CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: backdoor adjustment to counteract language representation biases from dataset statistics, and front-door adjustment to integrate semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles.

Result: CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, demonstrating improved robustness to egocentric distortions.

Conclusion: The framework shows the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs are limited to text-oriented reasoning or isolated tool use, lacking the ability to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning in knowledge-intensive, visually complex scenarios that require coordinated external tools.

Method: SenseNova-MARS framework with reinforcement learning (BN-GSPO algorithm) that dynamically integrates image search, text search, and image crop tools. Introduces HR-MMSearch benchmark for evaluation.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch benchmarks, surpassing proprietary models like Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. The 8B model outperforms larger proprietary models.

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs with effective tool-use capabilities. All code, models, and datasets will be released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

TL;DR: LVLDrive is a framework that enhances Vision-Language Models for autonomous driving by incorporating LiDAR point clouds to improve 3D spatial understanding, addressing limitations of image-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for autonomous driving rely on 2D images, which struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, creating safety and reliability bottlenecks. There's a need to incorporate 3D metric data for trustworthy autonomous systems.

Method: Proposes LVLDrive framework that adds LiDAR point clouds as an extra input modality to VLMs. Uses Gradual Fusion Q-Former to incrementally inject LiDAR features while preserving pre-trained VLM knowledge. Develops spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to teach advanced 3D perception and reasoning.

Result: LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making on driving benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit 3D metric data is necessary for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems. LVLDrive successfully bridges the gap between VLMs and robust 3D spatial understanding for autonomous driving.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

*Liam Frija-Altrac,Matthew Toews*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding convolutional filtering with rectification, drawing analogies to special relativity and quantum mechanics by analyzing kernels as even (potential energy) and odd (kinetic energy) components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical framework linking information processing in convolutional neural networks to fundamental physical principles, specifically the energy-momentum relation from relativistic physics, providing a new perspective on how CNNs process visual information.

Method: Decompose convolutional kernels into orthogonal even and odd components, analyze their effects on image content (even: isotropic diffusion, odd: directional displacement), and examine these properties in the spectral domain using discrete cosine transform (DCT) to identify fundamental modes of information propagation.

Result: Even kernels preserve center of mass (analogous to rest/potential energy), odd kernels displace center of mass (analogous to kinetic energy), with information speed linearly related to odd vs total kernel energy ratio. Small convolutional filters are dominated by low-frequency DCT bases (DC Σ and gradient ∇ components).

Conclusion: The paper establishes the first demonstrated link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation from modern relativistic physics, proposing elementary information mechanics as a new theoretical model for understanding convolutional filtering mechanics.

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dermatological datasets focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting applicability to patient-centered care. Need for datasets that incorporate patient perspectives and clinical assessment frameworks.

Method: Introduces DermaVQA-DAS extension with Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS) - expert-developed framework with 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions in English/Chinese. Provides expert-annotated datasets for closed QA and segmentation, benchmarking state-of-the-art multimodal models with different prompting strategies.

Result: For segmentation: prompt design impacts performance - default prompt best under Mean-of-Max/Mean-of-Mean, augmented prompt (patient query title+content) best under majority-vote microscore (Jaccard: 0.395, Dice: 0.566 with BiomedParse). For QA: strong performance across models (avg accuracies 0.729-0.798), o3 best (0.798), GPT-4.1 close (0.796), Gemini-1.5-Pro competitive (0.783).

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS addresses limitations of existing dermatological datasets by incorporating patient queries and clinical context through DAS framework. Public release of dataset, schema, and protocols aims to accelerate patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling research.

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RedunCut is a dynamic model size selection system for live video analytics that reduces compute costs by 14-62% while maintaining accuracy, using measurement-driven sampling planning and data-driven performance modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Live video analytics faces high inference costs with modern vision models across massive camera fleets. Existing dynamic model size selection (DMSS) methods fail to generalize to diverse workloads like mobile videos and lower accuracy targets due to inefficient sampling and inaccurate accuracy prediction.

Method: RedunCut introduces two key components: 1) A measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling to avoid inefficient sampling, and 2) A lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve per-segment accuracy prediction.

Result: Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos with multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy. The system remains robust to limited historical data and drift.

Conclusion: RedunCut successfully addresses the limitations of prior DMSS systems by optimizing sampling efficiency and improving accuracy prediction, enabling significant compute cost reductions for live video analytics without model retraining or modification.

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

TL;DR: DyStream is a real-time talking head video generation system that uses flow matching and causal encoding to achieve ultra-low latency (<100ms) for realistic dyadic conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chunk-based methods for talking head video generation have high latency due to requiring full non-causal context windows, which prevents the immediate non-verbal feedback needed for realistic listener responses in dyadic conversations.

Method: Proposes DyStream with two key designs: (1) a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module that incorporates short future context (60ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency.

Result: DyStream generates video within 34ms per frame, keeping total system latency under 100ms. Achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality with offline LipSync Confidence score of 8.13 and online score of 7.61 on HDTF dataset.

Conclusion: DyStream enables real-time dyadic talking head video generation with ultra-low latency, outperforming alternative causal strategies and providing the immediate feedback needed for realistic conversational interactions.

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-driven framework for automated assessment of microanastomosis surgical skill using video transformers and motion analysis to provide objective feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surgical proficiency assessment methods are subjective, time-consuming, and require expert supervision, limiting scalability especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Video transformer architecture (TimeSformer) with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention for action recognition, combined with YOLO-based object detection and tracking for motion feature extraction.

Result: Achieved 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation (increased to 93.62% with post-processing) and 76% average classification accuracy in replicating expert assessments across five skill aspects.

Conclusion: The AI system provides objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback for surgical training, enabling more standardized and data-driven evaluation in surgical education.

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

TL;DR: The paper investigates compositionality in Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders using Discrete Wavelet Transform to obtain image primitives and tests how well composed representations reproduce original image representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While transformer model insights have mainly come from language tasks, this work aims to understand the representations learned by Vision Transformers through the lens of compositionality, providing a new perspective on how ViTs structure visual information.

Method: Introduces a framework using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to obtain input-dependent primitives for vision, then tests compositionality by examining how well composed representations can reproduce original image representations in the ViT encoder's latent space.

Result: Primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, showing that ViTs respect compositionality to some extent in their representation structure.

Conclusion: The study offers a new perspective on how Vision Transformers structure information, demonstrating that compositionality principles apply to ViT encoders and that DWT-derived primitives can reveal this compositional structure in visual representations.

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

TL;DR: A learned image compression framework for multispectral solar imagery using graph-based modules to model inter-band relationships and reduce spatial redundancy, achieving better spectral fidelity and reconstruction quality than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery is challenging for space missions due to limited bandwidth, requiring preservation of fine spectral and spatial details while balancing compression rates.

Method: Two complementary modules: (1) Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE) models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; (2) Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C) combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures.

Result: On SDOML dataset across six EUV channels: 20.15% reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Conclusion: The proposed learned compression framework effectively balances compression efficiency with preservation of spectral and spatial details for solar observations, offering improved reconstruction quality and spectral fidelity for space mission applications.

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model for Single Image Super-Resolution that uses lower-level DINOv2 features instead of text features to provide stricter, hallucination-free conditioning suitable for smartphone photography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-2-Image Diffusion models for SISR cause undesirable hallucinations in smartphone photography where LR images have high fidelity and require minimal generation. Text features are too high-level to describe subtle textures, and patch-based inference on smartphone-sized images can't be accurately described by text.

Method: Introduces a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model that uses lower-level DINOv2 features for conditioning instead of text features. These features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches, enabling hallucination-free super-resolution for smartphone photography.

Result: The proposed F2IDiff model addresses the shortcomings of T2IDiff models by providing more precise, hallucination-free super-resolution suitable for high-fidelity smartphone LR images, while maintaining the strong generative priors needed for SISR.

Conclusion: Using lower-level DINOv2 features instead of text features in diffusion foundation models enables better control over generation in SISR, making it suitable for smartphone photography where hallucination-free, high-fidelity super-resolution is required.

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

TL;DR: AI pipeline combines YOLO object detection models with GPT-4 to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays, achieving clinical accuracy but lacking natural writing style.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI systems in medical imaging only output structured predictions, requiring radiologists to manually convert these into narrative reports. There's a need to bridge this gap by automatically generating full diagnostic narratives from AI findings.

Method: Developed a pipeline integrating YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-rays, followed by GPT-4 for report generation. YOLO models produce bounding boxes and class labels, which are fed to the LLM to create descriptive findings and clinical summaries.

Result: Strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports. YOLOv5 vs YOLOv8 comparison showed differences in detection accuracy and inference latency. GPT-4 excelled in clarity (4.88/5) but scored lower for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating clinical accuracy but stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

Conclusion: The pipeline successfully bridges the gap between structured AI predictions and narrative reports, achieving clinical accuracy. However, current systems still lack the natural writing style of human radiologists, suggesting need for further refinement in language generation aspects.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video codecs (H.264, HEVC) are designed for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning latent representations, limiting integration into deep learning pipelines. There's a need for efficient video compression for bandwidth-sensitive scenarios like real-time streaming, mobile analytics, and CDN optimization.

Method: Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) extending VQ-VAE-2 to spatiotemporal setting with two-level hierarchical latent structure using 3D residual convolutions. Lightweight (18.5M parameters) optimized for 64x64 video clips, incorporating perceptual loss from pre-trained VGG16 network.

Result: Trained on UCF101 dataset (2-second clips, 32 frames at 16 FPS): 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM on test set. Outperforms single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM on validation.

Conclusion: The framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization, particularly for edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video generation methods produce good visual quality but struggle to follow physical laws, lack physics reasoning capabilities, and suffer from scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions.

Method: 1) PhyAugPipe pipeline uses vision-language models with chain-of-thought reasoning to create PhyVidGen-135K dataset; 2) PhyGDPO framework with Physics-Guided Rewarding scheme using VLM-based physics rewards; 3) LoRA-Switch Reference for efficient training without memory-heavy reference duplication.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2 benchmarks for physically consistent video generation.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-aware framework successfully addresses physical consistency in video generation through data augmentation and principled preference optimization, with code and models being open-sourced.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VG benchmarks lack scene diversity and fail to reflect real-world complexities like illumination changes and weather variations, which are crucial for evaluating model robustness in safety-critical applications.

Method: Created RGBT-Ground benchmark with aligned RGB-Thermal image pairs, referring expressions, bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations. Proposed RGBT-VGNet, a unified framework supporting uni-modal (RGB/TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) inputs with effective fusion of complementary visual modalities.

Conclusion: RGBT-Ground enables comprehensive evaluation of visual grounding in complex real-world environments, and RGBT-VGNet provides an effective baseline for robust multi-modal grounding, with all resources to be publicly released for future research.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARFT improves CDVQA by targeting decision-ambiguous samples with reinforcement fine-tuning to sharpen decision boundaries between correct answers and strong distractors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CDVQA models often fail due to decision ambiguity rather than clearly wrong predictions, where models assign similar confidence to correct answers and strong distractors. This ambiguity limits model discriminability and robustness.

Method: DARFT: Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) using an SFT-trained reference policy, then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset using multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent gains over supervised fine-tuning baselines, particularly under few-shot settings, demonstrating improved discriminability and robustness.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing decision-ambiguous samples is crucial for improving CDVQA models, and DARFT effectively addresses this challenge without requiring additional supervision.

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

TL;DR: SliceLens is a hypothesis-driven framework using LLMs/VLMs to discover fine-grained error slices in instance-level vision tasks, outperforming existing methods on new benchmark FeSD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slice discovery methods are limited to image classification and struggle with multi-instance tasks (detection, segmentation, pose estimation). Current benchmarks are biased toward classification or specific algorithms, with artificial ground truth that doesn't reflect real model failures. Error slices often involve complex visual relationships that instance-level approaches can't handle.

Method: SliceLens leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning. It's a hypothesis-driven framework that enables reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices across instance-level vision tasks.

Result: SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on the new FeSD benchmark. It identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, validated through model repair experiments.

Conclusion: SliceLens addresses limitations of existing slice discovery methods by enabling fine-grained error analysis for instance-level vision tasks through LLM/VLM-powered hypothesis generation and verification, with demonstrated effectiveness on both existing benchmarks and the new FeSD benchmark.

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

### [140] [Collaborative Low-Rank Adaptation for Pre-Trained Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24603)
*Zheng Liu,Jinchao Zhu,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoRA is a novel collaborative low-rank adaptation method that balances fine-tuning performance and parameter efficiency for vision transformers through base-space sharing and diversity enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA methods either sacrifice performance for parameter efficiency or introduce excessive parameters, failing to balance learning performance and parameter efficiency. The paper aims to address this trade-off problem.

Method: CLoRA consists of two components: 1) Base-space sharing where all low-rank modules share down/up-projection spaces, and 2) Sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) that regularizes similarities among low-rank matrices to encourage diverse representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on image and point cloud datasets show CLoRA achieves better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CLoRA successfully addresses the trade-off between fine-tuning performance and parameter efficiency in vision transformer adaptation, offering an effective collaborative approach with shared spaces and diversity regularization.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding focuses on indoor/outdoor driving scenes, but roadside infrastructure monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to lack of paired point cloud-text data from roadside sensors.

Method: Construct MoniRefer dataset with 136,018 objects and 411,128 language expressions from real traffic intersections, and propose Moni3DVG end-to-end method that fuses image appearance features with point cloud geometry/optical information.

Result: Created first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside 3D visual grounding; extensive experiments show superiority and effectiveness of proposed Moni3DVG method.

Conclusion: Introduces novel 3D visual grounding task for outdoor monitoring scenarios, provides benchmark dataset, and demonstrates effective multi-modal approach for infrastructure-level traffic scene understanding.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

TL;DR: Proposes Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network for robust feature point matching with outlier handling, using stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature point matching is fundamental but suffers from outlier contamination that reduces accuracy and robustness. Need to extract high-quality information while reducing errors from negative samples, especially with large outlier proportions.

Method: Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network with: 1) Layer-by-layer channel fusion module to preserve feature semantic information from each stage, 2) Hierarchical attention module to adaptively capture and fuse global perception and structural semantic information, 3) Two architectures for feature extraction and integration.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets for both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses outlier issues in feature point matching through hierarchical attention mechanisms and stage fusion, improving matching precision and robustness in computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

TL;DR: FRS-YOLO: Improved YOLO model for fire rescue object detection with new FireRescue dataset covering urban/mountain/forest/water scenes and 8 key categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fire detection research has limitations: 1) focuses mainly on mountainous/forest areas, not complex urban rescue scenes; 2) limited classes (flames/smoke only), lacking comprehensive system for command-critical targets like fire trucks and firefighters.

Method: 1) Constructed new FireRescue dataset with 15,980 images, 32,000 bounding boxes covering urban/mountain/forest/water scenes and 8 key categories. 2) Proposed FRS-YOLO model with: a) plug-and-play multidimensional collaborative enhancement attention module for cross-dimensional feature interaction to reduce inter-class confusion; b) dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features against smoke occlusion and background interference.

Result: Experimental results show fire rescue object detection is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves YOLO series models' detection performance in this context.

Conclusion: The paper addresses key gaps in fire rescue object detection by creating a comprehensive dataset and developing an improved YOLO model that handles inter-class confusion and small target detection in chaotic rescue scenarios.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadAR accelerates autoregressive visual generation using radial topology and parallel ring-wise prediction with dynamic output correction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive models for visual generation suffer from low inference efficiency due to sequential token-by-token decoding, despite their success in language modeling.

Method: Organizes generation around radial topology: selects initial token as center, groups tokens into concentric rings by spatial distance, predicts tokens ring-wise from inner to outer regions in parallel. Introduces nested attention mechanism to refine implausible outputs during forward pass.

Result: Significantly improves generation efficiency while preserving representational capacity and structural locality of visual scenes.

Conclusion: RadAR provides an efficient and parallelizable framework for autoregressive visual generation by exploiting spatial correlations and local dependencies through radial topology and dynamic output correction.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor network structure search methods face limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness. They struggle with single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing inefficiency.

Method: RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions, featuring learnable edge gates for topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension (measuring local stress) and edge information flow (quantifying connectivity importance). It starts from low-complexity coarse scales and refines to finer ones.

Result: Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600× faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: RGTN validates the effectiveness of physics-inspired approaches for tensor network structure search, overcoming key challenges of existing methods through multi-scale renormalization group flows and continuous structure evolution.

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVOL-SAM3: A zero-shot reasoning segmentation framework that uses evolutionary search at inference time to iteratively refine prompts through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop, outperforming both static baselines and supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning segmentation methods have significant limitations: SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, RL has training instability and rigid reward functions, and training-free methods are limited by static "generate-then-segment" inference that lacks reasoning depth and self-correction capabilities.

Method: EVOL-SAM3 reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. It maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop with three key components: Visual Arena for reference-free pairwise tournament evaluation, Semantic Mutation operator for diversity injection and error correction, and Heterogeneous Arena integrating geometric priors with semantic reasoning for final selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show EVOL-SAM3 substantially outperforms static baselines and significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Conclusion: EVOL-SAM3 demonstrates that evolutionary search at inference time can effectively address limitations of current reasoning segmentation approaches, achieving superior performance without training while enabling deeper reasoning and self-correction capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

*Wentao Zhang,Tao Fang,Lina Lu,Lifei Wang,Weihe Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPJ is a training-free few-shot framework that uses structured image captions and LLM-as-Judge refinement to improve agricultural pest VQA performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crop disease diagnosis methods require costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts, lacking interpretability for agricultural decision-making.

Method: Caption-Prompt-Judge (CPJ) framework: generates multi-angle captions using vision-language models, refines them via LLM-as-Judge iterative refinement, then uses dual-answer VQA for both disease recognition and management responses.

Result: On CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: +22.7 percentage points in disease classification and +19.5 points in QA score over no-caption baselines using GPT-5-mini captions with GPT-5-Nano.

Conclusion: CPJ provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning for robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without requiring fine-tuning, advancing interpretable crop disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

*Jibin Song,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowBlending is a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that uses large models for capacity-sensitive early/late stages and small models for intermediate stages, achieving faster inference with fewer FLOPs while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses the observation that model capacity impact varies across diffusion timesteps - crucial for early and late stages but negligible during intermediate stages. This insight motivates a more efficient sampling strategy that doesn't require large models throughout the entire process.

Method: FlowBlending uses a large model and a small model together: large model handles capacity-sensitive early and late stages, while small model handles intermediate stages. The method includes criteria for choosing stage boundaries and uses velocity-divergence analysis to identify capacity-sensitive regions.

Result: Achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs while maintaining visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment comparable to large models. Compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

Conclusion: FlowBlending provides an effective strategy for efficient video generation by leveraging the varying importance of model capacity across diffusion timesteps, enabling significant computational savings without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

*Bingxuan Li,Yiming Cui,Yicheng He,Yiwei Wang,Shu Zhang,Longyin Wen,Yulei Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoFoley introduces a new video-grounded sound generation task with fine-grained control, addressing limitations of current VT2A models through symbolic event representation and a large expert-curated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-text-to-audio (VT2A) models have three key limitations: 1) visual-text conditioning imbalance causing visual dominance, 2) lack of concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation, and 3) weak instruction understanding due to brief categorical tags in existing datasets.

Method: Proposes EchoFoley task with symbolic representation for sounding events (when, what, how), EchoFoley-6k benchmark (6,000+ video-instruction-annotation triplets), and EchoVidia framework with sounding-event-centric agentic generation using slow-fast thinking strategy.

Result: EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality, demonstrating significant improvements in fine-grained sound generation control.

Conclusion: The EchoFoley framework successfully addresses limitations of current VT2A models by enabling fine-grained control over sound generation through symbolic event representation and hierarchical semantic control, with substantial improvements in both controllability and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy.

*Ankit Dhiman,Srinath R,Jaswanth Reddy,Lokesh R Boregowda,Venkatesh Babu Radhakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified framework for 3D instance segmentation that integrates feature embedding learning and label decoding into a single process, addressing 2D label inconsistencies and improving performance with boundary-aware hard mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods suffer from inconsistencies in 2D instance labels across different views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Current approaches use two-stage methods that are either hyperparameter-sensitive or require preprocessing, increasing training time and complexity.

Method: Proposes a unified framework with learnable feature embeddings in Gaussian primitives, decoded into instance labels via "Embedding-to-Label" process. Addresses boundary artifacts by applying hard mining to rasterized feature embeddings through a linear layer before calculating triplet loss for stability.

Result: Outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets, with reduced training time and improved segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The unified framework effectively integrates feature learning and label decoding, while boundary-aware hard mining with stabilized training significantly improves 3D instance segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes a projection-based adversarial attack on monocular depth estimation models using physics-in-the-loop optimization to create perturbations that cause depth misestimation and object disappearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and this vulnerability extends to monocular depth estimation models, threatening their reliability in practical applications. There's a critical need to validate and understand these vulnerabilities to enhance robustness.

Method: A projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto target objects. Uses physics-in-the-loop optimization to evaluate candidate solutions in actual environments (accounting for device specs and disturbances) and employs a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy.

Result: The method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, causing parts of objects to disappear from the target scene.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models to physical adversarial attacks and validates the effectiveness of the proposed projection-based attack method with physics-in-the-loop optimization.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

### [153] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to enable Noise2Noise training with certain nonlinear functions applied to noisy targets, overcoming a major limitation where nonlinearities previously caused bias in denoising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise training eliminates the need for clean target images but has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to noisy targets introduce bias. This restricts preprocessing options, especially for challenging cases like HDR image denoising where nonlinear tone mapping is commonly used to handle outliers.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework to analyze nonlinear function effects on Noise2Noise training. Identified a class of nonlinear functions that can be applied to noisy targets with minimal bias. Specifically studied combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions that reduce outlier effects while introducing minimal bias for HDR image denoising.

Result: The method was applied to Monte Carlo rendering HDR image denoising, where Noise2Noise training typically struggles with outliers. Results approach those of the original implementation trained with high-sample count reference images, but using only noisy training data.

Conclusion: Certain nonlinear functions can be safely used with Noise2Noise training without significant bias, expanding its applicability to challenging domains like HDR image denoising where nonlinear preprocessing is essential for handling outliers.

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

*Jason Armitage,Rico Sennnrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method that enables 2D-trained cross-modal systems to adapt online to 3D scenes using regret minimization and derivative-free optimization, controlling an in-scene camera to handle occlusions without pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs face a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes, requiring a control module for in-scene cameras to bridge this gap.

Method: Uses regret minimization with derivative-free optimization to improve multivariate mutual information estimates, enabling control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from noisy vision-language model outputs.

Result: The pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without requiring pretraining or finetuning, allowing adaptation to object occlusions and feature differentiation.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges the 2D-to-3D gap for cross-modal systems through camera control optimization, enabling online adaptation to complex 3D scenes with occlusions.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

*Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid,Jordan A. James,William J. Beksi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropTrack is a novel multiple-object tracking framework for agricultural environments that combines appearance and motion information to address challenges like repetitive patterns, similar appearances, and frequent occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agricultural MOT trackers rely primarily on motion information and struggle with identity preservation during frequent occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes appearance-based association difficult, creating a need for better tracking solutions in agricultural scenarios.

Method: CropTrack integrates three key components: 1) reranking-enhanced appearance association, 2) one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and 3) an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association.

Result: CropTrack outperforms traditional motion-based tracking methods on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, showing consistent identity preservation, significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores, and lower number of identity switches compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The combination of appearance and motion information in CropTrack effectively addresses the unique challenges of agricultural MOT, providing superior tracking performance with better identity preservation in complex agricultural environments.

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs show poor context awareness and spatial reasoning in embodied navigation despite their general vision-language capabilities, revealed through a new evaluation framework VLN-MME.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate MLLMs' potential as embodied agents for vision-language navigation tasks, which require multi-round dialogue, spatial reasoning, and sequential action prediction - capabilities not well explored in current MLLM research.

Method: Introduces VLN-MME, a unified evaluation framework that bridges traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark. Uses modular design for structured comparisons and component-level ablations across MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks.

Result: Counterintuitively, enhancing baseline agents with Chain-of-Thought reasoning and self-reflection leads to performance decrease, revealing MLLMs have poor context awareness and low 3D spatial reasoning fidelity in embodied navigation tasks.

Conclusion: MLLMs exhibit limitations in sequential decision-making for embodied navigation despite following instructions well. VLN-MME provides systematic evaluation groundwork and offers crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OFL-SAM2 is a prompt-free adaptation of SAM2 for medical image segmentation that uses a lightweight mapping network trained with limited annotated data to generate target features, eliminating the need for manual prompts while achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2 shows promise for medical image segmentation but requires extensive annotated data and manual prompts, which are labor-intensive and need medical expert intervention. There's a need for label-efficient adaptation that eliminates the prompt requirement.

Method: Introduces OFL-SAM2 with two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains a lightweight mapping network using limited data to generate target features, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates these target features with SAM2's memory-attention features. The mapping network supports online parameter updates during inference for better generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on three diverse medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Conclusion: OFL-SAM2 successfully adapts SAM2 to medical image segmentation in a prompt-free, label-efficient manner by leveraging limited annotated samples to train a mapping network that captures medical knowledge and provides discriminative target representations, eliminating the need for manual prompts while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

TL;DR: FinMMDocR is a bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on real-world financial numerical reasoning with scenario awareness, complex document understanding, and multi-step computation challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack the complexity of real-world financial reasoning. There's a need for benchmarks that incorporate implicit financial scenarios, complex document structures, and multi-step reasoning to properly evaluate MLLMs on practical financial tasks.

Method: Created a benchmark with 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporating 12 types of implicit financial scenarios. Includes 837 Chinese/English documents across 9 document types averaging 50.8 pages with rich visual elements. Problems require multi-step reasoning averaging 11 steps (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps).

Result: The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy on the benchmark. Different RAG methods show significant performance variations. 65.0% of problems require cross-page evidence (average 2.4 pages).

Conclusion: FinMMDocR exposes significant gaps in current MLLMs' ability to handle complex multimodal financial reasoning. The benchmark is expected to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods for real-world multimodal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: A lidar domain adaptation method using neuron activation patterns that achieves SOTA performance by annotating only a small, diverse subset of target domain samples, preventing weight drift with continual learning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D object detectors for autonomous vehicles struggle with domain generalization (e.g., US-trained models performing poorly in Asia/Europe), creating a need for efficient domain adaptation methods that minimize annotation costs.

Method: Proposes a lidar domain adaptation approach based on neuron activation patterns, selecting a small but representative and diverse subset of target domain samples for annotation, combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning to prevent weight drift.

Result: The method outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques, achieving superior performance with minimal annotation budget.

Conclusion: Effective domain adaptation for 3D object detectors can be achieved with minimal annotation by strategically selecting diverse target samples based on neuron activation patterns and preventing weight drift through continual learning techniques.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful content-understanding ability to help human expert better restore indistinguishable film defects.Specifically, we employ a patch-wise training and testing strategy to make restoring high-resolution films on one 24GB-VRAMR GPU possible and design a position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules.Also, we introduce a global-local frequency module to reconstruct consistent textures among different patches. Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods. Code and the dataset will be released.

*Xinran Gong,Gorkem Durak,Halil Ertugrul Aktas,Vedat Cicek,Jinkui Hao,Ulas Bagci,Nilay S. Shah,Bo Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProDM is a diffusion model that removes motion artifacts from non-gated chest CT scans to improve coronary artery calcium scoring accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAC scoring from non-gated chest CT is limited by motion artifacts, while ECG-gated cardiac CTs are not widely available for population screening due to gating requirements and insurance coverage limitations.

Method: ProDM uses three key components: 1) CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions from cardiac-gated CTs, 2) property-aware learning with calcium-specific priors via differentiable calcium consistency loss, and 3) progressive correction scheme across diffusion steps.

Result: ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared to baselines. Reader study confirms motion artifact suppression and improved clinical usability.

Conclusion: ProDM demonstrates the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging, making CAC assessment more accessible.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIPER benchmark introduces process-aware evaluation for video reasoning models to detect outcome-hacking, with new POC@r metric showing current models achieve only ~20% consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation evaluation frameworks rely on single-frame assessments, leading to outcome-hacking where models reach correct conclusions through erroneous processes, failing to capture true reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposed VIPER benchmark with 16 tasks across multiple reasoning domains, and introduced Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r) metric using VLM-as-Judge with hierarchical rubric to evaluate both intermediate steps and final results.

Result: State-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0, showing significant outcome-hacking. Test-time scaling and sampling robustness analysis reveals substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning.

Conclusion: Process-aware evaluation is crucial for assessing true reasoning capabilities in video generation models, revealing current limitations and the need for benchmarks like VIPER to advance Generative Video Reasoning.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

*Siyuan Hu,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShowUI-π is a flow-based generative model for GUI agents that enables both discrete clicks and continuous drag actions, addressing limitations of existing GUI agents that can't handle closed-loop trajectories like dragging progress bars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y coordinates), which prevents them from performing free-form, closed-loop trajectories like dragging progress bars that require continuous perception and adjustment. This limits their ability to achieve human-like dexterous manipulation in digital environments.

Method: 1) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions model integrating both click and drag actions; 2) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling that predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations; 3) Collection of 20K drag trajectories across five domains (PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro, etc.) and creation of ScreenDrag benchmark with online/offline evaluation protocols.

Result: ShowUI-π achieves 26.98 score on ScreenDrag benchmark with only 450M parameters, outperforming proprietary GUI agents (Operator: 13.27, Gemini-2.5-CUA: 22.18). The benchmark reveals current GUI agents struggle with drag tasks.

Conclusion: ShowUI-π advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control by enabling continuous drag actions through flow-based generative modeling, with the ScreenDrag benchmark providing a comprehensive evaluation framework for future research.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

TL;DR: Compression techniques (quantization, pruning, clustering) can preserve or even improve model robustness against natural corruption, with customized combinations yielding optimal trade-offs between accuracy, robustness, and compression ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model compression is essential for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices, but it may affect model robustness under natural corruption.

*Yohan Park,Hyunwoo Ha,Wonjun Jo,Tae-Hyun Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DarkEQA is a benchmark for evaluating Vision Language Models' perceptual capabilities under realistic low-light conditions, revealing significant performance limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM benchmarks focus on ideal lighting conditions, but real-world embodied agents need to operate 24/7 including in dark environments. There's a critical gap in evaluating VLMs' robustness to visual degradations like low-light conditions.

Method: Created DarkEQA benchmark with physics-based low-light simulation in linear RAW space, modeling illumination drop and sensor noise followed by ISP-inspired rendering. Evaluates question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations to isolate perception bottlenecks.

Result: Systematic evaluation reveals significant limitations of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement models when operating under challenging low-light conditions.

Conclusion: DarkEQA addresses a critical oversight in VLM evaluation and enables attributable robustness analysis for embodied AI systems that must operate in real-world lighting variations.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

### [166] [Bi-C2R: Bidirectional Continual Compatible Representation for Re-indexing Free Lifelong Person Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25000)
*Zhenyu Cui,Jiahuan Zhou,Yuxin Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new lifelong person Re-ID task (RFL-ReID) that eliminates the need for re-indexing historical gallery images, with a proposed Bi-C2R framework for continuous compatible feature updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lifelong Re-ID methods require costly re-indexing of historical gallery images after each model update, which raises privacy concerns and computational burdens. There's a need for a solution that maintains feature compatibility between old and new models without re-indexing.

Method: Proposes a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework that continuously updates gallery features extracted by old models to maintain compatibility with query features from updated models, enabling lifelong Re-ID without re-indexing.

Result: The Bi-C2R method achieves leading performance on both the new RFL-ReID task and traditional L-ReID task across multiple benchmarks, validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments.

Conclusion: RFL-ReID is a more challenging but practical lifelong Re-ID task that eliminates re-indexing requirements, and the proposed Bi-C2R framework effectively addresses feature compatibility issues while maintaining strong performance.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

TL;DR: FoundationSLAM is a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that integrates flow estimation with geometric reasoning using foundation depth models, achieving accurate tracking and mapping with real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous flow-based SLAM approaches lack geometric consistency, which limits their accuracy and robustness in tracking and mapping tasks. The authors aim to bridge this gap by combining flow estimation with geometric reasoning.

Method: 1) Hybrid Flow Network for geometry-aware correspondences; 2) Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer for joint optimization of pose and depth; 3) Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that adapts flow updates based on region reliability.

Result: Superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, real-time performance at 18 FPS, and strong generalization to various scenarios.

Conclusion: FoundationSLAM successfully addresses geometric consistency issues in flow-based SLAM, demonstrating practical applicability through accurate, robust, and real-time monocular dense SLAM with good generalization capabilities.

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

### [168] [From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25066)
*Xu He,Haoxian Zhang,Hejia Chen,Changyuan Zheng,Liyang Chen,Songlin Tang,Jiehui Huang,Xiaoqiang Liu,Pengfei Wan,Zhiyong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-bootstrapping framework transforms visual dubbing from ill-posed inpainting to well-conditioned video editing using Diffusion Transformers to generate ideal training data and achieve precise lip synchronization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio-driven visual dubbing lacks ideal training data where only lip movements differ while all other visual conditions remain identical. Existing mask-based inpainting methods force models to hallucinate missing content while syncing lips, causing visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization.

Method: Proposes a self-bootstrapping framework using Diffusion Transformers: 1) DiT as data generator synthesizes ideal training data (lip-altered companion videos for real samples), 2) DiT-based audio-driven editor trained end-to-end on aligned video pairs, 3) Timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, 4) ContextDubBench benchmark dataset for robust evaluation.

Result: Achieves highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness in challenging in-the-wild scenarios. The complete frame-aligned input conditioning provides rich visual context for precise audio-driven lip modifications.

Conclusion: Reframing visual dubbing from ill-posed inpainting to well-conditioned video-to-video editing with a self-bootstrapping framework enables superior performance in lip synchronization, identity preservation, and robustness across diverse practical scenarios.

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

*Dian Shao,Mingfei Shi,Like Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineTec is a unified framework for fine-grained action recognition from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences that uses context-aware completion, spatial decomposition, physics-driven acceleration estimation, and GCN-based recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with fine-grained action recognition from corrupted skeleton sequences, failing to recover temporal dynamics and spatial structures, which leads to loss of subtle motion cues needed to distinguish similar actions.

Method: 1) Context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking to restore base skeleton sequence; 2) Spatial decomposition into 5 semantic regions divided into dynamic/static subgroups with targeted perturbation; 3) Physics-driven estimation using Lagrangian dynamics to compute joint accelerations; 4) GCN-based recognition head processing both fused skeleton positions and accelerations.

Result: Significantly outperforms previous methods on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks under various corruption levels. Achieves 89.1% and 78.1% top-1 accuracy on Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings.

Conclusion: FineTec effectively addresses fine-grained action recognition from corrupted skeleton sequences by combining temporal restoration, spatial decomposition, physics-based acceleration estimation, and graph-based learning, demonstrating robustness and generalizability.

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edit3r is a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images, eliminating the need for per-scene optimization or pose estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior 3D editing methods require per-scene optimization, which is slow and computationally expensive. There's a need for fast, feed-forward 3D editing that can handle unposed, view-inconsistent images while maintaining 3D consistency and semantic alignment.

Method: Edit3r uses: (1) SAM2-based recoloring strategy to generate cross-view-consistent supervision data, (2) asymmetric input strategy pairing recolored reference views with raw auxiliary views to encourage fusion and alignment of disparate observations, and (3) direct prediction of instruction-aligned 3D edits without optimization.

Result: Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, operates at significantly higher inference speed, and can handle images edited by 2D methods like InstructPix2Pix despite not being trained on them. The paper also introduces DL3DV-Edit-Bench benchmark for evaluation.

Conclusion: Edit3r enables fast, photorealistic 3D editing without optimization or pose estimation, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications by effectively handling view-inconsistent edited images through novel training strategies.

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

*Yi-Chuan Huang,Hao-Jen Chien,Chin-Yang Lin,Ying-Huan Chen,Yu-Lun Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaMO is a geometry-aware multi-view outpainting framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction that expands field of view from existing poses instead of generating new viewpoints, achieving state-of-the-art quality with 25× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sparse-view 3D reconstruction methods have limitations: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. Diffusion-based methods generate novel views but suffer from these issues.

Method: GaMO reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, it expands the field of view from existing camera poses, using multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training.

Result: Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ show state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving 25× speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Conclusion: GaMO provides an effective solution for sparse-view 3D reconstruction by preserving geometric consistency through multi-view outpainting, achieving superior quality and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpaceTimePilot is a video diffusion model that independently controls camera viewpoint and motion sequence for continuous space-time exploration from monocular videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack explicit disentangled control over both spatial (camera viewpoint) and temporal (motion sequence) dimensions, limiting creative exploration of dynamic scenes.

Method: Introduces animation time-embedding for explicit motion control, temporal-warping training using multi-view datasets to simulate temporal variations, improved camera-conditioning, and CamxTime synthetic dataset for full space-time coverage.

Result: Demonstrates clear space-time disentanglement on real-world and synthetic data, achieving strong results compared to prior work with precise independent control over viewpoint and motion.

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot successfully achieves robust space-time disentanglement for controllable generative rendering, enabling continuous exploration of dynamic scenes across both spatial and temporal dimensions.

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Main category: physics.med-ph

TL;DR: A diffusion model-based method called q3-MuPa combines deep generative modeling with physics-based constraints to produce high-quality quantitative MRI maps from accelerated, silent MuPa-ZTE scans in about 1 minute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve quantitative MRI mapping performance while enabling faster acquisition times (4x acceleration) and maintaining the patient comfort benefits of silent MuPa-ZTE scanning.

Method: Trained a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) on synthetic data from digital brain phantoms to map MuPa-ZTE image series to qMRI maps, incorporating the MuPa-ZTE forward signal model as explicit data consistency constraint during inference.

Result: The method produces 3D qMRI maps with high accuracy, reduced noise, and better preservation of structural details compared to baseline dictionary matching and purely data-driven diffusion models, and generalizes well to real scans despite synthetic-only training.

Conclusion: The q3-MuPa framework combining MuPa-ZTE acquisition with physics-informed diffusion modeling shows strong clinical potential as a quick, quiet, and quantitative multi-parametric mapping solution.

Abstract: The 3D fast silent multi-parametric mapping sequence with zero echo time (MuPa-ZTE) is a novel quantitative MRI (qMRI) acquisition that enables nearly silent scanning by using a 3D phyllotaxis sampling scheme. MuPa-ZTE improves patient comfort and motion robustness, and generates quantitative maps of T1, T2, and proton density using the acquired weighted image series. In this work, we propose a diffusion model-based qMRI mapping method that leverages both a deep generative model and physics-based data consistency to further improve the mapping performance. Furthermore, our method enables additional acquisition acceleration, allowing high-quality qMRI mapping from a fourfold-accelerated MuPa-ZTE scan (approximately 1 minute). Specifically, we trained a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to map MuPa-ZTE image series to qMRI maps, and we incorporated the MuPa-ZTE forward signal model as an explicit data consistency (DC) constraint during inference. We compared our mapping method against a baseline dictionary matching approach and a purely data-driven diffusion model. The diffusion models were trained entirely on synthetic data generated from digital brain phantoms, eliminating the need for large real-scan datasets. We evaluated on synthetic data, a NISM/ISMRM phantom, healthy volunteers, and a patient with brain metastases. The results demonstrated that our method produces 3D qMRI maps with high accuracy, reduced noise and better preservation of structural details. Notably, it generalised well to real scans despite training on synthetic data alone. The combination of the MuPa-ZTE acquisition and our physics-informed diffusion model is termed q3-MuPa, a quick, quiet, and quantitative multi-parametric mapping framework, and our findings highlight its strong clinical potential.

### [174] [Large language models and the entropy of English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24969)
*Colin Scheibner,Lindsay M. Smith,William Bialek*

Main category: cond-mat.stat-mech

TL;DR: LLMs reveal long-range dependencies in English text up to ~10^4 characters, showing correlations persist over large distances and are learned gradually during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the presence and nature of long-range structure in English texts using large language models, and understand how these dependencies constrain statistical physics models of language.

Method: Analyze conditional entropy/code length across varying context lengths up to N~10^4 characters using LLMs, examine correlations between distant characters, and study code length distribution and training dynamics.

Result: Code length continues decreasing with context length up to large distances, revealing direct dependencies across ~10^4 characters. Significant correlations exist between distant characters, and LLMs show emergent certainty about characters at large N. Long-range structure is learned gradually during training.

Conclusion: English text contains long-range dependencies extending to thousands of characters, constraining statistical physics models of both LLMs and language itself, with implications for understanding language structure and model training dynamics.

Abstract: We use large language models (LLMs) to uncover long-ranged structure in English texts from a variety of sources. The conditional entropy or code length in many cases continues to decrease with context length at least to $N\sim 10^4$ characters, implying that there are direct dependencies or interactions across these distances. A corollary is that there are small but significant correlations between characters at these separations, as we show from the data independent of models. The distribution of code lengths reveals an emergent certainty about an increasing fraction of characters at large $N$. Over the course of model training, we observe different dynamics at long and short context lengths, suggesting that long-ranged structure is learned only gradually. Our results constrain efforts to build statistical physics models of LLMs or language itself.

*Pawan Adhikari,Satish Raj Regmi,Hari Ram Shrestha*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Automated deep learning pipeline using Sentinel-1 SAR time-series for targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes, achieving high accuracy with a "temporal-first" training strategy and operational Dockerized architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GLOF monitoring approaches have limitations: generalistic models prioritize spatial coverage over targeted monitoring, and optical imagery suffers from cloud coverage issues. There's a need for automated, targeted monitoring systems for high-risk glacial lakes to enable early warning systems.

Method: End-to-end automated deep learning pipeline using Sentinel-1 SAR time-series data. Uses U-Net with EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained with "temporal-first" strategy on curated dataset of 4 Himalayan lakes. Includes Dockerized operational architecture with automated data ingestion via ASF Search API and RESTful endpoint for inference results.

Result: Model achieves IoU of 0.9130, validating the success of the "temporal-first" training strategy. The operational pipeline enables automated monitoring and shifts from static mapping to dynamic early warning systems.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides a scalable foundation for transitioning to operational Early Warning Systems for GLOFs, addressing limitations of existing approaches through targeted monitoring, SAR-based cloud-penetrating capabilities, and automated operational architecture.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are one of the most devastating climate change induced hazards. Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a "temporal-first" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the "temporal-first" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.

*Youssef Megahed,Aylin Erman,Robin Ducharme,Mark C. Walker,Steven Hawken,Adrian D. C. Chan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Self-supervised ultrasound foundation model (USF-MAE) outperforms supervised baselines for first-trimester fetal heart view classification, achieving 90.57% accuracy without aggressive preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Congenital heart disease is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity/mortality. Early detection via first-trimester fetal echocardiography is challenging due to small structures, low SNR, and operator variability. Automated analysis at this stage needs improvement.

Method: USF-MAE (masked autoencoder) pretrained on 370K+ unlabeled ultrasound images across 40+ anatomical regions, then fine-tuned on 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify 5 categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Compared against ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ImageNet-pretrained ViT-B/16 baselines.

Result: USF-MAE achieved best performance: 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, 90.71% F1-score. Outperformed strongest baseline (ResNet-18) by +2.03% accuracy and +1.98% F1-score. Showed robust performance without aggressive preprocessing and better discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ultrasound foundation models pretrained on diverse unlabeled ultrasound data can effectively transfer to challenging first-trimester fetal heart classification tasks, outperforming supervised models and natural image-pretrained transformers.

Abstract: Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

TL;DR: Autonomous stabilization method for quantum-dot qubits using charge stability diagrams to track electrostatic drift, maintain stable operations, and perform noise spectroscopy in large arrays.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semiconductor quantum-dot qubits suffer from electrostatic drift and charge noise that destabilize qubit parameters, making manual recalibration impractical for large-scale arrays, necessitating autonomous stabilization frameworks.

Method: Uses charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. Tracks motion of selected transitions to detect voltage drifts, identify charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates.

Result: Demonstrated on a 10-QD device with robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise. Enabled time-domain noise spectroscopy revealing: background noise at 100 μHz dominated by drift with 1/f² power law, few dominant two-level fluctuators, and average linear correlation length of (188 ± 38) nm.

Conclusion: The method forms the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.

Abstract: The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$μ$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.

*Luca Collorone,Mert Kiray,Indro Spinelli,Fabio Galasso,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PhysTalk enables real-time, physics-based 4D animation of 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes from text prompts using LLM-generated code, eliminating mesh extraction and offline optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual effects generation pipelines lack physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. There's a need for interactive, physics-based animation that can respond to arbitrary text prompts in real time.

Method: Takes 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scenes as input, uses a large language model to generate executable code that modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics, directly coupling 3DGS with physics simulation without mesh extraction.

Result: Enables real-time, interactive 4D animations with collision-aware, physics-based manipulation of arbitrary multi-material objects, remaining open-vocabulary while being train-free and computationally lightweight.

Conclusion: PhysTalk shifts visual effects workflows from "render and wait" to interactive dialogue, making 4D animation broadly accessible through a modern, physics-informed pipeline that doesn't require time-consuming optimization.

Abstract: Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a "render and wait" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.

### [180] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces DDFT (Drill-Down and Fabricate Test) to measure epistemic robustness - how well language models maintain factual accuracy under semantic compression and adversarial attacks, finding that robustness is orthogonal to model size/architecture and depends on error detection capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current language model evaluations (like MMLU, TruthfulQA) only measure knowledge under ideal conditions, not how robustly models maintain factual accuracy when information degrades or under adversarial probing. There's a need to distinguish models that truly know facts from those whose verification mechanisms fail under stress.

Method: Introduces DDFT protocol with two-system cognitive model: Semantic System (generates text) and Epistemic Verifier (validates facts). Evaluates 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations). Measures robustness under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication.

Result: Epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design: neither parameter count (r=0.083) nor architecture type (r=0.153) predicts robustness. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817). Flagship models show brittleness despite scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance.

Conclusion: Robustness emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. DDFT provides theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications, challenging assumptions about model size-reliability relationship.

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage approach for spatial reasoning in LLMs: first fine-tune on basic spatial transformations, then train lightweight adapters for multi-step planning in puzzle environments, outperforming baselines with faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments, limiting applications in navigation and planning tasks.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations (rotation, translation, scaling) to equip model with basic spatial physics; 2) Freeze physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within GRPO framework to learn policies for composing building blocks in multi-step planning, using synthesized ASCII-art dataset and ASCII-based RL environment.

Result: Method consistently outperforms baselines (generic backbone, physics-aware model, end-to-end RL models) in both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments requiring internal state tracking. Approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training than end-to-end RL from scratch.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition of spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition effectively enhances LLM spatial capabilities, with attention pattern analysis confirming meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

TL;DR: RLMs enable LLMs to process arbitrarily long prompts via recursive self-calling, handling inputs 100x beyond context windows with better quality and comparable cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limited context windows that restrict their ability to process arbitrarily long prompts, creating a need for inference-time scaling solutions.

Method: Recursive Language Models (RLMs) - an inference strategy where LLMs treat long prompts as external environments and programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call themselves over prompt snippets.

Result: RLMs successfully handle inputs up to 100x beyond model context windows, dramatically outperform base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, with comparable or cheaper cost per query.

Conclusion: RLMs provide an effective inference-time scaling approach that enables LLMs to process arbitrarily long prompts with improved quality and cost efficiency.

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability.

TL;DR: Iterative deployment of LLMs with user-curated data from previous deployments leads to significant model property changes, improving planning skills and enabling emergent generalization to longer plans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how iterative deployment of LLMs with user-curated data affects model properties, and to explore the implications of this process for AI safety and alternative training regimes.

Method: Iterative deployment of LLMs where each model is fine-tuned on data curated by users from previous model deployments, tested on various planning domains, with theoretical analysis connecting the process to reinforcement learning.

Result: Substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than initial models. Theoretical analysis shows iterative deployment implements implicit RL training with an undefined reward function.

Conclusion: Iterative deployment creates an implicit RL training loop with safety implications due to undefined reward functions, and offers an alternative training regime using data curation instead of explicit rewards.

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional visual word sense disambiguation methods using classical probability suffer from semantic biases in glosses from different sources, leading to biased results. Quantum superposition offers a better way to model semantic uncertainty.

Method: Proposes Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD) that encodes multiple glosses into quantum superposition states to mitigate biases, then executes quantum circuits and observes results. Also develops a heuristic classical version for efficient computation.

Result: Q-VWSD outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models. The quantum generalization provides theoretical advantages while the heuristic version enables practical implementation on classical computers.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates quantum machine learning's potential in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature, offering a bridge between quantum theory and practical implementation.

Abstract: Visual word sense disambiguation focuses on polysemous words, where candidate images can be easily confused. Traditional methods use classical probability to calculate the likelihood of an image matching each gloss of the target word, summing these to form a posterior probability. However, due to the challenge of semantic uncertainty, glosses from different sources inevitably carry semantic biases, which can lead to biased disambiguation results. Inspired by quantum superposition in modeling uncertainty, this paper proposes a Quantum Inference Model for Unsupervised Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (Q-VWSD). It encodes multiple glosses of the target word into a superposition state to mitigate semantic biases. Then, the quantum circuit is executed, and the results are observed. By formalizing our method, we find that Q-VWSD is a quantum generalization of the method based on classical probability. Building on this, we further designed a heuristic version of Q-VWSD that can run more efficiently on classical computing. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art classical methods, particularly by effectively leveraging non-specialized glosses from large language models, which further enhances performance. Our approach showcases the potential of quantum machine learning in practical applications and provides a case for leveraging quantum modeling advantages on classical computers while quantum hardware remains immature.

*Haijian Shao,Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Yingtao Jiang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: q-iPrune: A one-shot structured pruning framework for quantum neural networks using q-deformed groups and task-conditioned geometry to reduce gate-level redundancy with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum neural networks suffer from severe gate-level redundancy that hinders deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, creating a need for efficient pruning methods.

Method: Proposes q-iPrune framework based on algebraic structure of q-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry. Uses q-overlap distance to measure functional similarity of gates within algebraically consistent subgroups, removing gates only when replacement induces bounded deviation on task observables. Includes noise-calibrated deformation parameter λ to adapt to hardware imperfections.

Result: Achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation. Provides three theoretical guarantees: completeness of redundancy pruning, functional equivalence with explicit error bounds, and computational feasibility with polynomial-time comparisons.

Conclusion: q-iPrune offers a theoretically grounded, efficient pruning framework for QNNs that addresses gate-level redundancy while maintaining performance and adapting to hardware noise, enabling better deployment on NISQ devices.

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNNs) suffer from severe gate-level redundancy, which hinders their deployment on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we propose q-iPrune, a one-shot structured pruning framework grounded in the algebraic structure of $q$-deformed groups and task-conditioned quantum geometry.
  Unlike prior heuristic or gradient-based pruning methods, q-iPrune formulates redundancy directly at the gate level. Each gate is compared within an algebraically consistent subgroup using a task-conditioned $q$-overlap distance, which measures functional similarity through state overlaps on a task-relevant ensemble. A gate is removed only when its replacement by a subgroup representative provably induces a bounded deviation on all task observables.
  We establish three rigorous theoretical guarantees. First, we prove completeness of redundancy pruning: no gate that violates the prescribed similarity threshold is removed. Second, we show that the pruned circuit is functionally equivalent up to an explicit, task-conditioned error bound, with a closed-form dependence on the redundancy tolerance and the number of replaced gates. Third, we prove that the pruning procedure is computationally feasible, requiring only polynomial-time comparisons and avoiding exponential enumeration over the Hilbert space.
  To adapt pruning decisions to hardware imperfections, we introduce a noise-calibrated deformation parameter $λ$ that modulates the $q$-geometry and redundancy tolerance. Experiments on standard quantum machine learning benchmarks demonstrate that q-iPrune achieves substantial gate reduction while maintaining bounded task performance degradation, consistent with our theoretical guarantees.

*Guo Ye,Zexi Zhang,Xu Zhao,Shang Wu,Haoran Lu,Shihan Lu,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamTacVLA enhances Vision-Language-Action models with tactile sensing and future prediction for contact-rich manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models lack physical contact awareness, struggling with tasks requiring force, texture, and slip reasoning. Existing tactile approaches use low-dimensional signals that miss high-resolution dynamics essential for contact-rich manipulation.

Method: Introduces hierarchical perception with high-resolution tactile images, wrist-camera vision, and third-person vision. Uses Hierarchical Spatial Alignment loss to align tactile tokens with visual counterparts, then fine-tunes with a tactile world model predicting future tactile signals. Trains on hybrid dataset from digital twin and real-world experiments.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines on contact-rich manipulation tasks, achieving up to 95% success rate.

Conclusion: DreamTacVLA demonstrates that incorporating high-resolution tactile sensing and future prediction enables robust, touch-aware robotic agents capable of complex contact-rich manipulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable generalization by mapping web-scale knowledge to robotic control, yet they remain blind to physical contact. Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.

*Ming-Ming Yu,Yi Chen,Börje F. Karlsson,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RANGER is a zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that uses only monocular cameras, eliminating dependency on depth/pose sensors while enabling in-context learning from short videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current zero-shot object navigation methods rely heavily on precise depth/pose information (limiting real-world use) and lack in-context learning capability for quick adaptation to new environments.

Method: Uses 3D foundation models for keyframe-based 3D reconstruction and semantic point cloud generation, with VLM-driven exploration value estimation, adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution - all operating with monocular cameras only.

Result: Achieves competitive navigation success and exploration efficiency on HM3D benchmark and real-world environments, with superior in-context learning adaptability requiring no prior 3D mapping.

Conclusion: RANGER enables practical zero-shot semantic navigation in real-world settings by eliminating depth/pose dependencies and adding in-context learning capabilities through 3D foundation models.

Abstract: Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.

TL;DR: Dream2Flow bridges video generation and robotic control using 3D object flow as an intermediate representation, enabling zero-shot manipulation guidance for diverse object types without task-specific demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative video models can reason about plausible physical interactions, there's a gap between generating human-led motions and translating them into low-level robotic actions. The challenge is to leverage video generation capabilities for open-world robotic manipulation.

Method: Dream2Flow uses 3D object flow as an intermediate representation: 1) Generates videos from initial images and task instructions, 2) Reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos, 3) Formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking, 4) Converts 3D object flow to executable commands via trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning.

Result: The framework enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate diverse object categories (rigid, articulated, deformable, granular) without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: 3D object flow serves as an effective bridge between video generation models and robotic control, overcoming the embodiment gap and enabling scalable adaptation of video models to open-world manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Generative video modeling has emerged as a compelling tool to zero-shot reason about plausible physical interactions for open-world manipulation. Yet, it remains a challenge to translate such human-led motions into the low-level actions demanded by robotic systems. We observe that given an initial image and task instruction, these models excel at synthesizing sensible object motions. Thus, we introduce Dream2Flow, a framework that bridges video generation and robotic control through 3D object flow as an intermediate representation. Our method reconstructs 3D object motions from generated videos and formulates manipulation as object trajectory tracking. By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations. Simulation and real-world experiments highlight 3D object flow as a general and scalable interface for adapting video generation models to open-world robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: RAIR is a Chinese benchmark dataset for e-commerce search relevance evaluation that addresses the lack of standardized assessment by providing a rule-based framework with three specialized subsets for comprehensive model testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive relevance model assessment, and there's an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the e-commerce industry, despite LLMs showing significant results on relevance tasks.

Method: Created RAIR (Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment) - a Chinese dataset derived from real-world e-commerce scenarios. Established a standardized framework with universal rules, and designed three subsets: general (industry-balanced), long-tail hard (challenging cases), and visual salience (multimodal understanding).

Result: Tested 14 open and closed-source models on RAIR. The benchmark presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR successfully serves as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment.

Conclusion: RAIR provides a standardized evaluation framework for search relevance in e-commerce, offers new insights for general LLM and VLM evaluation, and addresses the gap in comprehensive relevance assessment benchmarks.

Abstract: Search relevance plays a central role in web e-commerce. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant results on relevance task, existing benchmarks lack sufficient complexity for comprehensive model assessment, resulting in an absence of standardized relevance evaluation metrics across the industry. To address this limitation, we propose Rule-Aware benchmark with Image for Relevance assessment(RAIR), a Chinese dataset derived from real-world scenarios. RAIR established a standardized framework for relevance assessment and provides a set of universal rules, which forms the foundation for standardized evaluation. Additionally, RAIR analyzes essential capabilities required for current relevance models and introduces a comprehensive dataset consists of three subset: (1) a general subset with industry-balanced sampling to evaluate fundamental model competencies; (2) a long-tail hard subset focus on challenging cases to assess performance limits; (3) a visual salience subset for evaluating multimodal understanding capabilities. We conducted experiments on RAIR using 14 open and closed-source models. The results demonstrate that RAIR presents sufficient challenges even for GPT-5, which achieved the best performance. RAIR data are now available, serving as an industry benchmark for relevance assessment while providing new insights into general LLM and Visual Language Model(VLM) evaluation.

*Yuan Xin,Dingfan Chen,Linyi Yang,Michael Backes,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Most jailbreak attacks can be detected by safety filters, suggesting prior evaluations overestimated their practical success. Safety filters need better recall-precision balance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak evaluations focus only on LLMs themselves, ignoring the full deployment pipeline with safety mechanisms like content moderation filters, creating a gap in understanding real-world attack effectiveness.

Method: First systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages.

Result: 1) Nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting prior assessments overestimated practical success. 2) Safety filters are effective but need better recall-precision balance for optimal protection and user experience.

Conclusion: Critical gaps exist in LLM safety systems, requiring further refinement of detection accuracy and usability to better protect against jailbreak attacks in real deployments.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed, ensuring their safe use is paramount. Jailbreaking, adversarial prompts that bypass model alignment to trigger harmful outputs, present significant risks, with existing studies reporting high success rates in evading common LLMs. However, previous evaluations have focused solely on the models, neglecting the full deployment pipeline, which typically incorporates additional safety mechanisms like content moderation filters. To address this gap, we present the first systematic evaluation of jailbreak attacks targeting LLM safety alignment, assessing their success across the full inference pipeline, including both input and output filtering stages. Our findings yield two key insights: first, nearly all evaluated jailbreak techniques can be detected by at least one safety filter, suggesting that prior assessments may have overestimated the practical success of these attacks; second, while safety filters are effective in detection, there remains room to better balance recall and precision to further optimize protection and user experience. We highlight critical gaps and call for further refinement of detection accuracy and usability in LLM safety systems.

*Vladimir Frants,Sos Agaian*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ADS is a training-free defense that neutralizes hidden payloads in diffusion-based steganography by using a pretrained denoiser and color-aware updates, effectively reducing decoder success rates with minimal visual impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of generative AI has enabled new covert communication methods using diffusion-based steganography, which can embed high-capacity payloads without fine-tuning or auxiliary decoders. These coverless techniques are difficult to detect as they generate image carriers directly from secret data, allowing attackers to bypass traditional detectors that rely on cover-stego discrepancies for delivering stegomalware.

Method: ADS (Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization) is a training-free defense that employs an off-the-shelf pretrained denoiser as a differentiable proxy for diffusion-based decoders. It incorporates a color-aware, quaternion-coupled update rule to reduce artifacts under strict distortion limits, neutralizing hidden payloads rather than detecting them.

Result: Under a practical threat model and evaluation against state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method Pulsar, ADS drives decoder success rates to near zero with minimal perceptual impact. It provides a favorable security-utility trade-off compared to standard content transformations.

Conclusion: ADS offers an effective mitigation strategy against diffusion-driven steganography by neutralizing hidden payloads rather than detecting them, providing a practical defense for security gateways against covert communication threats enabled by generative AI.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of generative AI has normalized large-scale synthetic media creation, enabling new forms of covert communication. Recent generative steganography methods, particularly those based on diffusion models, can embed high-capacity payloads without fine-tuning or auxiliary decoders, creating significant challenges for detection and remediation. Coverless diffusion-based techniques are difficult to counter because they generate image carriers directly from secret data, enabling attackers to deliver stegomalware for command-and-control, payload staging, and data exfiltration while bypassing detectors that rely on cover-stego discrepancies. This work introduces Adversarial Diffusion Sanitization (ADS), a training-free defense for security gateways that neutralizes hidden payloads rather than detecting them. ADS employs an off-the-shelf pretrained denoiser as a differentiable proxy for diffusion-based decoders and incorporates a color-aware, quaternion-coupled update rule to reduce artifacts under strict distortion limits. Under a practical threat model and in evaluation against the state-of-the-art diffusion steganography method Pulsar, ADS drives decoder success rates to near zero with minimal perceptual impact. Results demonstrate that ADS provides a favorable security-utility trade-off compared to standard content transformations, offering an effective mitigation strategy against diffusion-driven steganography.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AHA framework to address hallucinations in Large Audio-Language Models by creating a preference dataset through counterfactual hard negative mining, improving temporal reasoning and reducing grounding errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Audio-Language Models suffer from hallucinations where they generate text not grounded in audio input, with specific failure types including event omission, false event identity, temporal relation errors, and quantitative temporal errors.

Method: Introduces AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework using counterfactual hard negative mining to construct a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish acoustic evidence from fabrications. Also establishes AHA-Eval benchmark for testing temporal reasoning.

Result: Qwen-Audio-AHA (aligned Qwen2.5-Omni) achieves 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval and shows substantial gains on public benchmarks: 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.

Conclusion: The AHA framework effectively reduces hallucinations in audio-language models by improving temporal reasoning capabilities, with benefits generalizing beyond diagnostic benchmarks to public evaluation sets.

Abstract: Although Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) deliver state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, they frequently suffer from hallucinations, e.g. generating text not grounded in the audio input. We analyze these grounding failures and identify a distinct taxonomy: Event Omission, False Event Identity, Temporal Relation Error, and Quantitative Temporal Error. To address this, we introduce the AHA (Audio Hallucination Alignment) framework. By leveraging counterfactual hard negative mining, our pipeline constructs a high-quality preference dataset that forces models to distinguish strict acoustic evidence from linguistically plausible fabrications. Additionally, we establish AHA-Eval, a diagnostic benchmark designed to rigorously test these fine-grained temporal reasoning capabilities. We apply this data to align Qwen2.5-Omni. The resulting model, Qwen-Audio-AHA, achieves a 13.7% improvement on AHA-Eval. Crucially, this benefit generalizes beyond our diagnostic set. Our model shows substantial gains on public benchmarks, including 1.3% on MMAU-Test and 1.6% on MMAR, outperforming latest SOTA methods.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes vibe coding (LLM-assisted programming) as interface flattening that masks infrastructural thickening, redistributing power to model providers while creating new dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To critically examine the political economy of LLM-mediated programming, challenging the narrative of democratization by revealing how vibe coding redistributes control and obscures dependencies.

Method: Uses Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's interface theory to analyze vibe coding as interface flattening, reconstructing the contemporary vibe-coding stack to examine infrastructure, latency, structured outputs, function calling, and protocols like Model Context Protocol.

Result: Shows that while vibe coding appears to flatten interfaces (GUI, CLI, API into conversation), it actually lengthens and thickens the translation chain from intention to execution, relocating control to model/protocol providers and privatizing competencies previously distributed across programming communities.

Conclusion: LLM-mediated development creates new dependencies and literacies while obscuring responsibility, redistributing symbolic labor/power to corporate providers rather than democratizing programming, requiring critical examination of AI-mediated human-computer interaction's political economy.

Abstract: Large language models are reshaping programming by enabling 'vibe coding': the development of softwares through natural-language interaction with model-driven toolchains. This article argues that vibe coding is best understood as interface flattening, a reconfiguration in which previously distinct modalities (GUI, CLI, and API) appear to converge into a single conversational surface, even as the underlying chain of translation from intention to machinic effect lengthens and thickens. Drawing on Friedrich Kittler's materialist media theory and Alexander Galloway's account of interfaces as sites of protocol control, the paper situates programming as a historically localised interface arrangement rather than an essential relation to computation. Through a materialist reconstruction of the contemporary vibe-coding stack, it shows how remote compute infrastructures, latency and connectivity, structured outputs, function/tool calling, and interoperability standards such as the Model Context Protocol relocate control and meaning-making power to model and protocol providers. The apparent democratisation of technical capability therefore depends on new dependencies and new literacies. By foregrounding the tension between experiential flattening and infrastructural thickening, I demonstrate how LLM-mediated development redistributes symbolic labour/power, obscures responsibility, and privatises competencies previously dispersed across programming communities, contributing a critical lens on the political economy of AI-mediated human-computer interaction.

### [197] [A multimodal Transformer for InSAR-based ground deformation forecasting with cross-site generalization across Europe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23906)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A multimodal patch-based Transformer model for nowcasting ground deformation from InSAR time series, outperforming other models with RMSE = 0.90 mm and R² = 0.97.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Near-real-time monitoring of ground deformation is needed for urban planning, infrastructure management, and hazard mitigation. While InSAR and services like EGMS provide past motion data, predicting future observations is challenging due to complex superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, abrupt discontinuities, and spatial heterogeneity.

Method: Proposes a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series. The model ingests recent displacement snapshots along with: (1) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from training window only, and (2) harmonic day-of-year encodings. Tested on 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles.

Result: On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and R² = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal patch-based Transformer effectively addresses the challenge of ground deformation nowcasting by combining recent displacement data with kinematic indicators and temporal encodings, achieving superior performance compared to existing approaches for predicting next-epoch displacement maps.

Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.

*Mahdi Karami,Ali Behrouz,Praneeth Kacham,Vahab Mirrokni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Trellis is a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that dynamically compresses KV cache using a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism, enabling efficient long-context processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers suffer from quadratic computational complexity and growing KV cache memory requirements, which limits their efficiency for long-context applications.

Method: Replaces standard KV cache with fixed-size memory and trains a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism using online gradient descent with a forget gate to dynamically compress and update memory at test time.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series; performance gains increase with sequence length.

Conclusion: Trellis demonstrates potential for efficient long-context applications by providing bounded memory while maintaining or improving performance over standard Transformers.

Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

*Ruizhe Huang,Kexuan Zhang,Yihao Fang,Baifeng Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Infini-attention enhances long-context capabilities in small language models (300M params) by using compressed memory from past segments, achieving up to 31% higher accuracy than baseline despite some degradation at extreme lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient small language models (SLMs) for low-resource settings by improving long-context extrapolation capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency and reducing costs.

Method: Empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention, which builds compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention mechanisms.

Result: Infini-attention models show training stability and outperform baselines in long-context retrieval, achieving up to 31% higher accuracy despite some performance degradation at 16,384-token contexts.

Conclusion: Architectural memory mechanisms like Infini-attention effectively compensate for SLMs' limited parameters and are beneficial for achieving robust long-context capabilities in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.

*Advait Gadhikar,Riccardo Grazzi,James Hensman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptRot and OptRot+ are rotation-based methods that reduce weight outliers in LLMs to improve quantization performance, with OptRot+ incorporating activation covariance information for better results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have outliers in weights and activations that make quantization difficult. Existing rotation methods help mitigate outliers but need improvement.

Method: OptRot minimizes the element-wise fourth power of rotated weights to reduce outliers. OptRot+ adds data-dependent activation covariance information. Both use GPTQ as quantization method.

Result: OptRot outperforms Hadamard rotations, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves W4A8 activation quantization. OptRot+ further improves performance but both methods perform worse in W4A4 setting.

Conclusion: Rotation methods effectively reduce quantization errors, with OptRot+ providing best results by incorporating activation information, but there's a trade-off between weight and activation quantization in low-bit settings.

Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

*Yuma Ichikawa,Yoshihiko Fujisawa,Yudai Fujimoto,Akira Sakai,Katsuki Fujisawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDBF improves extreme low-bit LLM quantization by replacing DBF's single envelope with multiple rank-l envelopes while keeping binary sign bases, enhancing magnitude expressiveness without changing inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive for efficient LLM inference but has restrictive scaling parameters where all rank components share the same magnitude profile, causing performance saturation in extreme low-bit quantization.

Method: Propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF) that retains shared 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with rank-l envelopes. Shares sign matrices among envelope components to maintain binary carrier while using memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. Includes closed-form initialization and alternating refinement optimization.

Result: MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight across LLaMA and Qwen families while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

Conclusion: MDBF effectively addresses DBF's limitations by improving magnitude expressiveness while maintaining binary efficiency, making it a superior approach for extreme low-bit LLM quantization.

Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

### [202] [Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063)
*Diji Yang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans) convert standard LLMs into Bayesian models that can sample diverse model instances from a single pre-trained weight set, enabling population-level decision-making for improved exploration and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern transformers are trained as single deterministic systems, but intelligence emerges from many minds. The authors want to enable sampling of diverse yet coherent model instances from a single pre-trained model to leverage collective intelligence.

Method: B-Trans treats bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with Gaussian variational approximation, creating a Bayesian posterior proxy. Samples from this proxy yield diverse model instances while maintaining competence. To ensure coherence, sampled noise is frozen at sequence level for temporal consistency.

Result: Experiments in zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels show B-Trans yields superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines through population-level decision-making.

Conclusion: B-Trans successfully transforms standard LLMs into Bayesian models that support sampling diverse model instances, enabling wisdom-of-crowds effects that improve both exploration and task performance across various applications.

Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.

TL;DR: Researchers train language models for open-ended forecasting using automated news-based question synthesis, achieving state-of-the-art performance with their OpenForecaster 8B model that matches larger proprietary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-stakes decision making requires reasoning under uncertainty about future events, but existing language models lack specialized training for open-ended forecasting tasks.

Method: Automated synthesis of forecasting questions from daily news using offline corpus to prevent data leakage, training Qwen3 models on OpenForesight dataset with retrieval and improved RL reward function.

Result: OpenForecaster 8B matches larger proprietary models in accuracy, calibration, and consistency; forecasting training improves calibration across benchmarks; all models, code, and data open-sourced.

Conclusion: Specialized forecasting training enables language models to achieve competitive performance in open-ended prediction tasks, with calibration improvements that generalize beyond forecasting domains.

Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

### [204] [A Granular Grassmannian Clustering Framework via the Schubert Variety of Best Fit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23766)
*Karim Salta,Michael Kirby,Chris Peterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes SVBF-LBG: a subspace clustering algorithm using Schubert Variety of Best Fit as trainable prototypes instead of subspace means, improving cluster purity while maintaining geometric structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need better geometric representatives for datasets/clusters represented by subspaces (points on Grassmann/flag manifolds). Current methods use subspace means, but want trainable prototypes that better capture cluster structure while preserving mathematical geometry for downstream analysis.

Method: Introduces Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrates SVBF into Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline as trainable prototypes for subspace clustering.

Result: SVBF-LBG yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data compared to previous methods, while retaining mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

Conclusion: SVBF prototypes provide better geometric representatives for subspace clustering than traditional subspace means, offering both improved performance and preserved mathematical structure for subsequent analysis tasks.

Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

### [205] [GARDO: Reinforcing Diffusion Models without Reward Hacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24138)
*Haoran He,Yuxiao Ye,Jie Liu,Jiajun Liang,Zhiyong Wang,Ziyang Yuan,Xintao Wang,Hangyu Mao,Pengfei Wan,Ling Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GARDO is a reinforcement learning framework for fine-tuning diffusion models that addresses reward hacking and mode collapse through selective regularization, adaptive reference updates, and diversity-aware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL fine-tuning of diffusion models suffers from reward hacking (proxy scores increase while real quality deteriorates) and mode collapse due to imperfect proxy rewards. Existing regularization methods against reference policies compromise sample efficiency and exploration since reference policies are usually sub-optimal.

Method: GARDO introduces three key components: 1) Selective regularization that penalizes only high-uncertainty samples rather than universally, 2) Adaptive regularization where the reference model is periodically updated to match the online policy's capabilities, and 3) Diversity-aware optimization that amplifies rewards for high-quality, diverse samples to prevent mode collapse.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics show GARDO effectively mitigates reward hacking, enhances generation diversity, and maintains sample efficiency and exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: GARDO provides a versatile RL framework that successfully addresses the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and reward hacking mitigation in diffusion model fine-tuning through its selective, adaptive, and diversity-aware approach.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

*Soham Pahari,M. Srinivas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ViReLoc is a visual reasoning framework for spatial tasks like navigation and localization that uses only visual representations instead of text, learning spatial dependencies and geometric relations through reinforcement learning and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reasoning systems rely too heavily on textual information, limiting their effectiveness in spatial tasks like visual navigation and geo-localization. There's a need for systems that can understand spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text-based reasoning struggles with.

Method: Proposes Geo-Consistent Visual Planning framework called ViReLoc that performs planning and localization using only visual representations. Uses step-by-step visual inference encoding, reinforcement learning objectives, contrastive learning, and adaptive feature interaction to align cross-view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences.

Result: Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross-view retrieval performance. The system can perform spatial tasks without real-time GPS data.

Conclusion: Visual reasoning is a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization tasks. ViReLoc demonstrates that such tasks can be performed without real-time GPS data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

### [207] [Generative Classifiers Avoid Shortcut Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25034)
*Alexander C. Li,Ananya Kumar,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative classifiers using class-conditional generative models outperform discriminative classifiers on distribution shift by avoiding overreliance on spurious correlations, achieving SOTA on 5 benchmarks without specialized techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discriminative classifiers often learn shortcuts/spurious correlations that work in-distribution but fail under minor distribution shifts. This overreliance on spurious features is a fundamental limitation of discriminative approaches.

Method: Use class-conditional generative models (diffusion-based and autoregressive) as generative classifiers. These models all features (both core and spurious) rather than mainly focusing on spurious ones. Simple to train without specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or prior knowledge of spurious correlations.

Result: Generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks. They reduce impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications (medical/satellite datasets). Analysis of Gaussian toy setting reveals inductive biases of generative classifiers and data properties determining when they outperform discriminative ones.

Conclusion: Generative classifiers provide a simple yet effective solution to distribution shift problems by avoiding overreliance on spurious correlations, offering robust performance without complex training procedures or prior knowledge of spurious features.

Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.
