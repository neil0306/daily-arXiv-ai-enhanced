### [1] [StreetMath: Study of LLMs' Approximation Behaviors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25776)
*Chiung-Yi Tseng,Somshubhra Roy,Maisha Thasin,Danyang Zhang,Blessing Effiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces StreetMath, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' approximation abilities in informal mathematical reasoning, revealing that models tend to compute exact values rather than approximate, consume more tokens for approximation tasks, and use separate neural components for exact vs. approximate operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs' ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced mathematical operations, particularly among non-autoregressive decoder models, which has received less attention compared to precise arithmetic operations.

Method: Introduced StreetMath benchmark for evaluating approximation abilities under real-world scenarios, conducted extensive evaluations across multiple LLM architectures (Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507, Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, Mamba-GPT-3B), and applied mechanistic interpretability techniques to probe internal computational states.

Result: LLMs generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in tasks requiring approximation; models sometimes reach correct answers early but still consume more tokens; exact and approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.

Conclusion: LLMs do not exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math settings, as they tend to over-compute rather than approximate efficiently.

Abstract: There is a substantial body of literature examining the mathematical
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
performance on precise arithmetic operations in autoregressive architectures.
However, their ability to perform approximate reasoning in informal, fast-paced
mathematical operations has received far less attention, especially among
non-autoregressive decoder models. Our work addresses this gap by introducing
StreetMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate models' approximation abilities
under real-world approximation scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations
across different LLM architectures: Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507,
Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507, Dream-v0-Instruct-7B, Falcon-Mamba-7B-Instruct, and
Mamba-GPT-3B. Furthermore, we apply mechanistic interpretability techniques to
probe their internal computational states. Our analysis reveals that LLMs
generally attempt to compute exact values or invoke external tools even in
tasks that call for approximation. Moreover, while models sometimes reach the
correct answer in early layers or steps, they still consume more tokens when
solving approximation tasks. Additional experiments indicate that exact and
approximate arithmetic operations rely on largely separate neural components.
Drawing upon research on cognitive psychology, we argue that LLMs do not
exhibit cognitive miserliness in the same way humans do in street math
settings. We open source our work https://github.com/ctseng777/StreetMath

### [2] [Review Based Entity Ranking using Fuzzy Logic Algorithmic Approach: Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25778)
*Pratik N. Kalamkar,Anupama G. Phakatkar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a fuzzy logic-based approach for sentiment analysis that considers both opinion orientation and strength at granular levels (very weak to very strong), using syntactic dependency resolution to relate opinion words to specific product aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional lexicon-based sentiment analysis approaches fail to capture the strength/intensity of opinions, treating all positive/negative opinions equally without considering their intensity levels.

Method: Combines fuzzy logic to classify opinion words into granular intensity categories (very weak, weak, moderate, strong, very strong) and uses syntactic dependency resolution to identify relationships between opinion words and specific product aspects.

Result: The approach enables ranking entities based on both the orientation and strength of reviews, providing more nuanced sentiment analysis that considers opinion intensity for specific product aspects.

Conclusion: The proposed method offers a more sophisticated sentiment analysis framework that captures opinion strength granularity and aspect-specific sentiment, improving over traditional binary or coarse-grained sentiment classification approaches.

Abstract: Opinion mining, also called sentiment analysis, is the field of study that
analyzes people opinions, sentiments, evaluations, appraisals, attitudes, and
emotions towards entities such as products, services, organizations,
individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes. Holistic
lexicon-based approach does not consider the strength of each opinion, i.e.,
whether the opinion is very strongly negative (or positive), strongly negative
(or positive), moderate negative (or positive), very weakly negative (or
positive) and weakly negative (or positive). In this paper, we propose approach
to rank entities based on orientation and strength of the entity reviews and
user's queries by classifying them in granularity levels (i.e. very weak, weak,
moderate, very strong and strong) by combining opinion words (i.e. adverb,
adjective, noun and verb) that are related to aspect of interest of certain
product. We shall use fuzzy logic algorithmic approach in order to classify
opinion words into different category and syntactic dependency resolution to
find relations for desired aspect words. Opinion words related to certain
aspects of interest are considered to find the entity score for that aspect in
the review.

### [3] [LASTIST: LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25783)
*DongJae Kim,Yaejin Lee,Minsu Park,Eunil Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces LASTIST, a large-scale Korean dataset for target-independent stance detection, addressing the lack of resources in low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most stance detection research focuses on target-dependent tasks and English datasets, creating a gap for low-resource languages like Korean and target-independent approaches.

Method: Collected 563,299 labeled Korean sentences from political party press releases and trained state-of-the-art deep learning models for stance detection.

Result: Created the LASTIST dataset supporting target-independent stance detection and diachronic evolution analysis, making it publicly available online.

Conclusion: LASTIST fills a critical research gap by providing a large-scale Korean dataset for target-independent stance detection, enabling future research in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Stance detection has emerged as an area of research in the field of
artificial intelligence. However, most research is currently centered on the
target-dependent stance detection task, which is based on a person's stance in
favor of or against a specific target. Furthermore, most benchmark datasets are
based on English, making it difficult to develop models in low-resource
languages such as Korean, especially for an emerging field such as stance
detection. This study proposes the LArge-Scale Target-Independent STance
(LASTIST) dataset to fill this research gap. Collected from the press releases
of both parties on Korean political parties, the LASTIST dataset uses 563,299
labeled Korean sentences. We provide a detailed description of how we collected
and constructed the dataset and trained state-of-the-art deep learning and
stance detection models. Our LASTIST dataset is designed for various tasks in
stance detection, including target-independent stance detection and diachronic
evolution stance detection. We deploy our dataset on
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LASTIST-3721/.

### [4] [zFLoRA: Zero-Latency Fused Low-Rank Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25784)
*Dhananjaya Gowda,Seoha Song,Harshith Goka,Junhyun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: zFLoRA is a zero-latency fused low-rank adapter that eliminates inference overhead while maintaining performance comparable to LoRA and full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-specific adapters in LLMs, though small in parameter count (<1% of base model), cause significant inference latency (up to 2.5x base model), creating deployment bottlenecks.

Method: Proposed zFLoRA - a fused low-rank adapter approach that integrates adapter parameters into the base model without additional computational overhead during inference.

Result: zFLoRA achieves comparable performance to LoRA and full fine-tuning across 18 tasks in commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, and summary-dialogue, with zero to negligible latency overhead on both NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) and GPU (NVIDIA H100) platforms.

Conclusion: zFLoRA enables efficient deployment of task-specific LLMs without inference latency penalties, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed with task-specific
adapters catering to multiple downstream applications. In such a scenario, the
additional compute associated with these apparently insignificant number of
adapter parameters (typically less than 1% of the base model) turns out to be
disproportionately significant during inference time (upto 2.5x times that of
the base model). In this paper, we propose a new zero-latency fused low-rank
adapter (zFLoRA) that introduces zero or negligible latency overhead on top of
the base model. Experimental results on LLMs of size 1B, 3B and 7B show that
zFLoRA compares favorably against the popular supervised fine-tuning benchmarks
including low-rank adapters (LoRA) as well as full fine-tuning (FFT).
Experiments are conducted on 18 different tasks across three different
categories namely commonsense reasoning, math reasoning and summary-dialogue.
Latency measurements made on NPU (Samsung Galaxy S25+) as well as GPU (NVIDIA
H100) platforms show that the proposed zFLoRA adapters introduce zero to
negligible latency overhead.

### [5] [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Improving Circuit Faithfulness via Better Edge Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25786)
*Yaniv Nikankin,Dana Arad,Itay Itzhak,Anja Reusch,Adi Simhi,Gal Kesten-Pomeranz,Yonatan Belinkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Improved circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability using bootstrapping, ratio-based edge selection, and integer linear programming to find more faithful circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of identifying which parts of a model perform specific tasks in mechanistic interpretability, building on the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB).

Method: Three key improvements: 1) bootstrapping for consistent attribution scores, 2) ratio-based selection strategy for prioritizing strong positive-scoring edges, 3) integer linear programming instead of greedy selection.

Result: Methods yield more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB tasks and models.

Conclusion: The proposed improvements successfully enhance circuit discovery in mechanistic interpretability, providing better performance and faithfulness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in mechanistic interpretability is circuit
discovery, determining which parts of a model perform a given task. We build on
the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) and propose three key
improvements to circuit discovery. First, we use bootstrapping to identify
edges with consistent attribution scores. Second, we introduce a simple
ratio-based selection strategy to prioritize strong positive-scoring edges,
balancing performance and faithfulness. Third, we replace the standard greedy
selection with an integer linear programming formulation. Our methods yield
more faithful circuits and outperform prior approaches across multiple MIB
tasks and models. Our code is available at:

### [6] [LISTEN to Your Preferences: An LLM Framework for Multi-Objective Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25799)
*Adam S. Jovine,Tinghan Ye,Francis Bahk,Jingjing Wang,David B. Shmoys,Peter I. Frazier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN framework uses LLMs as zero-shot preference oracles to help experts select optimal options from large sets with multiple objectives, using natural language guidance instead of formal preference modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human experts struggle with formalizing complex, implicit preferences when selecting from large option sets with competing objectives, creating a cognitive bottleneck in decision-making.

Method: Two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U (refines parametric utility function using LLM) and LISTEN-T (non-parametric tournament-style selection over small solution batches). Both leverage LLMs as preference oracles guided by natural language priorities.

Result: Evaluated on flight booking, shopping, and exam scheduling tasks. LISTEN-U performs best when preferences are parametrically aligned (measured by novel concordance metric), while LISTEN-T offers more robust overall performance.

Conclusion: LISTEN demonstrates promising direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions using natural language, reducing cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation methods.

Abstract: Human experts often struggle to select the best option from a large set of
items with multiple competing objectives, a process bottlenecked by the
difficulty of formalizing complex, implicit preferences. To address this, we
introduce LISTEN, a framework that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as a
zero-shot preference oracle, guided only by an expert's high-level priorities
in natural language. To operate within LLM constraints like context windows and
inference costs, we propose two iterative algorithms: LISTEN-U, which uses the
LLM to refine a parametric utility function, and LISTEN-T, a non-parametric
method that performs tournament-style selections over small batches of
solutions. Evaluated on diverse tasks including flight booking, shopping, and
exam scheduling, our results show LISTEN-U excels when preferences are
parametrically aligned (a property we measure with a novel concordance metric),
while LISTEN-T offers more robust performance. This work explores a promising
direction for steering complex multi-objective decisions directly with natural
language, reducing the cognitive burden of traditional preference elicitation.

### [7] [Beyond Length: Quantifying Long-Range Information for Long-Context LLM Pretraining Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25804)
*Haoran Deng,Yingyu Lin,Zhenghao Lin,Xiao Liu,Yizhou Sun,Yi-An Ma,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongFilter is a framework for selecting training data with meaningful long-distance dependencies for long-context language model pretraining, improving model performance on long-context benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most available long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies, making training inefficient. Careful data selection is crucial for effective long-context pretraining.

Method: LongFilter measures information gain by contrasting model predictions under long-context vs short-context settings to identify samples where long-range dependencies are essential.

Result: Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B extending context from 8K to 64K tokens show LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial improvements on HELMET, LongBench, and RULER benchmarks.

Conclusion: LongFilter provides an effective framework for curating training data specifically tailored for long-context pretraining, addressing the inefficiency of training on data lacking meaningful long-distance dependencies.

Abstract: Long-context language models unlock advanced capabilities in reasoning, code
generation, and document summarization by leveraging dependencies across
extended spans of text. However, a significant portion of readily available
long-text data lacks meaningful long-distance dependencies; most spans can be
predicted using only local context. Training on such data is inefficient,
making careful data selection crucial. Therefore, we introduce LongFilter, a
framework for curating training data tailored to long-context pretraining.
LongFilter measures the information gain provided by extended context by
contrasting model predictions under long-context versus short-context settings,
thereby identifying samples where long-range dependencies are essential.
Experiments with LLaMA-3-8B, extending its context length from 8K to 64K, show
that LongFilter efficiently selects high-quality data and yields substantial
improvements on benchmarks such as HELMET, LongBench, and RULER.

### [8] [Ideology-Based LLMs for Content Moderation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25805)
*Stefano Civelli,Pietro Bernardelle,Nardiena A. Pratama,Gianluca Demartini*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Persona adoption in LLMs introduces subtle ideological biases in harmful content classification, with models showing stronger alignment with personas sharing their political ideology and increased divergence across ideological groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how persona adoption influences fairness and consistency in harmful content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and content modalities, given the increasing use of LLMs in content moderation systems.

Method: Analyzed persona conditioning effects on LLMs through harmful content classification tasks across different architectures and sizes, with additional study on politically targeted tasks to examine ideological alignment and perspective defense behaviors.

Result: Personas with different ideological leanings show distinct propensities to label content as harmful; larger models align more closely with personas from same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while widening cross-ideology divergence; personas defend their perspectives while downplaying harmfulness in opposing views.

Conclusion: Persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM outputs, raising concerns about AI systems potentially reinforcing partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality in content moderation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in content moderation
systems, where ensuring fairness and neutrality is essential. In this study, we
examine how persona adoption influences the consistency and fairness of harmful
content classification across different LLM architectures, model sizes, and
content modalities (language vs. vision). At first glance, headline performance
metrics suggest that personas have little impact on overall classification
accuracy. However, a closer analysis reveals important behavioral shifts.
Personas with different ideological leanings display distinct propensities to
label content as harmful, showing that the lens through which a model "views"
input can subtly shape its judgments. Further agreement analyses highlight that
models, particularly larger ones, tend to align more closely with personas from
the same political ideology, strengthening within-ideology consistency while
widening divergence across ideological groups. To show this effect more
directly, we conducted an additional study on a politically targeted task,
which confirmed that personas not only behave more coherently within their own
ideology but also exhibit a tendency to defend their perspective while
downplaying harmfulness in opposing views. Together, these findings highlight
how persona conditioning can introduce subtle ideological biases into LLM
outputs, raising concerns about the use of AI systems that may reinforce
partisan perspectives under the guise of neutrality.

### [9] [Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25816)
*Tarun Kumar Chawdhury,Jon D. Duke*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLEAR method uses entity-aware retrieval for clinical question answering, achieving better performance with 78% fewer tokens than traditional methods, especially on long EHR documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships in EHR documents, and base64 encoding makes semantic question answering difficult.

Method: Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method using entity aware retrieval, validated against zero-shot large context inference and traditional chunk-based retrieval augmented generation on 12 clinical notes ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens.

Result: CLEAR achieved F1 score of 0.90 vs 0.86 for embedding-based retrieval, 58.3% win rate, average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78% fewer tokens than wide context processing. Largest gains on long notes (75% win rate for 65,000+ token documents).

Conclusion: Entity aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical NLP, and the evaluation framework provides reusable benchmark for clinical QA systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64
encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic
question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss
nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR)
method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and
achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for
embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We
developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against
zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval
augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from
10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a
58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78
percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance
gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents
exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval
improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing.
The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for
assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and
computational efficiency are critical.

### [10] [A Survey on Efficient Large Language Model Training: From Data-centric Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25817)
*Junyu Luo,Bohan Wu,Xiao Luo,Zhiping Xiao,Yiqiao Jin,Rong-Cheng Tu,Nan Yin,Yifan Wang,Jingyang Yuan,Wei Ju,Ming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic survey of data-efficient LLM post-training methods from a data-centric perspective, proposing a taxonomy covering data selection, quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation, and self-evolving data ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM post-training faces significant data challenges including high manual annotation costs and diminishing returns on data scales, making data-efficient post-training a crucial research question.

Method: The authors conducted a systematic survey and proposed a taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, categorizing approaches into data selection, quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation/compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems.

Result: The paper summarizes representative approaches in each category and provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of data-efficient LLM post-training methods.

Conclusion: The work highlights open problems and proposes future research directions, aiming to inspire further exploration into maximizing data utilization potential in large-scale model training.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for unlocking their
task generalization potential and domain-specific capabilities. However, the
current LLM post-training paradigm faces significant data challenges, including
the high costs of manual annotation and diminishing marginal returns on data
scales. Therefore, achieving data-efficient post-training has become a key
research question. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of
data-efficient LLM post-training from a data-centric perspective. We propose a
taxonomy of data-efficient LLM post-training methods, covering data selection,
data quality enhancement, synthetic data generation, data distillation and
compression, and self-evolving data ecosystems. We summarize representative
approaches in each category and outline future research directions. By
examining the challenges in data-efficient LLM post-training, we highlight open
problems and propose potential research avenues. We hope our work inspires
further exploration into maximizing the potential of data utilization in
large-scale model training. Paper List:

### [11] [Evaluating the Impact of LLM-Assisted Annotation in a Perspectivized Setting: the Case of FrameNet Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25904)
*Frederico Belcavello,Ely Matos,Arthur Lorenzi,Lisandra Bonoto,Lívia Ruiz,Luiz Fernando Pereira,Victor Herbst,Yulla Navarro,Helen de Andrade Abreu,Lívia Dutra,Tiago Timponi Torrent*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation of LLM-based semantic role labeling for FrameNet annotation shows semi-automatic approach increases frame diversity while maintaining coverage, outperforming fully automatic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the performance and impact of LLM-based tools in creating annotated datasets, particularly for semantic annotation tasks, as comprehensive evaluation under perspectivized NLP approaches is lacking.

Method: Compared annotation time, coverage and diversity across three settings: manual, automatic (LLM-only), and semi-automatic (human-LLM hybrid) annotation using FrameNet-like semantic annotation.

Result: Semi-automatic annotation achieved increased frame diversity and similar coverage compared to manual annotation, while automatic annotation performed worse in all metrics except annotation time.

Conclusion: Hybrid semi-automatic annotation using LLMs is effective for semantic annotation tasks, balancing efficiency with quality, while fully automatic approaches have limitations despite speed advantages.

Abstract: The use of LLM-based applications as a means to accelerate and/or substitute
human labor in the creation of language resources and dataset is a reality.
Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research,
comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of
annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still
missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an
extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic
annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology
employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental
settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation. Results show that
the hybrid, semi-automatic annotation setting leads to increased frame
diversity and similar annotation coverage, when compared to the human-only
setting, while the automatic setting performs considerably worse in all
metrics, except for annotation time.

### [12] [RECAP: Reproducing Copyrighted Data from LLMs Training with an Agentic Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25941)
*André V. Duarte,Xuying li,Bin Zeng,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Lei Li,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP is an agentic pipeline that uses feedback loops and jailbreaking to extract and verify memorized training data from LLMs, achieving 24% improvement in extracting copyrighted text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To detect what training data LLMs have seen when direct inspection is impossible, by eliciting and verifying memorized content through model outputs.

Method: Uses a feedback-driven loop where initial extractions are evaluated by a secondary model, discrepancies are identified and translated into correction hints, and includes a jailbreaking module to overcome alignment-induced refusals.

Result: On EchoTrace benchmark spanning 30+ books, RECAP improved average ROUGE-L score for copyrighted text extraction from 0.38 to 0.47 (24% increase) with GPT-4.1.

Conclusion: RECAP provides an effective method for detecting memorized training data in LLMs through iterative feedback and jailbreaking techniques, significantly outperforming single-iteration approaches.

Abstract: If we cannot inspect the training data of a large language model (LLM), how
can we ever know what it has seen? We believe the most compelling evidence
arises when the model itself freely reproduces the target content. As such, we
propose RECAP, an agentic pipeline designed to elicit and verify memorized
training data from LLM outputs. At the heart of RECAP is a feedback-driven
loop, where an initial extraction attempt is evaluated by a secondary language
model, which compares the output against a reference passage and identifies
discrepancies. These are then translated into minimal correction hints, which
are fed back into the target model to guide subsequent generations. In
addition, to address alignment-induced refusals, RECAP includes a jailbreaking
module that detects and overcomes such barriers. We evaluate RECAP on
EchoTrace, a new benchmark spanning over 30 full books, and the results show
that RECAP leads to substantial gains over single-iteration approaches. For
instance, with GPT-4.1, the average ROUGE-L score for the copyrighted text
extraction improved from 0.38 to 0.47 - a nearly 24% increase.

### [13] [Revisiting Multilingual Data Mixtures in Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25947)
*Negar Foroutan,Paul Teiletche,Ayush Kumar Tarun,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study challenges common assumptions about multilingual LLM training, finding that combining English and multilingual data doesn't degrade performance when languages have sufficient tokens, English serves as an effective pivot language across families, and the 'curse of multilinguality' doesn't significantly affect models at 1.1B-3B scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining LLMs and address concerns about trade-offs between language coverage and model performance (the curse of multilinguality).

Method: Trained 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400, and analyzed performance across different language mixtures and pivot language strategies.

Result: Found that English-multilingual combinations don't degrade performance with sufficient tokens; English as pivot language benefits all language families; no significant curse of multilinguality observed at this scale.

Conclusion: Multilingual data, when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings.

Abstract: The impact of different multilingual data mixtures in pretraining large
language models (LLMs) has been a topic of ongoing debate, often raising
concerns about potential trade-offs between language coverage and model
performance (i.e., the curse of multilinguality). In this work, we investigate
these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse
multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study
challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find
that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the
in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a
sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we
observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language
that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits
across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot
language from within a specific family does not consistently improve
performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a
significant "curse of multilinguality" as the number of training languages
increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data,
when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without
compromising performance, even in low-resource settings

### [14] [Semantic Label Drift in Cross-Cultural Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25967)
*Mohsinul Kabir,Tasnim Ahmed,Md Mezbaur Rahman,Polydoros Giannouris,Sophia Ananiadou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Machine Translation systems, including LLMs, cause label drift during translation due to cultural divergence between languages, especially in culturally sensitive domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the underexplored role of cultural alignment in Machine Translation and how it affects semantic label preservation during translation.

Method: Conducted experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral domains using various MT systems including modern LLMs, analyzing label drift and cultural knowledge encoding.

Result: Found that MT systems induce label drift, LLMs encode cultural knowledge that amplifies drift, and cultural similarity between languages is crucial for label preservation.

Conclusion: Neglecting cultural factors in MT undermines label fidelity and risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in downstream applications.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) is widely employed to address resource scarcity in
low-resource languages by generating synthetic data from high-resource
counterparts. While sentiment preservation in translation has long been
studied, a critical but underexplored factor is the role of cultural alignment
between source and target languages. In this paper, we hypothesize that
semantic labels are drifted or altered during MT due to cultural divergence.
Through a series of experiments across culturally sensitive and neutral
domains, we establish three key findings: (1) MT systems, including modern
Large Language Models (LLMs), induce label drift during translation,
particularly in culturally sensitive domains; (2) unlike earlier statistical MT
tools, LLMs encode cultural knowledge, and leveraging this knowledge can
amplify label drift; and (3) cultural similarity or dissimilarity between
source and target languages is a crucial determinant of label preservation. Our
findings highlight that neglecting cultural factors in MT not only undermines
label fidelity but also risks misinterpretation and cultural conflict in
downstream applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex mathematical reasoning where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically unsound solutions, lacking deterministic verification mechanisms.

Method: Reframes mathematical problem-solving as verifiable code generation using the SymPy library, grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic symbolic engine.

Result: Achieved significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over baselines on MATH-500 and OlympiadBench benchmarks, with better token efficiency and transparent error types.

Conclusion: SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and trustworthy AI in formal domains by shifting failures from opaque logical fallacies to transparent programmatic errors.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex mathematical
reasoning, where prose-based generation leads to unverified and arithmetically
unsound solutions. Current prompting strategies like Chain of Thought still
operate within this unreliable medium, lacking a mechanism for deterministic
verification. To address these limitations, we introduce SymCode, a
neurosymbolic framework that reframes mathematical problem-solving as a task of
verifiable code generation using the SymPy library. We evaluate SymCode on
challenging benchmarks, including MATH-500 and OlympiadBench, demonstrating
significant accuracy improvements of up to 13.6 percentage points over
baselines. Our analysis shows that SymCode is not only more token-efficient but
also fundamentally shifts model failures from opaque logical fallacies towards
transparent, programmatic errors. By grounding LLM reasoning in a deterministic
symbolic engine, SymCode represents a key step towards more accurate and
trustworthy AI in formal domains.

### [16] [NeuronMM: High-Performance Matrix Multiplication for LLM Inference on AWS Trainium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25977)
*Dinghong Song,Jierui Xu,Weichu Yang,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents high-performance matrix multiplication optimizations for LLM inference on AWS Trainium AI accelerators, achieving significant speedups over existing implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AWS Trainium accelerators provide cost-effective AI solutions but present challenges for high performance due to their systolic array architecture and data layout requirements, particularly for critical matrix multiplication operations in LLM inference.

Method: The authors designed customized techniques for Trainium including kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive matrix transpose operations.

Result: Evaluation across nine datasets and four recent LLMs showed average 1.35x speedup (up to 2.22x) at the matrix multiplication kernel level, translating to average 1.66x speedup (up to 2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference compared to AWS's state-of-the-art implementation.

Conclusion: The proposed optimization techniques successfully address Trainium's architectural challenges and significantly improve LLM inference performance on AWS's AI accelerators.

Abstract: AI accelerators, customized to AI workloads, provide cost-effective and
high-performance solutions for training and inference. Trainium, an AI
accelerator recently developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides an
attractive option for LLM training and inference through its heterogeneous
architecture. However, leveraging Trainium architecture for high performance
can be challenging because of its systolic array architecture and special
requirement on data layout. In this paper, we design high-performance matrix
multiplication (matmul), a critical compute kernel, for LLM inference on
Trainium. We introduce a series of techniques customized to Trainium based on
kernel fusion and novel caching strategies to reduce data movement across the
software-managed memory hierarchy, maximize SRAM bandwidth, and avoid expensive
matrix transpose. Evaluating with nine datasets and four recent LLMs, we show
that our system largely outperforms the state-of-the-art matmul implemented by
AWS on Trainium: at the level of matmul kernel, it achieves an average 1.35x
speedup (up to 2.22x), which translates to an average 1.66x speedup (up to
2.49x) for end-to-end LLM inference.

*Dinghong Song,Yuan Feng,Yiwei Wang,Shangye Chen,Cyril Guyot,Filip Blagojevic,Hyeran Jeon,Pengfei Su,Dong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AttnCache is a framework that accelerates LLM prefill inference by caching and reusing similar attention maps, reducing self-attention computation overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world workloads rely only on prefill inference where self-attention's quadratic complexity becomes a bottleneck, and semantically different sentences often produce similar attention maps.

Method: Builds an attention map memorization database and uses efficient caching and similarity search to retrieve and reuse similar attention maps during inference.

Result: Achieves 1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x attention speedup on GPU with negligible accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: AttnCache effectively accelerates prefill-stage LLM inference by exploiting attention map similarity across different inputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in generative applications such
as chatting, code generation, and reasoning. However, many realworld workloads
such as classification, question answering, recommendation, and text embedding
rely solely on the prefill stage of inference, where the model encodes input
sequences without performing autoregressive decoding. In these prefill only
scenarios, the self-attention computation becomes the primary performance
bottleneck due to its quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length. In
this paper, we observe that semantically different sentences often produce
similar attention maps across layers and heads. Building on this insight, we
propose AttnCache, a framework that accelerates the prefill stage of LLM
inference by retrieving and reusing similar attention maps. Based on an
attention map memorization database, AttnCache employs efficient caching and
similarity search techniques to identify and reuse pre-cached attention maps
during inference, thereby reducing the computational overhead of
self-attention. Experimental results show that AttnCache achieves an average of
1.2x end-to-end and 2x attention speedup on CPU, and 1.6x end-to-end and 3x
attention speedup on GPU, with negligible accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SRL is a new training framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning to help small LLMs solve multi-step reasoning problems by generating logical action sequences with internal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks. Small models fail with RLVR when correct solutions are rarely sampled, while SFT overfits through rigid imitation of demonstrations.

Method: SRL reformulates problem solving as generating sequences of logical actions. It trains models to generate internal reasoning monologues before each action, providing step-wise rewards based on similarity to expert actions from SFT data.

Result: SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Combining SRL initialization with RLVR refinement yields the strongest performance. SRL also generalizes well to agentic software engineering tasks.

Conclusion: SRL is a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs that bridges the gap between SFT and RLVR, providing richer learning signals and encouraging flexible reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require
multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely
sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to
overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address
this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that
reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical "actions". SRL
trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing
to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between
the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a
step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all
rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert
demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging
problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training
with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance.
Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software
engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework
for reasoning-oriented LLMs.

*Feijie Wu,Weiwu Zhu,Yuxiang Zhang,Soumya Chatterjee,Jiarong Zhu,Fan Mo,Rodin Luo,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PORTool is a reinforcement learning method that trains tool-use LLMs to explore multiple tool-call trajectories through step-wise rewards and fork-relative advantages, improving performance in dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tool-use LLMs trained on static datasets fail to explore possible solutions and show limited performance in dynamic tool-call environments, as they only imitate generic tool-call routines.

Method: PORTool generates multiple rollouts forming tree-like structures, assigns step-wise rewards based on answer correctness and successful tool calls, and uses fork-relative advantages blended with trajectory-relative advantages to train the LLM.

Result: Experiments with 17 tools show significant improvements in final accuracy and reduction in tool-call steps compared to other training approaches, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of step-wise rewards.

Conclusion: PORTool effectively enhances tool-use LLMs' exploration capabilities and performance in dynamic environments through reinforcement learning with structured reward mechanisms.

Abstract: Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets,
enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step,
tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However,
these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine,
thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited
performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we
propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a
tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer.
Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given
query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a
tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability
to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step
across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps
under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards
are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with
trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments
utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and
time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify
the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate
significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.

### [20] [Rethinking Cross-lingual Alignment: Balancing Transfer and Cultural Erasure in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26024)
*HyoJung Han,Sweta Agrawal,Eleftheria Briakou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies a trade-off in cross-lingual alignment where improving factual knowledge transfer across languages comes at the cost of cultural localization, and proposes Surgical Steering to balance both objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of 'cultural erasure' in cross-lingual alignment, where pursuit of representational convergence causes loss of culturally-situated responses that should differ based on query language.

Method: Introduces a transfer-localization plane evaluation framework, analyzes CLA approaches, and proposes Surgical Steering - an inference-time method that applies targeted activation steering to different model layers to disentangle factual transfer from cultural knowledge.

Result: Found that current CLA approaches consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all six languages studied. Surgical Steering achieves better balance between the two competing dimensions.

Conclusion: Universal factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers, enabling targeted approaches like Surgical Steering to overcome limitations of current alignment techniques.

Abstract: Cross-lingual alignment (CLA) aims to align multilingual representations,
enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to seamlessly transfer knowledge across
languages. While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational
convergence can inadvertently cause "cultural erasure", the functional loss of
providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query
language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing
a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which
quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure.
Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they
consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural
localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the
internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal
factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at
different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a
novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying
targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better
balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the
limitations of current alignment techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Developed NLP pipeline to identify incidental thyroid findings in radiology reports, finding 7.8% prevalence with strong association to thyroid cancer detection cascade, suggesting overdiagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incidental thyroid findings are increasingly detected but their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined, requiring systematic assessment.

Method: Retrospective cohort study using transformer-based NLP pipeline to identify ITFs from radiology reports across multiple imaging modalities in adults without prior thyroid disease.

Result: 7.8% of 115,683 patients had ITFs (92.9% nodules), with poor documentation of nodule characteristics. ITFs strongly associated with higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy and cancer detection.

Conclusion: ITFs are common and drive cascades leading to detection of small, low-risk cancers, highlighting role in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and need for standardized reporting and selective follow-up.

Abstract: Importance Incidental thyroid findings (ITFs) are increasingly detected on
imaging performed for non-thyroid indications. Their prevalence, features, and
clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and
deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in
radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior
thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from
July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline
identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from
multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of
ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer
diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related
factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9%
women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more
likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was
ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were
more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule
characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other
features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients
without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis,
biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were
papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were
common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small,
low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer
overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective
follow-up.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QCoder Benchmark is an evaluation framework for assessing LLMs on quantum programming with hardware feedback, showing that reasoning-based models significantly outperform standard LLMs and human coders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs for quantum programming that requires interaction with hardware devices, where conventional code generation approaches are insufficient.

Method: Introduces QCoder Benchmark with quantum simulator environment for domain-specific metrics feedback and uses human-written code from real programming contests for comparative analysis.

Result: Advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only 18.97% accuracy, while reasoning-based models like o3 reach 78% accuracy, outperforming human-written codes (39.98% average success rate).

Conclusion: The benchmark demonstrates the difficulty of quantum programming tasks and shows reasoning-based approaches are crucial for success in hardware-interactive domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic
programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation
task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic.
However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with
hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python
code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce
QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum
programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers
two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator
environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of
domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error
classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it
incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming
contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of
LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even
advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting
the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3
reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written
codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation
API to support further research.

*Feng Ju,Zeyu Qin,Rui Min,Zhitao He,Lingpeng Kong,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 1PNS (one problem, multiple solutions) training paradigm and Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) metric to increase output diversity in LLMs, showing improved pass@k performance over traditional 1P1S training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning but suffers from low output diversity due to the common "one problem, one solution" (1P1S) training practice that limits reasoning path variety.

Method: Introduce 1PNS training paradigm with Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD) - a step-level metric to measure semantic differences between reasoning chains. Use RPD to curate diverse solution sets and fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base model.

Result: RPD-selected training yields more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with +2.80% average gain in pass@16 over 1P1S baseline and +4.99% gain on AIME24 dataset.

Conclusion: 1PNS training paradigm with RPD metric effectively increases output diversity and amplifies the effectiveness of Test-Time Scaling in LLMs.

Abstract: While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) has proven effective in improving the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs), low diversity in model outputs often
becomes a bottleneck; this is partly caused by the common "one problem, one
solution" (1P1S) training practice, which provides a single canonical answer
and can push models toward a narrow set of reasoning paths. To address this, we
propose a "one problem, multiple solutions" (1PNS) training paradigm that
exposes the model to a variety of valid reasoning trajectories and thus
increases inference diversity. A core challenge for 1PNS is reliably measuring
semantic differences between multi-step chains of thought, so we introduce
Reasoning Path Divergence (RPD), a step-level metric that aligns and scores
Long Chain-of-Thought solutions to capture differences in intermediate
reasoning. Using RPD, we curate maximally diverse solution sets per problem and
fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Base. Experiments show that RPD-selected training yields
more varied outputs and higher pass@k, with an average +2.80% gain in pass@16
over a strong 1P1S baseline and a +4.99% gain on AIME24, demonstrating that
1PNS further amplifies the effectiveness of TTS. Our code is available at

*Nawar Turk,Sevag Kaspar,Leila Kosseim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper uses LLMs to create silver datasets linking persuasion techniques with discourse relations, finding six key discourse relations that play crucial roles in persuasive texts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the relationship between persuasion techniques and discourse relations, as no existing dataset contains both annotations, which could help detect online propaganda and misinformation.

Method: Used SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset with 19 PTs, developed LLM-based classifiers with 4 LLMs and 10 prompts to label discourse relations, created ensemble models with majority-pooling strategies to generate 5 silver datasets.

Result: Created silver datasets (1281-204 instances) showing six discourse relations (Cause, Purpose, Contrast, Cause+Belief, Concession, Condition) are crucial in persuasive texts, especially for Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation, Repetition, and Doubt.

Conclusion: The findings contribute to detecting online propaganda and misinformation, and enhance understanding of effective communication by revealing how discourse relations support persuasion techniques.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between Persuasion Techniques (PTs)
and Discourse Relations (DRs) by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering. Since no dataset annotated with both PTs and DRs exists, we
took the SemEval 2023 Task 3 dataset labelled with 19 PTs as a starting point
and developed LLM-based classifiers to label each instance of the dataset with
one of the 22 PDTB 3.0 level-2 DRs. In total, four LLMs were evaluated using 10
different prompts, resulting in 40 unique DR classifiers. Ensemble models using
different majority-pooling strategies were used to create 5 silver datasets of
instances labelled with both persuasion techniques and level-2 PDTB senses. The
silver dataset sizes vary from 1,281 instances to 204 instances, depending on
the majority pooling technique used. Statistical analysis of these silver
datasets shows that six discourse relations (namely Cause, Purpose, Contrast,
Cause+Belief, Concession, and Condition) play a crucial role in persuasive
texts, especially in the use of Loaded Language, Exaggeration/Minimisation,
Repetition and to cast Doubt. This insight can contribute to detecting online
propaganda and misinformation, as well as to our general understanding of
effective communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially limiting their expressiveness compared to multi-head attention in transformers.

Method: Proposes MossNet with mixture-of-experts implementation in both channel-mixing MLP blocks and time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple 'attention heads' in a recurrent architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments show MossNet outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar size and data budgets. Larger variants trained on trillions of tokens confirm scalability and superior performance with favorable runtime speed and resource usage.

Conclusion: MossNet represents a compelling new direction for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures that can effectively emulate multi-head attention while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced generative
applications in natural language processing (NLP). Recent trends in model
architectures revolve around efficient variants of transformers or
state-space/gated-recurrent models (SSMs, GRMs). However, prevailing
SSM/GRM-based methods often emulate only a single attention head, potentially
limiting their expressiveness. In this work, we propose MossNet, a novel
mixture-of-state-space-experts architecture that emulates a linear multi-head
attention (MHA). MossNet leverages a mixture-of-experts (MoE) implementation
not only in channel-mixing multi-layered perceptron (MLP) blocks but also in
the time-mixing SSM kernels to realize multiple "attention heads." Extensive
experiments on language modeling and downstream evaluations show that MossNet
outperforms both transformer- and SSM-based architectures of similar model size
and data budgets. Larger variants of MossNet, trained on trillions of tokens,
further confirm its scalability and superior performance. In addition,
real-device profiling on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and an Nvidia A100 GPU
demonstrate favorable runtime speed and resource usage compared to similarly
sized baselines. Our results suggest that MossNet is a compelling new direction
for efficient, high-performing recurrent LLM architectures.

TL;DR: SDM language models are fine-tuned sequence prediction models that use a final-layer SDM activation layer for binary classification of instruction-following, improving statistical efficiency by reducing abstentions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the statistical efficiency of language models by reducing abstentions and ensuring more generations fall within well-calibrated, high-probability regions for better instruction-following.

Method: Convert existing pre-trained decoder-only Transformer LMs into SDM LMs via supervised fine-tuning using a final-layer SDM activation layer, contrastive input encoding, and online hard negative example generation.

Result: SDM LMs achieve reduced abstentions compared to strong supervised baselines, demonstrating improved statistical efficiency.

Conclusion: Existing pre-trained LMs can be effectively converted into SDM LMs through the proposed fine-tuning approach, resulting in more reliable instruction-following with fewer abstentions.

Abstract: We introduce Similarity-Distance-Magnitude (SDM) language models (LMs), which
are sequence prediction models fine-tuned to maximize the proportion of
generations in the well-calibrated, high-probability region partitioned by a
final-layer SDM activation layer used for binary classification of
instruction-following. We demonstrate that existing pre-trained decoder-only
Transformer LMs can be readily converted into SDM LMs via supervised
fine-tuning, using the final-layer SDM activation layer during training to
estimate a change-of-base for a supervised next-token loss over a contrastive
input encoding scheme, with additional hard negative examples generated online
during training. This results in reduced abstentions (i.e., improved
statistical efficiency) compared to strong supervised baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RCScore is a framework that quantifies how instruction style affects LLM performance, revealing up to 16.7% accuracy variations across different instruction formulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluations use single instruction templates, ignoring models' sensitivity to instruction style, which is crucial for real-world deployment reliability.

Method: Systematically transform benchmark problems into multiple instruction styles and introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS) to measure stylistic self-consistency.

Result: Experiments across 10 LLMs on 4 reasoning benchmarks show instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7%. CRS strongly correlates with task accuracy, and deterministic decoding produces more stable outputs.

Conclusion: RCScore provides a principled approach to assess instruction robustness, with consistency serving as a valuable proxy for model reliability.

Abstract: Current LLM evaluations often rely on a single instruction template,
overlooking models' sensitivity to instruction style-a critical aspect for
real-world deployments. We present RCScore, a multi-dimensional framework
quantifying how instruction formulation affects model responses. By
systematically transforming benchmark problems into multiple instruction
styles, RCScore reveals performance variations undetected by conventional
metrics. Our experiments across ten LLMs on four reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that instruction style can shift accuracy by up to 16.7% points. We
introduce Cross-Response Similarity (CRS), a method applying RCScore metrics to
measure stylistic self-consistency, and establish its strong correlation with
task accuracy, suggesting consistency as a valuable proxy for model
reliability. Additional findings show that deterministic decoding produces more
stylistically stable outputs, and model scale correlates positively with
cross-style consistency. RCScore offers a principled approach to assess
instruction robustness.

### [28] [Don't Let It Fade: Preserving Edits in Diffusion Language Models via Token Timestep Allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26200)
*Woojin Kim,Jaeyoung Do*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'update forgetting' as a key failure mode in diffusion language models where uniform updates erase earlier edits, and proposes Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) to address this by assigning per-token refinement schedules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the practical controllability issues in diffusion language models, specifically the 'update forgetting' problem where uniform updates disrupt the cumulative refinement process and degrade fluency and coherence.

Method: Proposes Token Timestep Allocation (TTA) which implements soft semantic token ordering through per-token timestep schedules, where critical tokens are frozen early while uncertain tokens continue refinement. This can be implemented as fixed or adaptive policies.

Result: TTA significantly improves controllability and fluency: 20% higher accuracy in sentiment control with nearly halved perplexity using <20% steps; in detoxification, lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 vs 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 vs 32.0).

Conclusion: Softened ordering via timestep allocation is crucial for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable, controllable diffusion text generation.

Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their
practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally
characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform
and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps,
erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement
process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in
uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token
ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and
semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are
frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This
timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an
adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of
refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies
uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision
sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment
control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves
perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers
maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0).
Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep
allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving
stable and controllable diffusion text generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WIMHF is a method that uses sparse autoencoders to automatically extract interpretable features from human feedback data, revealing what preferences datasets can measure and what annotators actually express, enabling better data curation and personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human feedback can unpredictably alter language models, and practitioners lack understanding of what feedback data encodes. Prior work requires pre-specifying attributes, making automatic feature extraction challenging without hypotheses.

Method: WIMHF uses sparse autoencoders to explain feedback data, characterizing both the measurable preferences in datasets and the preferences annotators actually express across 7 different datasets.

Result: WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that account for most preference prediction signal. Features reveal diverse human preferences and context dependence (e.g., Reddit users prefer informality/jokes, while HH-RLHF/PRISM annotators disprefer them). Also surfaces unsafe preferences like LMArena users voting against refusals in favor of toxic content.

Conclusion: WIMHF enables effective data curation (37% safety gains on Arena) and fine-grained personalization through annotator-specific weights. Provides human-centered analysis method for better understanding and using preference data.

Abstract: Human feedback can alter language models in unpredictable and undesirable
ways, as practitioners lack a clear understanding of what feedback data
encodes. While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g.,
length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without
pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human
Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders.
WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring
and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7
datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that
account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by
black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer,
and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer
informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them.
WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users
tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned
features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in
Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance.
They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment
dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that
improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method
for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.

### [30] [Towards Global Retrieval Augmented Generation: A Benchmark for Corpus-Level Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26205)
*Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Tingshuo Fan,Xinchi Chen,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces GlobalQA benchmark for evaluating global RAG capabilities and proposes GlobalRAG framework that achieves significant performance improvement over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG benchmarks focus on local retrieval tasks, but real-world applications require global RAG capabilities that aggregate information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights.

Method: Proposes GlobalRAG - a multi-tool collaborative framework with chunk-level retrieval, LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and aggregation modules for symbolic computation.

Result: Existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks (strongest baseline: 1.51 F1). GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 on Qwen2.5-14B model, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG effectively addresses the limitations of current RAG methods for global tasks and demonstrates substantial performance improvements on the GlobalQA benchmark.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a leading approach to
reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Current RAG evaluation
benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant
chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only
localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world
applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG --
which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document
collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, "What are the top 10
most cited papers in 2023?"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering
four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k
extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and
baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks,
with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these
challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that
preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates
LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates
aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model,
GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1,
validating the effectiveness of our method.

### [31] [Pragmatic Theories Enhance Understanding of Implied Meanings in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26253)
*Takuma Sato,Seiya Kawano,Koichiro Yoshino*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using pragmatic theories (Gricean pragmatics, Relevance Theory) as prompts improves language models' performance on understanding implied meanings by up to 9.6% compared to standard reasoning prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models need to understand implied meanings for effective communication, similar to human language use.

Method: Presenting pragmatic theories as prompts to guide language models through step-by-step reasoning processes for interpreting implied meanings.

Result: Models achieved up to 9.6% higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks compared to 0-shot Chain-of-Thought baseline. Even just mentioning theory names improved performance by 1-3% in larger models.

Conclusion: Providing pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach for enhancing language models' ability to understand implied meanings.

Abstract: The ability to accurately interpret implied meanings plays a crucial role in
human communication and language use, and language models are also expected to
possess this capability. This study demonstrates that providing language models
with pragmatic theories as prompts is an effective in-context learning approach
for tasks to understand implied meanings. Specifically, we propose an approach
in which an overview of pragmatic theories, such as Gricean pragmatics and
Relevance Theory, is presented as a prompt to the language model, guiding it
through a step-by-step reasoning process to derive a final interpretation.
Experimental results showed that, compared to the baseline, which prompts
intermediate reasoning without presenting pragmatic theories (0-shot
Chain-of-Thought), our methods enabled language models to achieve up to 9.6\%
higher scores on pragmatic reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we show that even
without explaining the details of pragmatic theories, merely mentioning their
names in the prompt leads to a certain performance improvement (around 1-3%) in
larger models compared to the baseline.

*Mérilin Sousa Silva,Sina Ahmadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pretrained language models perform poorly at identifying loanwords despite explicit instructions and contextual information, showing bias toward loanwords over native equivalents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether pretrained language models can distinguish loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in bilingual communities where dominant languages impose lexical items on minority languages.

Method: Evaluated multiple pretrained language models (including large language models) across 10 languages using explicit instructions and contextual information for loanword identification.

Result: Models performed poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones, corroborating previous evidence that NLP systems exhibit bias toward loanwords rather than native equivalents.

Conclusion: The findings have implications for developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Abstract: Throughout language history, words are borrowed from one language to another
and gradually become integrated into the recipient's lexicon. Speakers can
often differentiate these loanwords from native vocabulary, particularly in
bilingual communities where a dominant language continuously imposes lexical
items on a minority language. This paper investigates whether pretrained
language models, including large language models, possess similar capabilities
for loanword identification. We evaluate multiple models across 10 languages.
Despite explicit instructions and contextual information, our results show that
models perform poorly in distinguishing loanwords from native ones. These
findings corroborate previous evidence that modern NLP systems exhibit a bias
toward loanwords rather than native equivalents. Our work has implications for
developing NLP tools for minority languages and supporting language
preservation in communities under lexical pressure from dominant languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation shows promise for multilingual vision-language models but has varying effects on cross-lingual consistency and performance stability under model compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models perform unevenly across languages, especially when model size is reduced. Knowledge distillation is under-explored for multilingual applications despite its potential for transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models.

Method: Conducted controlled empirical study of five distillation approaches across CLIP and SigLIP2 models, evaluating effects on cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability during model compression.

Result: Some distillation configurations preserved or improved multilingual retrieval robustness despite halving model size, while others failed to maintain cross-task stability, revealing design-sensitive trade-offs not captured by aggregate accuracy alone.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation for multilingual VLMs requires careful configuration selection as different approaches have varying impacts on cross-lingual consistency and performance stability under compression.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit uneven performance across languages, a
problem that is often exacerbated when the model size is reduced. While
Knowledge distillation (KD) demonstrates promising results in transferring
knowledge from larger to smaller VLMs, applying KD in multilingualism is an
underexplored area. This paper presents a controlled empirical study of KD
behavior across five distillation approaches, isolating their effects on
cross-lingual representation consistency and downstream performance stability
under model compression. We study five distillation formulations across CLIP
and SigLIP2, and evaluate them on in-domain retrieval and out-of-domain visual
QA. We find that some configurations preserve or even improve multilingual
retrieval robustness despite halving model size, but others fail to maintain
cross-task stability, exposing design-sensitive trade-offs that aggregate
accuracy alone does not reveal.

### [34] [Do LLMs Signal When They're Right? Evidence from Neuron Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26277)
*Kang Chen,Yaoning Wang,Kai Xiong,Zhuoka Feng,Wenhe Sun,Haotian Chen,Yixin Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neuron Agreement Decoding (NAD) uses internal neuron activations instead of external signals for ensemble decoding, achieving label-free gains through activation sparsity and cross-sample agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ensemble decoding methods rely on poorly calibrated external signals like token probabilities and self-evaluations, which are limited projections of richer internal dynamics.

Method: NAD analyzes neuron activations to measure sparsity (fewer unique neurons activated for correct responses) and cross-sample agreement (stronger consistency for correct responses), enabling early candidate selection without ground truth.

Result: NAD matches majority voting on math/science benchmarks and outperforms Avg@64 on open-ended coding tasks, while reducing token usage by 99% through early stopping within first 32 tokens.

Conclusion: Internal neuron activations provide reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label-free ensemble decoding, enabling substantial computational savings without quality loss.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly boost reasoning via
sample-evaluate-ensemble decoders, achieving label free gains without ground
truth. However, prevailing strategies score candidates using only external
outputs such as token probabilities, entropies, or self evaluations, and these
signals can be poorly calibrated after post training. We instead analyze
internal behavior based on neuron activations and uncover three findings: (1)
external signals are low dimensional projections of richer internal dynamics;
(2) correct responses activate substantially fewer unique neurons than
incorrect ones throughout generation; and (3) activations from correct
responses exhibit stronger cross sample agreement, whereas incorrect ones
diverge. Motivated by these observations, we propose Neuron Agreement Decoding
(NAD), an unsupervised best-of-N method that selects candidates using
activation sparsity and cross sample neuron agreement, operating solely on
internal signals and without requiring comparable textual outputs. NAD enables
early correctness prediction within the first 32 generated tokens and supports
aggressive early stopping. Across math and science benchmarks with verifiable
answers, NAD matches majority voting; on open ended coding benchmarks where
majority voting is inapplicable, NAD consistently outperforms Avg@64. By
pruning unpromising trajectories early, NAD reduces token usage by 99% with
minimal loss in generation quality, showing that internal signals provide
reliable, scalable, and efficient guidance for label free ensemble decoding.

TL;DR: LLMs learn accurate and universal number representations despite producing numeric errors, enabling universal probes to trace error causes to specific layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the conflict between LLMs' accurate number representations and their propensity for numeric errors, exploring how models manipulate numbers and quantifying accuracy limits.

Method: Analyze how language models manipulate numbers, create universal probes for each LLM, and trace information including error causes to specific layers.

Result: Different LLMs learn interchangeable, systematic, and highly accurate number representations across hidden states and input contexts, despite output errors.

Conclusion: Provides fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outlines potential for more accurate probing techniques to refine LLM architectures.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that different large language models (LLMs) converge to
similar and accurate input embedding representations for numbers. These
findings conflict with the documented propensity of LLMs to produce erroneous
outputs when dealing with numeric information. In this work, we aim to explain
this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify
the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite
surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable
representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal
across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to
create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the
causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental
understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the
potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs'
architectures.

TL;DR: Early evaluation of OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas web interaction capabilities using browser games shows strong performance in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku but significant struggles in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess Atlas's performance in dynamic, interactive web environments, as its capabilities in information retrieval are known but real-time interaction abilities remain unexplored.

Method: Used browser-based games (Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird, Stein.world) as test scenarios and measured performance using in-game scores as quantitative metrics.

Result: Atlas performed strongly in logical reasoning tasks (completing Sudoku puzzles faster than human baselines) but struggled significantly in real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to progress beyond initial obstacles.

Conclusion: While Atlas demonstrates capable analytical processing, it has notable limitations in dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction, highlighting the gap between analytical and motor control capabilities.

Abstract: OpenAI's ChatGPT Atlas introduces new capabilities for web interaction,
enabling the model to analyze webpages, process user intents, and execute
cursor and keyboard inputs directly within the browser. While its capacity for
information retrieval tasks has been demonstrated, its performance in dynamic,
interactive environments remains less explored. In this study, we conduct an
early evaluation of Atlas's web interaction capabilities using browser-based
games as test scenarios, including Google's T-Rex Runner, Sudoku, Flappy Bird,
and Stein.world. We employ in-game performance scores as quantitative metrics
to assess performance across different task types. Our results show that Atlas
performs strongly in logical reasoning tasks like Sudoku, completing puzzles
significantly faster than human baselines, but struggles substantially in
real-time games requiring precise timing and motor control, often failing to
progress beyond initial obstacles. These findings suggest that while Atlas
demonstrates capable analytical processing, there remain notable limitations in
dynamic web environments requiring real-time interaction. The website of our

TL;DR: SCRIBE is a framework for generating pedagogically valid student feedback using small language models with tool-augmented reasoning, achieving comparable quality to much larger models while enabling privacy-sensitive educational applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployment of language models in education faces privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need for pedagogically valid responses, requiring small models that can run locally and ground outputs in correct information.

Method: SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective inference pipeline supporting iterative reasoning, tool use, and error recovery. Models are distilled into 3B and 8B versions via two-stage LoRA fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data.

Result: Evaluation shows 8B-SCRIBE models achieve comparable or superior quality to larger models in relevance and actionability, and are perceived on par with GPT-4o and Llama-3.3 70B by students in user studies with 108 participants.

Conclusion: SCRIBE demonstrates viability for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications by enabling small models to generate high-quality, pedagogically valid feedback comparable to much larger models.

Abstract: Language models can be used to provide interactive, personalized student
feedback in educational settings. However, real-world deployment faces three
key challenges: privacy concerns, limited computational resources, and the need
for pedagogically valid responses. These constraints require small, open-source
models that can run locally and reliably ground their outputs in correct
information. We introduce SCRIBE, a framework for multi-hop, tool-augmented
reasoning designed to generate valid responses to student questions about
feedback reports. SCRIBE combines domain-specific tools with a self-reflective
inference pipeline that supports iterative reasoning, tool use, and error
recovery. We distil these capabilities into 3B and 8B models via two-stage LoRA
fine-tuning on synthetic GPT-4o-generated data. Evaluation with a human-aligned
GPT-Judge and a user study with 108 students shows that 8B-SCRIBE models
achieve comparable or superior quality to much larger models in key dimensions
such as relevance and actionability, while being perceived on par with GPT-4o
and Llama-3.3 70B by students. These findings demonstrate the viability of
SCRIBE for low-resource, privacy-sensitive educational applications.

TL;DR: ACER transforms general LLMs into domain experts through automated curriculum generation and continual pretraining, achieving significant performance gains in specialized domains while maintaining general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs underperform in specialized domains requiring deep understanding, creating a need for methods that can enhance domain expertise without sacrificing general capabilities.

Method: ACER synthesizes textbook-style curricula by generating tables of contents and Bloom's taxonomy-guided QA pairs, then uses continual pretraining with interleaved curriculum scheduling across content and cognitive dimensions.

Result: ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points in challenging domains like microeconomics, achieves 3 percentage point macro-average improvement across target domains, and enables positive cross-domain knowledge transfer (+0.7 points). Also improves ARC and GPQA benchmarks by over 2 points while maintaining general reasoning performance.

Conclusion: ACER provides a scalable and effective approach for closing domain gaps in LLMs, preventing catastrophic forgetting and facilitating knowledge transfer across domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general tasks but underperform in
specialized domains like economics and psychology, which require deep,
principled understanding. To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated
Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain
experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a
comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for
a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's
taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing
difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining
with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content
and cognitive dimensions.
  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized
MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines
struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target
domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage
points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also
facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on
non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on
knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points,
while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ACER offers a scalable and effective recipe for closing
critical domain gaps in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health-related misinformation is prevalent and harmful, especially when it distorts scientific findings, making it difficult to identify automatically.

Method: Proposed MisSynth pipeline applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to create synthetic fallacy samples, then fine-tunes LLMs using this synthetic data.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed substantial accuracy gains - LLaMA 3.1 8B achieved over 35% absolute F1-score improvement on MISSCI test split compared to vanilla baseline.

Conclusion: Synthetic fallacy data augmentation significantly enhances zero-shot LLM classification performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited computational resources.

Abstract: Health-related misinformation is very prevalent and potentially harmful. It
is difficult to identify, especially when claims distort or misinterpret
scientific findings. We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and
lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and
framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples,
which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial
accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For
instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score
absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We
demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited
annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification
performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited
computational resources. The code and synthetic dataset are available on

TL;DR: Proposes an interaction-centric framework for automatic LLM team composition using semantic coherence from pairwise conversations to form synergistic teams without requiring prior knowledge of model internals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent LLM approaches show promise but require optimal team composition, which is challenging due to model opacity that hides internal characteristics needed for effective collaboration.

Method: Constructs a 'language model graph' mapping relationships from pairwise conversation semantic coherence, then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters without needing model architecture, training data, or performance knowledge.

Result: Method discovers functionally coherent groups reflecting latent specializations; topic-primed conversations identified synergistic teams outperforming random baselines and achieving comparable accuracy to manually-curated teams.

Conclusion: Provides a new basis for automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams through interaction-centric team composition.

Abstract: While a multi-agent approach based on large language models (LLMs) represents
a promising strategy to surpass the capabilities of single models, its success
is critically dependent on synergistic team composition. However, forming
optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most
models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective
collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for
automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including
their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method
constructs a "language model graph" that maps relationships between models from
the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community
detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse
LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent
groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with
specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines
on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of
manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings
provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM
teams.

Motivation: To support AI-generated scientific claims by using discourse-level information, with discourse structure inference as a first step towards finding supporting evidence.

Method: Uses pretrained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) for discourse relation classification, examining how context defined by discourse structure affects performance.

Result: Context from discourse structure is generally helpful for discourse relation classification, with analysis showing which scientific discourse relation types benefit most from context.

Conclusion: Discourse structure context improves discourse relation classification in scientific writing, providing insights for supporting AI-generated scientific claims.

Abstract: With the increasing use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to

Classification (DRC), focusing on scientific publications, an under-studied

TL;DR: OmniEduBench is a comprehensive Chinese educational benchmark with 24.6K question-answer pairs covering knowledge and cultivation dimensions across 61 subjects, revealing significant performance gaps between LLMs and human intelligence in educational applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs and benchmarks focus mainly on knowledge evaluation while neglecting cultivation capabilities essential for real-world education, particularly in the Chinese context where current benchmarks lack diversity.

Method: Created OmniEduBench with 24.6K high-quality QA pairs divided into knowledge (18.1K) and cultivation (6.5K) dimensions, each with 6 categories covering 61 subjects and 11 question formats. Evaluated 11 mainstream LLMs.

Result: Significant performance gaps: only Gemini-2.5 Pro exceeded 60% accuracy in knowledge dimension, while best model (QWQ) in cultivation dimension trailed human intelligence by nearly 30%.

Conclusion: LLMs have substantial room for improvement in educational applications, particularly in cultivation capabilities, highlighting the challenges of applying current models effectively in education.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), various LLM-based
works have been widely applied in educational fields. However, most existing
LLMs and their benchmarks focus primarily on the knowledge dimension, largely
neglecting the evaluation of cultivation capabilities that are essential for
real-world educational scenarios. Additionally, current benchmarks are often
limited to a single subject or question type, lacking sufficient diversity.
This issue is particularly prominent within the Chinese context. To address
this gap, we introduce OmniEduBench, a comprehensive Chinese educational
benchmark. OmniEduBench consists of 24.602K high-quality question-answer pairs.
The data is meticulously divided into two core dimensions: the knowledge
dimension and the cultivation dimension, which contain 18.121K and 6.481K
entries, respectively. Each dimension is further subdivided into 6 fine-grained
categories, covering a total of 61 different subjects (41 in the knowledge and
20 in the cultivation). Furthermore, the dataset features a rich variety of
question formats, including 11 common exam question types, providing a solid
foundation for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' capabilities in education.
Extensive experiments on 11 mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs
reveal a clear performance gap. In the knowledge dimension, only Gemini-2.5 Pro
surpassed 60\% accuracy, while in the cultivation dimension, the
best-performing model, QWQ, still trailed human intelligence by nearly 30\%.
These results highlight the substantial room for improvement and underscore the
challenges of applying LLMs in education.

Motivation: LLMs face deployment challenges due to high bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning and low-rank methods work individually, their combined potential remains unexplored for more efficient compression.

Method: Formulates low-rank approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem solved through iterative optimization, synergistically retaining essential structure while eliminating non-essential weights.

Result: SSLC consistently outperforms standalone methods on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models (7B-70B), achieving state-of-the-art compression with 50% size reduction on Qwen2.5 and at least 1.63× speedup.

Conclusion: SSLC provides a practical solution for efficient LLM deployment by synergistically combining sparse and low-rank compression without requiring additional training steps.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
language comprehension and generation; however, their widespread adoption is
constrained by substantial bandwidth and computational demands. While pruning
and low-rank approximation have each demonstrated promising performance
individually, their synergy for LLMs remains underexplored. We introduce
\underline{S}ynergistic \underline{S}parse and \underline{L}ow-Rank
\underline{C}ompression (SSLC) methods for LLMs, which leverages the strengths
of both techniques: low-rank approximation compresses the model by retaining
its essential structure with minimal information loss, whereas sparse
optimization eliminates non-essential weights, preserving those crucial for
generalization. Based on theoretical analysis, we first formulate the low-rank
approximation and sparse optimization as a unified problem and solve it by
iterative optimization algorithm. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen2.5 models
(7B-70B) show that SSLC, without any additional training steps, consistently
surpasses standalone methods, achieving state-of-the-arts results. Notably,
SSLC compresses Qwen2.5 by 50\% with no performance drop and achieves at least
1.63$\times$ speedup, offering a practical solution for efficient LLM
deployment.

### [44] [Bayesian Network Fusion of Large Language Models for Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26484)
*Rasoul Amirzadeh,Dhananjay Thiruvady,Fatemeh Shiri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BNLF framework integrates multiple LLMs using Bayesian networks for sentiment analysis, achieving ~6% accuracy improvement over baseline models while providing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of domain-specific LLMs including lack of transparency, high fine-tuning costs, prompt engineering requirements, inconsistent results across domains, and environmental impact from computational demands.

Method: Bayesian network LLM fusion (BNLF) integrates predictions from FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet through probabilistic late fusion, modeling sentiment predictions as probabilistic nodes in a Bayesian network.

Result: Evaluated on three human-annotated financial corpora, BNLF demonstrated consistent gains of about 6% in accuracy over baseline LLMs, showing robustness to dataset variability.

Conclusion: Probabilistic fusion through Bayesian networks is effective for interpretable sentiment classification, providing consistent performance improvements across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, with an increasing number
of domain-specific variants tailored for specialised tasks. However, these
models often lack transparency and explainability, can be costly to fine-tune,
require substantial prompt engineering, yield inconsistent results across
domains, and impose significant adverse environmental impact due to their high
computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Bayesian
network LLM fusion (BNLF) framework, which integrates predictions from three
LLMs, including FinBERT, RoBERTa, and BERTweet, through a probabilistic
mechanism for sentiment analysis. BNLF performs late fusion by modelling the
sentiment predictions from multiple LLMs as probabilistic nodes within a
Bayesian network. Evaluated across three human-annotated financial corpora with
distinct linguistic and contextual characteristics, BNLF demonstrates
consistent gains of about six percent in accuracy over the baseline LLMs,
underscoring its robustness to dataset variability and the effectiveness of
probabilistic fusion for interpretable sentiment classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An ensemble of multiple LLM agents provides more reliable assessment of AI triage tools than single LLMs, with open-source models performing comparably to GPT-4o.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if an ensemble of multiple LLM agents could provide more reliable assessment of pixel-based AI triage tools than single LLMs alone.

Method: Analyzed 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams using 8 open-source LLM models and GPT-4o with multi-shot prompts to assess intracranial hemorrhage presence. Compared performance of individual models and consensus ensembles.

Result: Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o achieved highest AUC (0.78). Ensemble methods (Full-9, Top-3, Consensus) showed better Matthews Correlation Coefficient than GPT-4o alone, with no significant differences between ensemble types.

Conclusion: Ensemble of medium to large open-source LLMs provides more consistent and reliable ground truth evaluation of clinical AI triage tools than single LLMs.

Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if an ensemble of
multiple LLM agents could be used collectively to provide a more reliable
assessment of a pixel-based AI triage tool than a single LLM.
  Methods: 29,766 non-contrast CT head exams from fourteen hospitals were
processed by a commercial intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) AI detection tool.
Radiology reports were analyzed by an ensemble of eight open-source LLM models
and a HIPAA compliant internal version of GPT-4o using a single multi-shot
prompt that assessed for presence of ICH. 1,726 examples were manually
reviewed. Performance characteristics of the eight open-source models and
consensus were compared to GPT-4o. Three ideal consensus LLM ensembles were
tested for rating the performance of the triage tool.
  Results: The cohort consisted of 29,766 head CTs exam-report pairs. The
highest AUC performance was achieved with llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AUC= 0.78).
The average precision was highest for Llama3.3:70b and GPT-4o (AP=0.75 & 0.76).
Llama3.3:70b had the highest F1 score (0.81) and recall (0.85), greater
precision (0.78), specificity (0.72), and MCC (0.57). Using MCC (95% CI) the
ideal combination of LLMs were: Full-9 Ensemble 0.571 (0.552-0.591), Top-3
Ensemble 0.558 (0.537-0.579), Consensus 0.556 (0.539-0.574), and GPT4o 0.522
(0.500-0.543). No statistically significant differences were observed between
Top-3, Full-9, and Consensus (p > 0.05).
  Conclusion: An ensemble of medium to large sized open-source LLMs provides a
more consistent and reliable method to derive a ground truth retrospective
evaluation of a clinical AI triage tool over a single LLM alone.

### [46] [Inside CORE-KG: Evaluating Structured Prompting and Coreference Resolution for Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26512)
*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CORE-KG framework reduces node duplication and noise in legal knowledge graphs by integrating coreference resolution and structured prompts, with ablation study showing structured prompts are more critical for noise reduction while coreference resolution better handles duplication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human smuggling case documents are unstructured and lexically dense, making automated KG construction challenging. Existing LLM approaches produce noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to lack of guided extraction and coreference resolution.

Method: Systematic ablation study of CORE-KG framework to quantify contributions of its two key components: type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts.

Result: Removing coreference resolution caused 28.32% increase in node duplication and 4.32% increase in noisy nodes. Removing structured prompts caused 4.34% increase in duplication and 73.33% increase in noisy nodes.

Conclusion: Structured prompts are more effective for reducing noise while coreference resolution better handles duplication, providing empirical insights for designing robust LLM-based extraction pipelines for complex legal texts.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are increasingly adaptive and difficult to analyze.
Legal case documents offer critical insights but are often unstructured,
lexically dense, and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, which pose
significant challenges for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. While
recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate
noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided
extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework
addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and
domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and
legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to
quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results
show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node
duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured
prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in
noisy nodes. These findings offer empirical insights for designing robust
LLM-based pipelines for extracting structured representations from complex
legal texts.

*Yair Elboher,Yuval Pinter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DIVRIT is a novel Hebrew diacritization system that frames the task as zero-shot classification using a Hebrew Visual Language Model to process undiacritized text as images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hebrew diacritics restoration is crucial for accurate pronunciation and meaning disambiguation, but the language has high ambiguity when unvocalized. Recent ML approaches have advanced performance, but there's need for more effective methods.

Method: Frames diacritization as zero-shot classification at word level, selecting diacritization patterns from dynamically generated candidate sets conditioned on context. Uses Hebrew Visual Language Model to process undiacritized text as images, embedding diacritic information directly in vector representations.

Result: System effectively performs diacritization without complex linguistic analysis. In oracle setting with correct form guaranteed among candidates, achieves high accuracy. Architectural enhancements and optimized training yield significant improvements in generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Visual representations show promising potential for accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization, highlighting the effectiveness of the DIVRIT approach.

Abstract: Diacritics restoration in Hebrew is a fundamental task for ensuring accurate
word pronunciation and disambiguating textual meaning. Despite the language's
high degree of ambiguity when unvocalized, recent machine learning approaches
have significantly advanced performance on this task.
  In this work, we present DIVRIT, a novel system for Hebrew diacritization
that frames the task as a zero-shot classification problem. Our approach
operates at the word level, selecting the most appropriate diacritization
pattern for each undiacritized word from a dynamically generated candidate set,
conditioned on the surrounding textual context. A key innovation of DIVRIT is
its use of a Hebrew Visual Language Model, which processes undiacritized text
as an image, allowing diacritic information to be embedded directly within the
input's vector representation.
  Through a comprehensive evaluation across various configurations, we
demonstrate that the system effectively performs diacritization without relying
on complex, explicit linguistic analysis. Notably, in an ``oracle'' setting
where the correct diacritized form is guaranteed to be among the provided
candidates, DIVRIT achieves a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, strategic
architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies yield
significant improvements in the system's overall generalization capabilities.
These findings highlight the promising potential of visual representations for
accurate and automated Hebrew diacritization.

### [48] [The Structure of Relation Decoding Linear Operators in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26543)
*Miranda Anna Christ,Adrián Csiszárik,Gergely Becsó,Dániel Varga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Linear relational decoders in transformers are highly compressible and extract coarse-grained semantic properties rather than distinct relations, explaining their generalization patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the organization and structure of linear operators that decode relational facts in transformer language models, extending from single-relation analysis to collections of relations.

Method: Extend single-relation findings to multiple relations, use tensor networks for compression analysis, and develop cross-evaluation protocol to test decoders across different relations.

Result: Relation decoders can be highly compressed without accuracy loss, and they extract recurring semantic properties rather than distinct relations, explaining their compressibility and generalization patterns.

Conclusion: Linear relational decoding in transformers is primarily property-based rather than relation-specific, with decoders extracting coarse-grained semantic properties that explain both compressibility and limited generalization.

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in
Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer
language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of
relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such
collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3
tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this
surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we
apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our
results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but
extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital
city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This
property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and
highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically
close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer
language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.

### [49] [InfoFlow: Reinforcing Search Agent Via Reward Density Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26575)
*Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu,Ziyi Xia,Shitao Xiao,Siqi Bao,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoFlow addresses the low reward density problem in RLVR by decomposing tasks, providing failure-guided hints, and using dual-agent refinement to improve exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR faces challenges with low reward density in deep search scenarios, where agents spend high exploration costs for infrequent rewards.

Method: InfoFlow uses subproblem decomposition, failure-guided hints, and dual-agent refinement to increase reward density and reduce exploration costs.

Result: InfoFlow outperforms strong baselines on agentic search benchmarks, enabling lightweight LLMs to match performance of advanced proprietary LLMs.

Conclusion: InfoFlow effectively solves the reward density optimization problem in RLVR, making deep search more efficient and accessible.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for enhancing agentic deep search. However, its application is often hindered
by low \textbf{Reward Density} in deep search scenarios, where agents expend
significant exploratory costs for infrequent and often null final rewards. In
this paper, we formalize this challenge as the \textbf{Reward Density
Optimization} problem, which aims to improve the reward obtained per unit of
exploration cost. This paper introduce \textbf{InfoFlow}, a systematic
framework that tackles this problem from three aspects. 1) \textbf{Subproblem
decomposition}: breaking down long-range tasks to assign process rewards,
thereby providing denser learning signals. 2) \textbf{Failure-guided hints}:
injecting corrective guidance into stalled trajectories to increase the
probability of successful outcomes. 3) \textbf{Dual-agent refinement}:
employing a dual-agent architecture to offload the cognitive burden of deep
exploration. A refiner agent synthesizes the search history, which effectively
compresses the researcher's perceived trajectory, thereby reducing exploration
cost and increasing the overall reward density. We evaluate InfoFlow on
multiple agentic search benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms strong
baselines, enabling lightweight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to
advanced proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: CAST is a dynamic tree decoding method that optimizes speculative decoding by considering GPU configurations and batch sizes, achieving up to 5.2x speedup over conventional methods and outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by 5-20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address LLM inference latency challenges from autoregressive design and large model size, while existing speculative decoding approaches neglect system variables like GPU devices and batch sizes.

Method: Dynamic tree decoding approach that considers inference costs including GPU configurations and batch sizes to dynamically refine the tree structure.

Result: Achieves speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods and generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques by 5% to 20% across six diverse tasks using six distinct LLMs.

Conclusion: CAST effectively addresses LLM inference latency by incorporating system-level considerations into speculative decoding, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant inference latency challenges
stemming from their autoregressive design and large size. To address this,
speculative decoding emerges as a solution, enabling the simultaneous
generation and validation of multiple tokens. While recent approaches like
EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 improve speculative decoding using dynamic tree structures,
they often neglect the impact of crucial system variables such as GPU devices
and batch sizes.
  Therefore, we introduce a new dynamic tree decoding approach called CAST that
takes into account inference costs, including factors such as GPU
configurations and batch sizes, to dynamically refine the tree structure.
Through comprehensive experimentation across six diverse tasks and utilizing
six distinct LLMs, our methodology demonstrates remarkable results, achieving
speeds up to 5.2 times faster than conventional decoding methods. Moreover, it
generally outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques from 5% to 20%.

TL;DR: SlideAgent is an agentic framework that improves multi-page visual document understanding through specialized agents working at global, page, and element levels, achieving significant performance gains over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems struggle with complex multi-page visual documents that require fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages, particularly for documents like slide decks that convey information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide references.

Method: SlideAgent employs specialized agents that decompose reasoning into three levels (global, page, and element) to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation. During inference, it selectively activates these agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs.

Result: Extensive experiments show SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

Conclusion: SlideAgent provides an effective framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, particularly slide decks, by leveraging specialized agents and multi-level reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and
posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide
references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document
understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual
documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We
introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding
multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks.
SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three
specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured,
query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and
detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively
activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their
outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that
SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9
overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

*Biao Zhang,Yong Cheng,Siamak Shakeri,Xinyi Wang,Min Ma,Orhan Firat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper revisits encoder-decoder LLMs (RedLLM) enhanced with modern techniques from decoder-only LLMs, showing they have compelling scaling properties and strong performance despite the current dominance of decoder-only architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid shift from encoder-decoder to decoder-only LLM architectures occurred without rigorous comparative analysis from a scaling perspective, potentially overlooking the potential of encoder-decoder models.

Method: Enhanced encoder-decoder LLMs (RedLLM) with recent decoder-only recipes, pretrained with prefix language modeling, and compared them against decoder-only LLMs (DecLLM) pretrained with causal LM across scales from ~150M to ~8B parameters using RedPajama V1 data.

Result: RedLLM shows compelling scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling and context length extrapolation, and achieves comparable or better results on downstream tasks after instruction tuning with substantially better inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Encoder-decoder LLMs deserve re-examination as they show strong potential for developing powerful and efficient LLMs, with better inference efficiency after instruction tuning.

Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) research has undergone an architectural
shift from encoder-decoder modeling to nowadays the dominant decoder-only
modeling. This rapid transition, however, comes without a rigorous comparative
analysis especially \textit{from the scaling perspective}, raising concerns
that the potential of encoder-decoder models may have been overlooked. To fill
this gap, we revisit encoder-decoder LLM (RedLLM), enhancing it with recent
recipes from decoder-only LLM (DecLLM). We conduct a comprehensive comparison
between RedLLM, pretrained with prefix language modeling (LM), and DecLLM,
pretrained with causal LM, at different model scales, ranging from $\sim$150M
to $\sim$8B. Using RedPajama V1 (1.6T tokens) for pretraining and FLAN for
instruction tuning, our experiments show that RedLLM produces compelling
scaling properties and surprisingly strong performance. While DecLLM is overall
more compute-optimal during pretraining, RedLLM demonstrates comparable scaling
and context length extrapolation capabilities. After instruction tuning, RedLLM
achieves comparable and even better results on various downstream tasks while
enjoying substantially better inference efficiency. We hope our findings could
inspire more efforts on re-examining RedLLM, unlocking its potential for
developing powerful and efficient LLMs.

TL;DR: Evontree is a framework that uses ontology rules to extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge in LLMs without extensive external datasets, achieving up to 3.7% accuracy improvement in medical QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in data-sensitive domains like healthcare due to lack of high-quality domain-specific training data, while domain experts have created valuable ontology rules that formalize concept relationships.

Method: Extracts domain ontology from raw LLMs, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces refined knowledge through self-distilled fine-tuning.

Result: Outperforms both unmodified models and supervised baselines on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2, achieving up to 3.7% accuracy improvement.

Conclusion: The approach is effective, efficient, and robust for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs, leveraging existing ontology rules rather than requiring extensive external datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities
across multiple domains by leveraging massive pre-training and curated
fine-tuning data. However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the
lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation
for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain
wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and
ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as
implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel
framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to
systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs,
without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts
domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core
ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled
fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both
unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7%
improvement in accuracy. These results confirm the effectiveness, efficiency,
and robustness of our approach for low-resource domain adaptation of LLMs.

TL;DR: Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention across various scenarios while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving 6x decoding throughput for 1M context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a linear attention architecture that can outperform full attention while being more efficient, particularly for long-context scenarios and reinforcement learning applications.

Method: Uses Kimi Delta Attention (KDA) with finer-grained gating mechanism and bespoke chunkwise algorithm with specialized DPLR transition matrices. Combines KDA with Multi-Head Latent Attention in a layerwise hybrid architecture.

Result: 3B parameter model outperforms full MLA across all evaluated tasks, reduces KV cache by 75%, achieves 6x decoding throughput for 1M context, and maintains performance for longer input/output lengths.

Conclusion: Kimi Linear serves as a drop-in replacement for full attention with superior performance and efficiency, with open-source implementations and model checkpoints released.

Abstract: We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for
the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoDeco enables truly end-to-end LLM generation by learning to control its own decoding parameters (temperature and top-p) dynamically during generation, eliminating the need for manual hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs are not truly end-to-end because they rely on non-differentiable decoding processes that require manual hyperparameter tuning, which is laborious and suboptimal.

Method: Augment standard transformer with lightweight heads that dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside next-token logits at each generation step.

Result: AutoDeco significantly outperforms default decoding strategies and achieves performance comparable to oracle-tuned baselines across eight benchmarks. It also demonstrates emergent instruction-based decoding control.

Conclusion: AutoDeco opens a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding by enabling models to self-regulate sampling strategies and respond to natural language commands for decoding control.

Abstract: The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a
non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of
hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a
novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to
control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with
lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific
temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach
transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model
to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.
  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that
AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but
also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from
"hacking the test set"-a practical upper bound for any static method.
Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding
control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g.,
"generate with low randomness") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p
on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive
LLM decoding.

### [56] [Value Drifts: Tracing Value Alignment During LLM Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26707)
*Mehar Bhatia,Shravan Nayak,Gaurav Kamath,Marius Mosbach,Karolina Stańczak,Vered Shwartz,Siva Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates when and how value alignment emerges during LLM post-training, finding that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily establishes model values while preference optimization rarely re-aligns them, with different algorithms yielding different alignment outcomes even with identical preference data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more socially important, understanding how they learn human value alignment during training is crucial, but prior work mostly evaluated fully trained models without examining training dynamics.

Method: Analyzed value alignment dynamics during post-training using Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of various sizes, testing SFT and preference optimization datasets/algorithms, plus controlled experiments with synthetic preference data.

Result: SFT phase generally establishes model values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these values; different preference optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes even with identical preference data.

Conclusion: The findings provide actionable insights for data curation and algorithm selection to improve model alignment with human values, emphasizing the critical role of SFT in value establishment.

Abstract: As LLMs occupy an increasingly important role in society, they are more and
more confronted with questions that require them not only to draw on their
general knowledge but also to align with certain human value systems.
Therefore, studying the alignment of LLMs with human values has become a
crucial field of inquiry. Prior work, however, mostly focuses on evaluating the
alignment of fully trained models, overlooking the training dynamics by which
models learn to express human values. In this work, we investigate how and at
which stage value alignment arises during the course of a model's
post-training. Our analysis disentangles the effects of post-training
algorithms and datasets, measuring both the magnitude and time of value drifts
during training. Experimenting with Llama-3 and Qwen-3 models of different
sizes and popular supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and preference optimization
datasets and algorithms, we find that the SFT phase generally establishes a
model's values, and subsequent preference optimization rarely re-aligns these
values. Furthermore, using a synthetic preference dataset that enables
controlled manipulation of values, we find that different preference
optimization algorithms lead to different value alignment outcomes, even when
preference data is held constant. Our findings provide actionable insights into
how values are learned during post-training and help to inform data curation,
as well as the selection of models and algorithms for preference optimization
to improve model alignment to human values.

*Shengnan An,Xunliang Cai,Xuezhi Cao,Xiaoyu Li,Yehao Lin,Junlin Liu,Xinxuan Lv,Dan Ma,Xuanlin Wang,Ziwen Wang,Shuang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMO-Bench is a new benchmark with 50 original, expert-validated math problems at IMO difficulty level or higher, designed to address performance saturation in existing benchmarks and prevent data memorization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing math benchmarks are becoming less effective for evaluating top LLMs due to performance saturation, and there's a need for more rigorous challenges that prevent data leakage through memorization.

Method: Created 50 human-crafted problems cross-validated by experts to meet IMO difficulty standards, all original to prevent memorization, with final-answer format for automatic grading.

Result: Even the best-performing LLM achieved only 52.4% accuracy, with most models scoring below 40%, showing significant room for improvement in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: AMO-Bench provides a challenging benchmark that reveals current limitations in LLMs' mathematical reasoning and shows promising scaling trends with increased compute, facilitating future research in this area.

Abstract: We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with
Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems.
Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for
evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for
assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To
address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50
problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original
problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization.
Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a
proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental
results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model
achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.
Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising
scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results
highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in
current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into
advancing the reasoning abilities of language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Gistify is a task where coding LLMs must create minimal, self-contained files that reproduce specific functionalities from large codebases, requiring structural understanding and execution flow modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, there is a need for automated, challenging codebase-level evaluation to test their capabilities.

Method: Given full access to a codebase and a specific entrypoint, the LLM must generate a single file that replicates the output of running the same command in the full codebase, containing only essential components.

Result: Current state-of-the-art models struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially those with long execution traces.

Conclusion: Gistify presents a challenging evaluation benchmark that reveals limitations in current coding LLMs' ability to understand codebase structure and execution flow.

Abstract: As coding agents are increasingly deployed in large codebases, the need to
automatically design challenging, codebase-level evaluation is central. We
propose Gistify, a task where a coding LLM must create a single, minimal,
self-contained file that can reproduce a specific functionality of a codebase.
The coding LLM is given full access to a codebase along with a specific
entrypoint (e.g., a python command), and the generated file must replicate the
output of the same command ran under the full codebase, while containing only
the essential components necessary to execute the provided command. Success on
Gistify requires both structural understanding of the codebase, accurate
modeling of its execution flow as well as the ability to produce potentially
large code patches. Our findings show that current state-of-the-art models
struggle to reliably solve Gistify tasks, especially ones with long executions
traces.

*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates spatio-temporal modeling and spatial attention mechanisms in underwater object detection, comparing YOLOv5, T-YOLOv5, and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy for complex marine environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve underwater object detection accuracy in dynamic marine environments with challenges like sudden movements, partial occlusions, and gradual motion by leveraging temporal modeling and attention mechanisms.

Method: Two-phase approach: first evaluating T-YOLOv5 (temporal-enhanced YOLOv5) vs standard YOLOv5, then developing T-YOLOv5 with CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) to enhance spatial attention capabilities.

Result: T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM significantly outperformed standard YOLOv5, achieving mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811 respectively, compared to 0.563 for YOLOv5. T-YOLOv5 with CBAM showed better performance in challenging scenarios but had slight accuracy loss in simpler cases.

Conclusion: Temporal modeling significantly enhances underwater object detection reliability, and the addition of CBAM further improves performance in complex scenarios, though with trade-offs in simpler detection tasks.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRO conditions text-to-image models on multiple reward models during training to directly learn user preferences, improving visual quality and training efficiency while maintaining diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models trained on uncurated datasets don't align well with user preferences. Post-hoc reward selection methods discard data and harm diversity, semantic fidelity, and efficiency.

Method: Instead of post-processing, MIRO conditions the model on multiple reward models during training to directly learn user preferences.

Result: MIRO dramatically improves visual quality, significantly speeds up training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval benchmark and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

Conclusion: Directly conditioning on multiple reward models during training is more effective than post-hoc selection for aligning text-to-image generation with user preferences.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Machine learning approach for STM image repair and super-resolution using physics-informed synthetic data, enabling 2-4x faster image acquisition and reduced tip conditioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STM limitations include tip degradation requiring frequent conditioning and slow serial data acquisition, which limits experimental throughput.

Method: Used physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline with only 36 pristine experimental images to train flow-matching and diffusion models for image restoration and super-resolution.

Result: Models effectively restored images and achieved 2-4x reduction in image acquisition time by accurately reconstructing from sparsely sampled data, validated by CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy and structural similarity metrics.

Conclusion: The framework can significantly increase STM experimental throughput by reducing tip-conditioning frequency and enhancing frame rates in high-speed STM systems.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [63] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework for image editing that semantically decomposes target prompts into sub-prompts, computes independent flows for each, and aggregates them with adaptive weighting to preserve diversity and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow models have limitations in image editing tasks including inaccurate inversion processes and gradient entanglement issues that result in outputs not faithfully reflecting target prompts. Existing ODE-based approaches without inversion still yield suboptimal editing quality.

Method: Semantically decomposes target prompt into multiple sub-prompts, computes independent flow for each, and aggregates them using projection and soft-aggregation mechanism inspired by gradient conflict resolution in multi-task learning. This adaptively weights sub-target velocity fields to suppress semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct directions.

Result: Experimental results show the method outperforms existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement.

Conclusion: The proposed flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework effectively addresses limitations of rectified flow models in image editing by preserving both diversity and consistency in edited outputs through semantic decomposition and adaptive aggregation.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at

### [64] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Brain-IT is a brain-inspired approach using Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) to reconstruct images from fMRI data with improved faithfulness by enabling interactions between functionally-similar brain-voxel clusters and predicting complementary patch-level image features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for reconstructing images from fMRI brain recordings often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images, despite recent progress with diffusion models.

Method: Uses Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) with functional clusters of brain-voxels shared across subjects. Predicts two complementary patch-level image features: high-level semantic features for correct semantic content and low-level structural features for correct coarse layout. All model components are shared across clusters and subjects.

Result: Achieves faithful image reconstructions from fMRI that surpass current state-of-the-art approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. With only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, achieves comparable results to methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Conclusion: Brain-IT's brain-inspired approach with functional clusters and direct information flow enables more faithful image reconstruction from fMRI data with significantly reduced training data requirements.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper presents a real-time tumor tracking method using SAM 2.1 foundation model with mask-based prompts, achieving 0.8794 Dice score in TrackRAD2025 challenge under data scarcity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the TrackRAD2025 challenge for real-time tumor tracking in cine-MRI sequences under strong data scarcity constraints in thoracic and abdominal regions.

Method: Used SAM 2.1 foundation model with mask-based prompts from first annotated slice, fine-tuned on small labeled dataset. Applied low uniform learning rate (0.0001) to all modules, trained for 300 epochs with balanced Dice + IoU loss.

Result: Achieved Dice score of 0.8794 on hidden test set, ranking 6th overall in TrackRAD2025 challenge. The method met real-time constraints with one-second runtime.

Conclusion: Foundation models show strong potential for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy, demonstrating effectiveness even under data scarcity conditions.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

TL;DR: Enhanced Mamba framework with Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism increases Hausdorff dimension of scanning pattern, improving feature space exploration and fine-scale detail capture while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information inconsistencies in existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods and improve spatial locality while maintaining long-range dependency handling.

Method: Proposed Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism that increases the Hausdorff dimension of Mamba's scanning pattern, enabling more effective feature space exploration and better capture of fine-scale details.

Result: Significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity on publicly available benchmarks, with reduced computational resource consumption and shorter inference time.

Conclusion: The refined strategy advances state-of-the-art in low-light image enhancement and shows promise for broader applications in Mamba-based techniques.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators are computationally expensive for city-scale coastal planning, while existing DL methods face data scarcity and high-dimensional output challenges.

Method: Developed a novel lightweight CNN-based model using a vision-based, low-resource DL framework to predict coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation scenarios.

Result: The model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing mean absolute error in predicted flood depth maps by nearly 20% on average.

Conclusion: The approach serves as a scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, enabling effective mitigation strategies against climate change impacts.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering

Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with complex temporal dynamics and action sequence comprehension in videos.

Method: Introduces stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder to capture action progression and frame relationships before passing visual tokens to the LLM.

Result: Significantly improves temporal reasoning, outperforms existing models in video QA tasks, and achieves up to +5.5% improvement on VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME benchmarks.

Conclusion: Enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure addresses a critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to

TL;DR: FlexICL is a flexible in-context learning framework for segmenting bony regions in pediatric elbow and wrist ultrasound images, achieving robust performance with only 5% labeled training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of time-consuming and costly pixel-wise expert annotations for training deep learning models in ultrasound fracture diagnosis, while improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling lightly trained users to perform exams confidently.

Method: Proposes FlexICL framework using in-context learning for intra-video segmentation, where experts annotate only a small subset of frames. Introduces novel image concatenation techniques and training strategies, integrating multiple augmentation strategies to enhance performance with limited labeled data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models (Painter, MAE-VQGAN) and conventional segmentation models (U-Net, TransUNet) by 1-27% Dice coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps across four wrist and elbow datasets.

Conclusion: FlexICL shows potential as an efficient and scalable solution for ultrasound image segmentation, particularly suitable for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

TL;DR: Dynamic negative prompting using Vision-Language Models to adaptively generate context-aware negative prompts during diffusion model denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional negative prompting uses fixed prompts, which lack context awareness and adaptability during the denoising process.

Method: Generate intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and query a VLM to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts adaptively.

Result: Evaluated on benchmark datasets showing trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment.

Conclusion: Dynamic negative prompting with VLMs improves context awareness in diffusion models compared to fixed negative prompting approaches.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [72] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PReMA is a novel adversarial attack that manipulates multi-modal diffusion models by modifying input images while keeping prompts fixed, enabling generation of inappropriate content without changing text inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal diffusion models have inadequate alignment between text and image modalities, creating risks for generating NSFW content. Current attacks focus on adversarial prompts, but image-only attacks remain unexplored.

Method: Proposes Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) that creates adversarial images to manipulate model outputs with fixed prompts. Evaluated on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations confirm PReMA's potent efficacy in manipulating generated content through adversarial images alone, without requiring prompt modifications.

Conclusion: PReMA poses a novel threat to multi-modal diffusion model integrity, especially in applications with fixed prompts, highlighting critical security vulnerabilities in current alignment approaches.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoExo-Con benchmark evaluates Video-LLMs' temporal understanding consistency across egocentric and exocentric viewpoints, revealing models struggle with cross-view consistency. Proposed View-GRPO framework improves consistency through reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study whether Video-LLMs can achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture the same event from different viewpoints (egocentric vs exocentric).

Method: Introduced EgoExo-Con benchmark with synchronized video pairs and human-refined queries. Proposed View-GRPO reinforcement learning framework to strengthen view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging consistent comprehension across viewpoints.

Result: Existing Video-LLMs fail to maintain consistency across viewpoints, performing worse than single-view. Naive fine-tuning with synchronized videos improves consistency but underperforms single-view training. View-GRPO demonstrates superiority over SFT and GRPO in improving cross-view consistency.

Conclusion: Cross-view temporal consistency is a critical limitation in Video-LLMs. View-GRPO effectively addresses this by balancing view-specific reasoning with cross-view consistency, showing promising improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleAgent is the first agent system for Oracle Bone Script (OBS) research that integrates multiple analysis tools with LLMs and a comprehensive multimodal knowledge base to address challenges in OBS interpretation and information retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OBS research faces challenges in complex interpretation workflows and inefficient information organization/retrieval, requiring substantial effort from scholars to search and manage resources.

Method: Developed OracleAgent system that integrates multiple OBS analysis tools powered by LLMs, constructs a domain-specific multimodal knowledge base with over 1.4M character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts through multi-year data collection and expert annotation.

Result: OracleAgent achieves superior performance in multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading MLLMs like GPT-4o, and significantly reduces time cost for domain experts in OBS research.

Conclusion: OracleAgent represents a significant advancement toward practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems, effectively addressing the core challenges in OBS studies.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses without requiring pre-calibrated camera inputs, eliminating the need for external pose estimation tools like COLMAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional novel view synthesis methods rely on external camera pose estimation tools (e.g., COLMAP) which introduce computational bottlenecks and propagate errors, limiting performance in challenging scenarios.

Method: Co-optimization strategy with two interleaved phases: (1) updating 3D Gaussian parameters via differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and (2) refining camera poses using customized 3D optical flow with geometric and photometric constraints.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality and surpasses standard COLMAP-based baseline in general, particularly effective in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations and sparse features.

Conclusion: The proposed joint optimization framework successfully eliminates dependency on external pose estimation tools while achieving superior reconstruction quality and pose accuracy compared to both COLMAP-free and COLMAP-based methods.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WOD-E2E is a new benchmark dataset for vision-based end-to-end driving focusing on challenging long-tail scenarios, with a novel evaluation metric called Rater Feedback Score that measures trajectory preference alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E driving benchmarks mainly test nominal scenarios and lack adequate evaluation for long-tail situations. Existing metrics don't effectively capture driving's multi-modal nature or evaluate performance in rare but critical scenarios.

Method: Created WOD-E2E dataset with 4,021 driving segments (12 hours) specifically curated for long-tail scenarios occurring less than 0.03% frequency. Includes routing info, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 cameras. Introduced RFS metric that measures alignment with rater-annotated trajectory preferences instead of distance to logged waypoints.

Result: Released dataset with rater preference labels for validation set, with test set used for 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge. Provides comprehensive evaluation framework for challenging driving scenarios.

Conclusion: WOD-E2E aims to advance research in generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving by focusing on complex real-world situations and providing better evaluation metrics for long-tail scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes integrating gradient-based attention information with CNN features to improve RGB-D indoor SLAM performance, particularly for large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While attention models and visualization techniques provide insights into CNN reasoning, explicit integration of gradient-based attention into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains limited, especially for visual tasks like SLAM where attentive object locations can enhance performance.

Method: The authors integrate layer-wise attention information derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve frame association in RGB-D indoor SLAM.

Result: Experimental results show improved performance compared to baseline methods, with particular benefits observed for large environments.

Conclusion: The integration of task-specific network attention with CNN representations effectively enhances SLAM performance, demonstrating the value of gradient-based attention mechanisms for visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FullPart is a novel 3D part generation framework that combines implicit and explicit representations, using implicit diffusion for bounding box layout and full-resolution voxel grids for detailed part generation, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous part generators using implicit vector-set tokens lack geometric details, while explicit voxel methods with shared global grids degrade small part quality due to insufficient voxel allocation.

Method: Combines implicit box vector-set diffusion for layout generation with explicit full-resolution voxel grids for each part. Uses center-point encoding to maintain global coherence between parts of different sizes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation, enabling synthesis of intricate details even for small parts by generating each part at full resolution.

Conclusion: FullPart effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by combining implicit and explicit paradigms, and introduces PartVerse-XL dataset to advance 3D part generation research.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BasicAVSR is a strong baseline model for arbitrary-scale video super-resolution that integrates adaptive multi-scale frequency priors, flow-guided propagation, second-order motion compensation, and hyper-upsampling to achieve superior performance across different scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution faces challenges in spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and computational complexity when handling various scaling factors.

Method: Proposes BasicAVSR with four key components: adaptive multi-scale frequency priors from Laplacian pyramids, flow-guided propagation unit, second-order motion compensation unit, and hyper-upsampling unit. Offers three propagation variants for different application scenarios.

Result: BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods in super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference speed across different experimental scenarios.

Conclusion: The work advances state-of-the-art in AVSR and extends core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios, providing an effective and adaptable solution.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Multi-View Mammography and Language Model (MV-MLM) that uses synthetic radiology reports and multi-view supervision for breast cancer classification and risk prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with strong data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large annotated datasets for breast cancer CAD models are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Vision-Language Models offer a solution by enhancing robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging.

Method: Leverages multi-view supervision with cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs, including multiple mammogram views and corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. Uses a novel joint visual-textual learning strategy.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in malignancy classification, subtype classification, and image-based cancer risk prediction on both private and public datasets. Outperforms fully supervised and VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports.

Conclusion: The proposed MV-MLM demonstrates strong data efficiency and generalization capabilities for breast cancer analysis without requiring actual radiology reports, making it a promising approach for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

TL;DR: A machine learning system using YOLOv8 for real-time auto-rickshaw detection in Bangladesh traffic, achieving 83.447% mAP50 and over 78% precision/recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Auto-rickshaws in South Asian countries need monitoring due to traffic restrictions, but existing surveillance struggles to distinguish them from similar vehicles like pedal-powered rickshaws, and manual analysis is inefficient.

Method: Used YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection, trained on 1,730 annotated images captured under various traffic conditions, with the dataset publicly released.

Result: The model achieved 83.447% mAP50 and binary precision/recall values above 78%, performing well in both dense and sparse traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively automates auto-rickshaw detection in real-time traffic monitoring, providing a practical solution for traffic management in South Asian contexts.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

TL;DR: CRAG-MM is a comprehensive benchmark for multi-modal RAG with 6.5K image-question-answer triplets and 2K multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, designed for wearable device scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive benchmark for multi-modal RAG tasks, especially for wearable scenarios where users interact with their environment through smart glasses.

Method: Created CRAG-MM with diverse datasets including 6.2K egocentric images, carefully constructed questions reflecting real-world challenges, and designed three tasks with associated retrieval corpus and APIs.

Result: Straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% truthfulness on single-turn QA and 43% on multi-turn QA, while state-of-the-art industry solutions show similar performance (32%/45%), indicating significant room for improvement.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM successfully highlights the challenges in multi-modal RAG and has already made impact through KDD Cup 2025, with winning solutions improving baseline performance by 28%.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

*Wontae Choi,Jaelin Lee,Hyung Sup Yun,Byeungwoo Jeon,Il Yong Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTDiff is a diffusion-based framework for high-resolution motion trajectory estimation from single motion-blurred images, outperforming existing methods in deblurring and coded exposure photography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion representations from single blurred images are low-quality (coarse-grained and inaccurate), limiting performance in computational imaging applications.

Method: Uses conditional diffusion framework with multi-scale feature maps from blurred images, plus training method that ensures fine-grained trajectory identification, consistent shape estimation, and pixel connectivity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

Conclusion: MoTDiff successfully achieves high-quality, high-resolution motion trajectory estimation from single motion-blurred images using diffusion models.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a

*Jinho Choi,Hyesu Lim,Steffen Schneider,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptScope is an automated framework that discovers and quantifies human-interpretable concepts in visual datasets using Sparse Autoencoders on vision foundation model representations, enabling systematic bias identification and dataset analysis without manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset bias is pervasive in machine learning but challenging to identify without costly fine-grained annotations. There's a need for scalable, automated methods to systematically discover and quantify biases in visual datasets.

Method: Uses Sparse Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models to discover concepts. Categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels. Enables class-level dataset characterization and concept-based subgrouping for robustness evaluation.

Result: Validated to capture diverse visual concepts (objects, textures, backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, actions). Concept activations produce spatial attributions aligned with semantically meaningful image regions. Successfully detected known biases (background bias in Waterbirds) and uncovered unannotated biases (co-occurring objects in ImageNet).

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides a practical tool for automated dataset auditing and model diagnostics, offering scalable bias identification without requiring manual annotations.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for 3D human pose estimation from sketches using a "learn from synthesis" strategy, creating synthetic sketch-3D pose pairs and training an end-to-end framework that outperforms previous methods in accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sketch-to-pose methods face challenges due to abstract and disproportionate sketches, limited by lack of large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, relying on time-consuming optimization with poor generalizability.

Method: Uses diffusion model to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human poses, creating SKEP-120K synthetic dataset. Combines 2D pose detectors, generative diffusion priors, and feed-forward neural network with heuristic loss functions for geometric coherence and self-contact preservation.

Result: Qualitative, quantitative, and subjective evaluations show the model substantially surpasses previous methods in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed "learn from synthesis" strategy and end-to-end framework effectively address sketch-to-pose challenges, enabling accurate and efficient 3D human pose estimation from diverse sketch styles.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

*Mehdi Khaleghi,Nastaran Khaleghi,Sobhan Sheykhivand,Sebelan Danishvar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) for supply chain risk management and sustainability, achieving high accuracy (98.95% for risk management, 100% for product classification) on SupplyGraph and DataCo datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supply chain sustainability and risk management are crucial for optimal performance. Correct product classification and leveraging information dependencies in supply chains are essential for developing sustainable networks and improving efficiency.

Method: Uses a novel geometric deep network combining convolutional and geometric deep learning. Proposes Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN) to leverage information dependencies and derive invisible states in supply chain datasets.

Result: Achieved 98.95% accuracy for risk management, 100% accuracy for 5 product group classification, 98.07% for 4 product relation classification, and 92.37% for 25 company relation classification. Outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Ch-EGN method effectively enhances supply chain sustainability and risk management through high-accuracy classification and prediction, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale diverse document layout dataset, and OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with a coarse-to-fine learning paradigm for document layout generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document layout generation remains underexplored compared to document layout analysis, with existing datasets dominated by academic papers and lacking diversity in document types like newspapers and magazines.

Method: Curated OmniLayout-1M dataset covering six document types, and developed OmniLayout-LLM with two-stage coarse-to-fine learning: learning universal layout principles from coarse categories, then transferring to specific domains with fine-grained annotations.

Result: The approach achieves strong performance on multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing existing layout generation methods and latest general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and model address the diversity gap in document layout generation and demonstrate superior performance across various document types.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

*Shiho Matta,Lis Kanashiro Pereira,Peitao Han,Fei Cheng,Shigeru Kitazawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with temporal reasoning, performing poorly on judging video playback direction (forward vs backward) compared to humans, especially for physically irreversible processes and causal actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models have weak temporal understanding in videos and this capability is under-evaluated, despite their strong performance on other multimodal tasks.

Method: Created AoT-PsyPhyBENCH benchmark using psychophysically validated stimuli to test VLMs' ability to judge arrow of time in natural videos, comparing against human behavioral baselines.

Result: Most VLMs perform near chance level, and even the best models lag significantly behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes and causal manual actions that humans recognize instantly.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems - they capture visual-semantic correlations but lack inductive biases for temporal continuity and causal understanding.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCLFuse is a novel infrared and visible image fusion method inspired by human cognitive laws, using multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder and diffusion model with time-varying physical guidance to achieve state-of-the-art fusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion methods struggle with balancing modal information, have limited generative capabilities, and lack interpretability in modal information selection, affecting reliability in complex scenarios.

Method: Uses multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder for information decomposition and integrates diffusion model's probabilistic generative capability with physical laws through time-varying physical guidance mechanism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates advantages in enhancing structural consistency and detail quality by drawing inspiration from human cognition for generative image fusion.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Motivation: To investigate how different CNN architectures complement each other for periocular verification at varying distances and leverage their complementary strengths through fusion.

Method: Trained three CNN architectures on eye crops from VGGFace2, analyzed performance with cosine and chi2 metrics, compared network initializations, applied score-level fusion via logistic regression, and used LIME heatmaps with Jensen-Shannon divergence to compare attention patterns.

Result: ResNet50 performed best individually, but fusion provided substantial gains especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps revealed networks focus on distinct image regions, explaining their complementarity. Method significantly outperformed previous works on UBIPr.

Conclusion: Different CNN architectures exhibit complementary attention patterns for periocular verification, and their fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the value of leveraging architectural diversity.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: CATG is a novel autonomous driving planning framework that uses Constrained Flow Matching to generate diverse, safe trajectories while incorporating driving aggressiveness as a control signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address mode collapse in imitation learning methods and the inability of existing generative approaches to directly incorporate safety and physical constraints during generation.

Method: Uses Constrained Flow Matching to explicitly model the flow matching process, imposing safety and kinematic constraints directly within the generation process, and parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal.

Result: Achieved 2nd place on NavSim v2 challenge with EPDMS score of 51.31 and won the Innovation Award.

Conclusion: CATG successfully addresses mode collapse and constraint incorporation issues in autonomous driving planning through constrained flow matching, enabling diverse and safe trajectory generation with controllable driving style.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Periocular region offers high discrimination with minimal acquisition constraints, but existing works use small datasets. This study uses large-scale training data to improve performance.

Method: Three CNN architectures of varying depth/complexity trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops from VGGFace2, tested on VGGFace2-Pose and UFPR-Periocular datasets.

Result: VGGFace2-Pose: 9-15% EER (higher than full-face 3-6%), UFPR-Periocular: 1-2% EER (best reported to date) due to better image quality and consistent protocols.

Conclusion: Large-scale training significantly improves periocular recognition, with best performance achieved on controlled datasets like UFPR-Periocular.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Motivation: Existing AEOS scheduling methods simplify the complexities of large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent constraints, limiting their real-world performance. There is a need for more realistic and comprehensive approaches.

Method: Developed AEOS-Bench benchmark suite with 16,410 scenarios generated via high-fidelity simulation, and AEOS-Former - a Transformer-based scheduling model with constraint-aware attention mechanism and internal constraint module that explicitly models satellite physical/operational limits through simulation-based iterative learning.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework with AEOS-Bench benchmark and AEOS-Former model provides a robust solution for AEOS constellation scheduling, addressing the limitations of existing methods through realistic simulation and constraint-aware learning.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an evidential fusion paradigm to combine CNN and ViT backbones for diabetic retinopathy diagnosis, leveraging local and global feature extraction capabilities to overcome performance bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DR diagnosis systems using single-type backbones (CNN or ViT) have performance limitations due to their inherent shortcomings. Integrating both can leverage CNN's local feature extraction and ViT's global feature capturing abilities.

Method: Uses evidential theory to fuse features from different backbones through deep evidential networks, transforming features into supporting evidences to form aggregated opinions for adaptive fusion tuning.

Result: Experimental evaluation on two public DR grading datasets shows improved accuracy compared to state-of-the-art frameworks and provides excellent interpretability for feature fusion and decision-making.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid model effectively combines CNN and ViT strengths through evidential fusion, achieving better DR grading performance with enhanced interpretability.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLYPH-SR is a vision-language-guided diffusion framework for image super-resolution that specifically optimizes for both text legibility and perceptual quality in scene-text images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current super-resolution methods focus on distortion or perceptual metrics that are insensitive to character-level errors, failing to preserve scene-text legibility which is crucial for practical applications like OCR in surveillance, autonomy, and retail analytics.

Method: Uses a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet guided by OCR data and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance, trained on synthetic corpus while keeping main SR branch frozen.

Result: Improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baselines on SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 datasets at x4 and x8 scales while maintaining competitive perceptual quality metrics.

Conclusion: GLYPH-SR successfully delivers super-resolution that achieves both high readability and high visual realism, making it effective for practical deployments where text legibility is critical.

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods lack spatial attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence in generated images.

Method: Uses Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction, fine-tunes Stable Diffusion 2.1 via LoRA for neural-visual alignment, and employs ControlNet for spatial conditioning with saliency maps.

Result: Achieves significant improvement in low- and high-level image feature quality on THINGS-EEG dataset, with strong alignment to human visual attention.

Conclusion: Attentional priors resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoCoT2V-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating long video generation under complex prompts, addressing gaps in existing evaluation methods by focusing on fine-grained alignment, narrative coherence, and thematic expression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for text-to-video generation rely on simplified prompts and low-level metrics, overlooking fine-grained alignment with complex prompts and abstract dimensions like narrative coherence and thematic expression.

Method: Proposed LoCoT2V-Bench with realistic complex prompts based on real-world videos, and a multi-dimensional evaluation framework including new metrics: event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content clarity, and HERD (Human Expectation Realization Degree) for narrative flow, emotional response, and character development.

Result: Evaluation of nine representative LVG models showed they perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects but struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

### [99] [A-TPT: Angular Diversity Calibration Properties for Test-Time Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26441)
*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A-TPT is a novel test-time prompt tuning framework that improves vision-language model calibration by maximizing angular diversity between class-wise textual features on the unit hypersphere.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TPT methods lack optimal angular separation between class-wise textual features, which hurts calibration performance and raises concerns about VLMs' reliability and safety.

Method: Introduces angular diversity by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between normalized textual features on the unit hypersphere to achieve uniform distribution of features.

Result: Consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing aggregate average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy, with superior zero-shot calibration on distribution shifts and medical datasets.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity achieves well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM calibration during test-time adaptation, with theoretical grounding and practical effectiveness demonstrated.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper adapts foundational 3D reconstruction models (DUSt3R/MASt3R) for point tracking using 3D grounded correspondence, achieving competitive performance on multiple datasets by combining reconstruction loss with dynamic correspondence training and a visibility head.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models for point tracking tasks, addressing limitations in handling both static and dynamic points across various datasets.

Method: Fine-tune MASt3R for point tracking using synthetic data, combine reconstruction loss with dynamic correspondence training, add visibility head, and train/evaluate on frame pairs containing query points without temporal context.

Result: Achieved competitive or superior performance: 73.8 δ_avg / 85.8% occlusion accuracy on TAP-Vid-DAVIS (vs CoTracker2's 75.7/88.3%), significantly outperformed CoTracker3 on EgoPoints (61.3 vs 54.2) and RGB-S (87.0 vs 82.8).

Conclusion: The adapted 3D reconstruction models provide effective point tracking solutions, demonstrating strong performance across static and dynamic scenarios with minimal temporal context requirements.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineGrainedAD improves few-shot anomaly detection by providing multi-level fine-grained textual descriptions and aligning them with visual regions through learnable prompts and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FSAD methods suffer from semantic misalignment between image-level descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies due to lack of detailed textual descriptions, leading to sub-optimal localization performance.

Method: Proposes MFSC for multi-level fine-grained textual descriptions, with MLLP for fine-grained semantics in learnable prompts and MLSA for region aggregation and multi-level alignment training.

Result: Achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Conclusion: FineGrainedAD effectively addresses semantic misalignment in FSAD through multi-level fine-grained descriptions and alignment mechanisms, improving anomaly localization.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

*Pei Peng,MingKun Xie,Hang Hao,Tong Jin,ShengJun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A causal inference approach to address object-context shortcuts in vision-language models by synthesizing counterfactual embeddings and estimating Total Direct Effect to improve zero-shot reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-context shortcuts in vision-language models undermine zero-shot reliability when test scenes differ from training co-occurrences, creating biased predictions.

Method: Estimate object and background expectations in CLIP's representation space, synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with alternative contexts, and use Total Direct Effect to subtract background-only activation.

Result: Substantially improves worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks without retraining or prompt design, establishing new zero-shot state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Provides a lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning through causal inference.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

*Xin Guo,Zhiheng Xi,Yiwen Ding,Yitao Zhai,Xiaowei Shi,Xunliang Cai,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the Matthew effect in self-improvement of LVLMs, where models prioritize simple queries over complex ones, leading to imbalanced optimization. It proposes distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling strategies to re-balance head-tail data during self-improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-improvement in LVLMs suffers from the Matthew effect, where models excel at simple queries but struggle with complex ones, causing imbalanced optimization that prioritizes simple reasoning skills and hinders complex reasoning capabilities.

Method: Four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, designed to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process.

Result: Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models show consistent improvement in visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

Conclusion: The proposed head-tail re-balancing strategies effectively counteract the Matthew effect in self-improvement, enabling better optimization across both simple and complex reasoning tasks and overcoming performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

TL;DR: An adaptable edge detector using cellular automata optimized by meta-heuristics with transfer learning was developed. Expanding the optimization search space was ineffective, and the model showed adaptability but transfer learning provided no significant improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address weaknesses in edge detection such as difficulty detecting loose edges and lack of context for specific problems, by creating an adaptable detector that can adjust to image properties.

Method: Developed a two-dimensional cellular automaton-based edge detector optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning techniques, then analyzed the impact of expanding optimization search space and model adaptability.

Result: Expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not effective for the chosen image set. The model was able to adapt to input regardless of validation, but transfer learning techniques showed no significant improvements.

Conclusion: While the adaptable edge detector demonstrated robustness in adapting to different inputs, expanding the optimization search space was ineffective and transfer learning did not provide meaningful enhancements to the model's performance.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

TL;DR: SA²Net is a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network for spine segmentation in ultrasound VPI images, addressing challenges in learning global contextual knowledge and encoding structural bone features for scoliosis diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spine segmentation faces challenges in learning global contextual knowledge due to high spatial correlation of bone features, and needs to encode rich structural knowledge about bone shapes and positions into the segmentation process.

Method: Proposes scale-adaptive complementary strategy for cross-dimensional long-distance correlation features, structure-affinity transformation that combines semantic features with class-specific affinity using Transformer decoder, and feature mixing loss aggregation for enhanced training.

Result: SA²Net achieves superior segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improved robustness and accuracy in spine segmentation.

Conclusion: The method shows strong potential as a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal image analysis, with adaptability to various backbones enhancing its practical applications.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

TL;DR: Automated video ad clipping framework using audio-visual fusion model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods on new AdSum204 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual creation of multiple ad versions at different durations is labor-intensive; need automated solution specifically for advertising context.

Method: Two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts frame importance for shot selection, first to frame video clipping as shot selection problem for ads.

Result: Model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple metrics (Average Precision, AUC, Spearman, Kendall) on AdSum204 dataset.

Conclusion: Audio-visual fusion approach effectively automates video ad clipping, emphasizing audio's critical role in advertising.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

Motivation: AI systems struggle with unfamiliar scenarios without labeled data, limiting deployment in dynamic real-world environments that require generalization across unseen contexts.

Method: Integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions, plus a dynamic reasoning module that combines global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.

Result: 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy on zero-shot benchmarks (COCO, Visual Genome, Open Images), with robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to vision-language fusion.

Conclusion: The framework provides scalable and interpretable context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot generalization capabilities for dynamic real-world applications.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATCH is a plug-and-play framework for cross-domain VQA adaptation that uses lightweight domain classification and dual adapters to improve generalization without retraining backbone models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA models like LLaVA perform well on natural images but degrade significantly on out-of-domain scenarios (remote sensing, medical imaging, math diagrams) due to distribution shifts and lack of domain adaptation mechanisms.

Method: Decouples visual and linguistic adaptation using two lightweight modules: domain classifier for input image type identification, and dual adapter mechanism (Prompt Adapter for language modulation, Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment) dynamically injected via unified hook interface.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks: +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on MedVQA-RAD, +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA without retraining backbone model.

Conclusion: CATCH provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling practical deployment across diverse application domains with minimal architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified multimodal model that can handle interleaved vision-language inputs and outputs, enabling complex multimodal reasoning and generation tasks.

Method: Pre-trained end-to-end with next-token prediction on 10T+ token vision-language data, post-trained with reinforcement learning, and uses Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA) for 20x faster inference.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image on generation tasks, superior results on interleaved generation, and enables spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and embodied manipulation.

Conclusion: Emu3.5 demonstrates strong native multimodal capabilities and generalizable world-modeling abilities, representing a significant advancement in unified vision-language modeling.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching is a computational super-resolution method using guided conditional flow matching to learn strong data priors, achieving the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism on biological structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational super-resolution in fluorescence microscopy is ill-posed and requires strong priors to extrapolate missing frequencies. With better machine learning techniques, stronger priors can be learned for improved CSR results.

Method: ResMatching uses guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data priors for computational super-resolution. It can sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and provides pixel-wise uncertainty estimates.

Result: ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results on 4 diverse biological structures from BioSR dataset, outperforming 7 baselines. It shows best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism, particularly effective with noisy low-resolution images.

Conclusion: ResMatching enables effective computational super-resolution with calibrated posterior distributions and pixel-wise uncertainty estimates, guiding users to reject uncertain predictions.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional crop yield prediction methods lack scalability and granularity needed for precision farming, creating a need for more detailed and actionable tools.

Method: Fine-tunes Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M geospatial foundation model for continuous regression, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery into pixel-level yield maps.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over existing deep learning yield prediction models on Canadian Prairies dataset, providing continuous high-resolution output.

Conclusion: Validates approach of bridging large-scale Earth observation with on-farm decision-making, offering scalable solution for detailed agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

### [112] [Spiking Patches: Asynchronous, Sparse, and Efficient Tokens for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26614)
*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spiking Patches tokenizer preserves event camera properties (asynchronous, sparse) while matching/surpassing frame/voxel accuracy with 3.4-10.4x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event representations (frames, voxels) lose the asynchronous and spatially sparse properties of event cameras, which are their key advantages.

Method: Propose Spiking Patches tokenizer that tokenizes event streams while preserving asynchronous and sparse properties, evaluated with GNN, PCN, and Transformer on gesture recognition and object detection.

Result: 3.4x faster than voxels, 10.4x faster than frames while matching accuracy; absolute improvements up to 3.8% for gesture recognition and 1.4% for object detection.

Conclusion: Tokenization with Spiking Patches preserves event camera properties without sacrificing accuracy, marking a new direction in event-based vision.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

Conclusion: Delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities in AV object detection, emphasizing the transformative potential of emerging AI technologies like VLMs, LLMs, and Generative AI.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning optical flow models achieve sub-kilometer accuracy for sea ice drift estimation from SAR imagery, outperforming classical methods and providing continuous motion fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sea ice drift estimation is critical for Arctic navigation and climate research, but classical optical flow methods have limitations in complex scenarios.

Method: Large-scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models on RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated against GNSS-tracked buoys using endpoint error and F1-all metrics.

Result: Several models achieved sub-kilometer accuracy (300-400m), capturing consistent regional drift patterns and demonstrating effective transfer from computer vision to polar remote sensing.

Conclusion: Deep learning optical flow methods can be effectively applied to sea ice drift estimation, providing spatially continuous motion fields that benefit navigation and climate modeling.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes two scene-based information fusion techniques to improve object detection under occlusions using RPN-DCNN networks, showing improved recall and precision on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions present major challenges for object recognition algorithms, and scene context information can help reduce errors caused by occlusions, similar to how biological vision works.

Method: Two distinct scene-based fusion techniques: 1) pre-prediction scene-based network selection, and 2) post-detection fusion of scene knowledge into initial object scores from RPN. Also explores training methodologies using combinations of occluded and unoccluded images.

Result: Demonstrated overall improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods on challenging datasets with partial occlusions. Training on both occluded and unoccluded images showed better performance than other training approaches.

Conclusion: The method is interpretable, easily adaptable to other datasets, and offers promising directions for future research and practical applications in occlusion-robust object detection.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB) to evaluate vision-language models' chart grounding capabilities, including data extraction, element localization, and attribute recognition from diverse charts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract fine-grained structures from charts, which hinders their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them.

Method: Developed ChartAB benchmark with JSON template for evaluation metrics, and introduced a two-stage inference workflow to evaluate VLMs' capability to align and compare elements/attributes across two charts.

Result: Analysis revealed new insights into VLMs' perception biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding, highlighting fine-grained discrepancies among models.

Conclusion: The findings point to specific skills that need to be strengthened in current VLMs for better chart understanding and comparison capabilities.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A general hierarchical motion modeling method that learns structured motion relationships from data using graph-based hierarchies, decomposing motions into parent-inherited patterns and local residuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on manually-defined hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting generalizability across different tasks. There's a need for data-driven hierarchical modeling that can adapt to various motion scenarios.

Method: Formulates hierarchy inference as a differentiable graph learning problem using graph neural networks, where vertices represent elemental motions and directed edges capture parent-child dependencies. Represents motions using graph-based hierarchies that decompose global motions into parent-inherited patterns and local residuals.

Result: Successfully reconstructs intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D translational and 2D rotational motion cases. Produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes.

Conclusion: Provides an adaptable, data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks, offering better generalizability than manually-defined hierarchies.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D motion generation models face generalization bottlenecks, while video generation has shown remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, offering transferable insights.

Method: 1) ViMoGen-228K dataset integrating MoCap data, web videos, and synthesized samples; 2) ViMoGen diffusion transformer with gated multimodal conditioning; 3) ViMoGen-light distilled variant; 4) MBench hierarchical evaluation benchmark.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability.

Conclusion: The framework successfully transfers video generation knowledge to motion generation, achieving superior generalization and performance through systematic data, modeling, and evaluation improvements.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach for fine-grained image geo-localization at continental scale using proxy classification and aerial imagery embeddings to overcome data sparsity and domain gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard image retrieval fails at global scale due to volume (>100M images) and coverage issues, while existing scalable solutions trade accuracy for scale - global classification is coarse (>10km) and cross-view retrieval suffers from domain gaps in small regions.

Method: Uses proxy classification during training to learn rich feature representations encoding precise location, then combines learned prototypes with aerial imagery embeddings to increase robustness to ground-level data sparsity.

Result: Achieves fine-grained retrieval across multiple countries, localizing within 200m for more than 68% of queries on a European dataset.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach enables direct, fine-grained geo-localization at continental scale, overcoming limitations of both global classification and cross-view retrieval methods.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: SEE4D is a pose-free video-to-4D method that uses virtual cameras and view-conditional inpainting to synthesize spatiotemporal content from casual videos without 3D supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video-to-4D methods require manual camera pose annotations which are labor-intensive and brittle for in-the-wild videos. Warp-then-inpaint approaches entangle camera motion with scene dynamics, complicating modeling and inference.

Method: Replaces trajectory prediction with rendering to fixed virtual cameras, separating camera control from scene modeling. Uses view-conditional video inpainting trained to denoise warped images and inpaint occluded regions across viewpoints. Features spatiotemporal autoregressive inference with virtual-camera splines and overlapping windows.

Result: Achieves superior generalization and improved performance on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks compared to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Conclusion: SEE4D advances practical 4D world modeling from casual videos by eliminating the need for explicit 3D annotations and providing a more robust framework for synthesizing spatiotemporal content.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

### [126] [Masked Diffusion Captioning for Visual Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26799)
*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Masked diffusion captioning (MDC) learns visual features by reconstructing masked text tokens in image captions using an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model, achieving competitive performance with autoregressive and contrastive methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a visual feature learning approach that doesn't depend on token position in sequences like autoregressive methods, reducing the need for auxiliary objectives while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: Train an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model where text tokens in image-caption pairs are randomly masked, and a visual-conditioned decoder reconstructs the original text. The learned visual features are then applied to downstream vision tasks.

Result: Linear probing experiments across various academic-scale models and datasets show that MDC-learned visual features are competitive with those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Conclusion: Masked diffusion captioning provides an effective alternative to autoregressive and contrastive methods for visual feature learning, with position-independent learning signals and competitive downstream performance.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniX is a unified framework that repurposes 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures, and PBR materials to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically based rendering, relighting, and simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance panorama-based 2D lifting techniques to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes that support physically based rendering, relighting, and simulation, addressing the limitation of existing approaches that focus on appearance generation while ignoring intrinsic property perception.

Method: OmniX uses a lightweight and efficient cross-modal adapter structure to reuse 2D generative priors for panoramic perception, generation, and completion tasks. The framework is trained on a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniX in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation, enabling immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation.

Conclusion: OmniX opens new possibilities for generating graphics-ready 3D scenes by leveraging 2D generative priors for panoramic perception of intrinsic properties, advancing beyond appearance-only generation approaches.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

*Ziyu Guo,Xinyan Chen,Renrui Zhang,Ruichuan An,Yu Qi,Dongzhi Jiang,Xiangtai Li,Manyuan Zhang,Hongsheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generation models like Veo-3 show emerging visual reasoning capabilities but are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, particularly struggling with long-horizon causal reasoning and abstract logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether current video generation models can serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios, given their demonstrated ability to produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos that suggest substantial world knowledge encoding.

Method: Conducted an empirical study evaluating Veo-3's reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions (spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic) using a curated benchmark called MME-CoF for Chain-of-Frame reasoning assessment.

Result: Video models show promising reasoning on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, but are limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic.

Conclusion: Current video models are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

*Soufiane Essahli,Oussama Sarsar,Imane Fouad,Anas Motii,Ahmed Bentajer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: FakeZero is a client-side browser extension that detects fake news on Facebook and X using local AI models, achieving high accuracy while preserving user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combat the rapid spread of misinformation on social media platforms while maintaining user privacy by processing all data locally on the device.

Method: Three-stage training curriculum: baseline fine-tuning, domain-adaptive training with focal loss and adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantization. Uses DistilBERT-Quant and TinyBERT-Quant models running locally through Chromium messaging API.

Result: DistilBERT-Quant (67.6 MB) achieves 97.1% macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, AUROC 0.996 with 103ms latency. TinyBERT-Quant (14.7 MB) maintains 95.7% macro-F1, 96.1% accuracy with 40ms latency.

Conclusion: High-quality fake news detection is feasible under tight resource constraints with minimal performance loss, providing a privacy-preserving tool for misinformation mitigation and enabling large-scale data collection for research.

Abstract: Social platforms distribute information at unprecedented speed, which in turn
accelerates the spread of misinformation and threatens public discourse. We
present FakeZero, a fully client-side, cross-platform browser extension that
flags unreliable posts on Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) while the user
scrolls. All computation, DOM scraping, tokenisation, Transformer inference,
and UI rendering run locally through the Chromium messaging API, so no personal
data leaves the device.FakeZero employs a three-stage training curriculum:
baseline fine-tuning and domain-adaptive training enhanced with focal loss,
adversarial augmentation, and post-training quantisation. Evaluated on a
dataset of 239,000 posts, the DistilBERT-Quant model (67.6 MB) reaches 97.1%
macro-F1, 97.4% accuracy, and an AUROC of 0.996, with a median latency of
approximately 103 ms on a commodity laptop. A memory-efficient TinyBERT-Quant
variant retains 95.7% macro-F1 and 96.1% accuracy while shrinking the model to
14.7 MB and lowering latency to approximately 40 ms, showing that high-quality
fake-news detection is feasible under tight resource budgets with only modest
performance loss.By providing inline credibility cues, the extension can serve
as a valuable tool for policymakers seeking to curb the spread of
misinformation across social networks. With user consent, FakeZero also opens
the door for researchers to collect large-scale datasets of fake news in the
wild, enabling deeper analysis and the development of more robust detection
techniques.

*Kaiwen Zhou,Ahmed Elgohary,A S M Iftekhar,Amin Saied*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SIRAJ is a red-teaming framework for LLM agents that uses dynamic test case generation and iterative adversarial attacks to discover safety vulnerabilities, with a model distillation approach to reduce costs while maintaining effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents' ability to plan and use tools creates new safety risks, making comprehensive red-teaming essential for vulnerability discovery and safe deployment.

Method: Two-step process: 1) Generate diverse seed test cases covering risk outcomes and tool-use trajectories, 2) Iteratively construct and refine model-based adversarial attacks using execution trajectories. Includes model distillation using structured teacher reasoning to train smaller, effective models.

Result: Seed test generation provides 2-2.5x boost in risk outcome and tool-calling trajectory coverage. Distilled 8B red-teamer model improves attack success rate by 100%, outperforming 671B Deepseek-R1 model.

Conclusion: The framework effectively discovers LLM agent vulnerabilities through iterative attacks and structured reasoning, with smaller distilled models achieving superior performance to much larger models.

Abstract: The ability of LLM agents to plan and invoke tools exposes them to new safety
risks, making a comprehensive red-teaming system crucial for discovering
vulnerabilities and ensuring their safe deployment. We present SIRAJ: a generic
red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic
two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse
seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and
risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based
adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To
optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that
leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller
models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings,
our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage
of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer
model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1
model. Our ablations and analyses validate the effectiveness of the iterative
framework, structured reasoning, and the generalization of our red-teamer
models.

*Haohua Duan,Liyao Xiang,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PVMark enables publicly verifiable watermark detection for LLMs using zero-knowledge proofs, allowing third parties to verify detection without revealing secret keys.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM watermarking schemes lack public verifiability - private detection cannot prove faithful execution, while public keys enable removal attacks. This creates a trust dilemma.

Method: Proposes PVMark plugin based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) that generates proofs of 'correct execution' of watermark detection. Implements constraints for mapping, random number generation, comparison, and summation.

Result: Implemented multiple variants covering 3 watermarking schemes, 3 hash functions, and 4 ZKP protocols. PVMark efficiently enables public verifiability without compromising watermarking performance.

Conclusion: PVMark resolves the trust issue in LLM watermarking by making detection publicly verifiable while keeping keys secret, promising practical deployment.

Abstract: Watermarking schemes for large language models (LLMs) have been proposed to
identify the source of the generated text, mitigating the potential threats
emerged from model theft. However, current watermarking solutions hardly
resolve the trust issue: the non-public watermark detection cannot prove itself
faithfully conducting the detection. We observe that it is attributed to the
secret key mostly used in the watermark detection -- it cannot be public, or
the adversary may launch removal attacks provided the key; nor can it be
private, or the watermarking detection is opaque to the public. To resolve the
dilemma, we propose PVMark, a plugin based on zero-knowledge proof (ZKP),
enabling the watermark detection process to be publicly verifiable by third
parties without disclosing any secret key. PVMark hinges upon the proof of
`correct execution' of watermark detection on which a set of ZKP constraints
are built, including mapping, random number generation, comparison, and
summation. We implement multiple variants of PVMark in Python, Rust and Circom,
covering combinations of three watermarking schemes, three hash functions, and
four ZKP protocols, to show our approach effectively works under a variety of
circumstances. By experimental results, PVMark efficiently enables public
verifiability on the state-of-the-art LLM watermarking schemes yet without
compromising the watermarking performance, promising to be deployed in
practice.

*Dong Huang,Mingzhe Du,Jie M. Zhang,Zheng Lin,Meng Luo,Qianru Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Nexus is a multi-agent framework that generates test oracles through collaborative deliberation, validation, and self-refinement, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can accurately determine whether a function under test behaves as intended for a given input.

Method: Nexus uses a multi-agent framework with four specialist agents representing different testing philosophies. It involves deliberation (collaborative critique and refinement), validation (executing oracles against candidate implementations in sandbox), and self-refinement (debugging failed oracles using runtime errors).

Result: Nexus improves test-level oracle accuracy on LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. It enhances bug detection rate on HumanEval from 90.91% to 95.45% and automated program repair success rate from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Conclusion: Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in test oracle generation, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy and downstream task performance across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Test oracle generation in non-regression testing is a longstanding challenge
in software engineering, where the goal is to produce oracles that can
accurately determine whether a function under test (FUT) behaves as intended
for a given input. In this paper, we introduce Nexus, a novel multi-agent
framework to address this challenge. Nexus generates test oracles by leveraging
a diverse set of specialized agents that synthesize test oracles through a
structured process of deliberation, validation, and iterative self-refinement.
During the deliberation phase, a panel of four specialist agents, each
embodying a distinct testing philosophy, collaboratively critiques and refines
an initial set of test oracles. Then, in the validation phase, Nexus generates
a plausible candidate implementation of the FUT and executes the proposed
oracles against it in a secure sandbox. For any oracle that fails this
execution-based check, Nexus activates an automated selfrefinement loop, using
the specific runtime error to debug and correct the oracle before
re-validation. Our extensive evaluation on seven diverse benchmarks
demonstrates that Nexus consistently and substantially outperforms
state-of-theart baselines. For instance, Nexus improves the test-level oracle
accuracy on the LiveCodeBench from 46.30% to 57.73% for GPT-4.1-Mini. The
improved accuracy also significantly enhances downstream tasks: the bug
detection rate of GPT4.1-Mini generated test oracles on HumanEval increases
from 90.91% to 95.45% for Nexus compared to baselines, and the success rate of
automated program repair improves from 35.23% to 69.32%.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SecureReviewer is an LLM-based approach that enhances automated code review for security issues through secure-aware fine-tuning, RAG integration to reduce hallucinations, and a new SecureBLEU evaluation metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated code review models focus on general-purpose reviews but lack effectiveness in identifying security issues, facing challenges like data scarcity and inadequate evaluation metrics for security-specific reviews.

Method: Constructs a security-focused dataset, fine-tunes LLMs with secure-aware strategy, integrates RAG to ground comments in security knowledge, and introduces SecureBLEU metric for evaluation.

Result: SecureReviewer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in security issue detection accuracy and generates higher quality, more practical review comments.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses limitations in automated security code review through specialized dataset construction, secure-aware fine-tuning, and reliable evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Identifying and addressing security issues during the early phase of the
development lifecycle is critical for mitigating the long-term negative impacts
on software systems. Code review serves as an effective practice that enables
developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase.
To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review
approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly
advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing
models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in
identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.
Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues
faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation
metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new
approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve
security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a
dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities.
Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments
that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with
our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in
LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG
technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security
knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric
designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security
issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the
overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.

Result: Benchmark results show general improvements on public datasets but reveal limitations of existing approaches on the hidden test, highlighting potential for LLM integration.

Conclusion: ORBIT enables consistent and realistic evaluation of recommendation models, exposing current limitations and opportunities for improvement through LLM integration.

Abstract: Recommender systems are among the most impactful AI applications, interacting
with billions of users every day, guiding them to relevant products, services,
or information tailored to their preferences. However, the research and
development of recommender systems are hindered by existing datasets that fail
to capture realistic user behaviors and inconsistent evaluation settings that

ORBIT offers a standardized evaluation framework of public datasets with
reproducible splits and transparent settings for its public leaderboard.
Additionally, ORBIT introduces a new webpage recommendation task, ClueWeb-Reco,
featuring web browsing sequences from 87 million public, high-quality webpages.
ClueWeb-Reco is a synthetic dataset derived from real, user-consented, and

scenarios and is reserved as the hidden test part of our leaderboard to
challenge recommendation models' generalization ability. ORBIT measures 12
representative recommendation models on its public benchmark and introduces a
prompted LLM baseline on the ClueWeb-Reco hidden test. Our benchmark results
reflect general improvements of recommender systems on the public datasets,
with variable individual performances. The results on the hidden test reveal

TL;DR: DARTS is a drone-based AI system for real-time traffic incident detection using thermal imaging and deep learning, achieving 99% accuracy and faster detection than conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional incident detection methods separate detection from verification, lack flexibility, and require dense infrastructure, limiting adaptability to changing incident hotspots.

Method: DARTS integrates drones' mobility and aerial perspective, thermal imaging for low-visibility performance, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection.

Result: Achieved 99% detection accuracy on self-collected dataset, detected rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than traditional methods in field test, and enabled real-time congestion monitoring.

Conclusion: DARTS offers a flexible, integrated approach to traffic incident detection with potential for faster emergency response, proactive traffic control, and scalable deployment in remote areas.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes combining CNN with Vision Transformer for monocular camera self-localization to handle dynamic obstacles better than CNN alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-localization using inexpensive monocular cameras is needed for autonomous driving, but CNN-based methods struggle with dynamic obstacles like people.

Method: Combines CNN (for local features) with Vision Transformer (for global features from image patches) to improve localization accuracy.

Result: Achieved 1.5x higher accuracy improvement in CG datasets with dynamic obstacles, 20.1% smaller error than SOTA on public datasets, and average 7.51cm localization error on robot.

Conclusion: The CNN-Vision Transformer hybrid approach significantly improves self-localization accuracy, especially in dynamic environments, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

*Mirko Usuelli,David Rapado-Rincon,Gert Kootstra,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriGS-SLAM is a Visual-LiDAR SLAM framework that combines LiDAR odometry with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust 3D scene understanding in orchards, handling seasonal changes and foliage motion while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots in orchards need real-time 3D scene understanding despite challenges like repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven foliage motion, requiring robust multimodal perception.

Method: Couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering. Uses batch rasterization across viewpoints to recover structure under occlusions, and a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle to preserve details and bound memory. Pose refinement is guided by probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency.

Result: Delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines across seasons and orchard sites, while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses orchard monitoring challenges and can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring robust multimodal perception.

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and

### [138] [Rethinking Text-to-SQL: Dynamic Multi-turn SQL Interaction for Real-world Database Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26495)
*Linzhuang Sun,Tianyu Guo,Hao Liang,Yuying Li,Qifeng Cai,Jingxuan Wei,Bihui Yu,Wentao Zhang,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DySQL-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL models in dynamic, multi-turn interactive scenarios where user intents evolve, addressing limitations of static single-turn approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL systems perform well on static single-turn tasks but fail in real-world interactive scenarios where users iteratively refine queries based on intermediate results, particularly in domains like finance and business analytics.

Method: Built through an automated two-stage pipeline: task synthesis using structured tree representations from database tables with LLM-based generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation. Also includes a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions among LLM-simulated users, test models, and executable databases.

Result: DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases with 1,072 tasks. Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness. Even GPT-4o achieves only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on Pass@5, demonstrating the benchmark's difficulty.

Conclusion: The benchmark effectively captures the challenges of real-world interactive SQL scenarios and reveals significant performance gaps in current models, highlighting the need for improved dynamic reasoning capabilities in Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-SQL have achieved strong results in static,
single-turn tasks, where models generate SQL queries from natural language
questions. However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive
scenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple
turns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users
iteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate
results. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a
benchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike
previous manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated
two-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree
representations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task
generation, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.
Human evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further
propose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions
among an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.
The model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.
DySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling
1,072 tasks. Even GPT-4o attains only 58.34% overall accuracy and 23.81% on the
Pass@5 metric, underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. All code and data are
released at https://github.com/Aurora-slz/Real-World-SQL-Bench .

TL;DR: Physics-informed deep learning model for group image registration of multiparametric cardiac MRI maps using test-time adaptation to handle misalignment between different contrast-weighted images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misalignment between multiparametric maps (e.g., T1 and T2 mapping) makes pixel-wise analysis challenging in myocardial tissue characterization.

Method: Generalizable physics-informed deep-learning model using test-time adaptation with synthetic images from specific physics models as registration reference, enabling transductive learning for various tissue contrasts.

Result: Validated in healthy volunteers with various MRI sequences, demonstrating improved multi-modal registration performance across wide range of image contrast variability.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses misalignment challenges in multiparametric cardiac MRI mapping through physics-informed deep learning adaptation.

Abstract: Multiparametric mapping MRI has become a viable tool for myocardial tissue
characterization. However, misalignment between multiparametric maps makes
pixel-wise analysis challenging. To address this challenge, we developed a
generalizable physics-informed deep-learning model using test-time adaptation
to enable group image registration across contrast weighted images acquired
from multiple physical models (e.g., a T1 mapping model and T2 mapping model).
The physics-informed adaptation utilized the synthetic images from specific
physics model as registration reference, allows for transductive learning for
various tissue contrast. We validated the model in healthy volunteers with
various MRI sequences, demonstrating its improvement for multi-modal
registration with a wide range of image contrast variability.

### [140] [SPG-CDENet: Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network for Multi-Organ Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26390)
*Xizhi Tian,Changjun Zhou,Yulin. Yang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SPG-CDENet is a two-stage multi-organ segmentation method that uses spatial priors and cross-attention between global and local encoders to handle organ size/shape variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multi-organ segmentation caused by huge variations in organ size and shape that limit effectiveness of existing deep learning methods.

Method: Two-stage approach with spatial prior network for coarse ROI localization and cross dual encoder network with global/local encoders, symmetric cross-attention module, and flow-based decoder for feature fusion and preservation.

Result: Superior performance demonstrated on two public datasets compared to existing segmentation methods, with ablation studies validating effectiveness of proposed modules.

Conclusion: SPG-CDENet effectively improves multi-organ segmentation accuracy through spatial guidance and enhanced feature interaction between global and local contexts.

Abstract: Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image
segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their
effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we
propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel
two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation
accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior
network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse
localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial
guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises
four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric
cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures
global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses
on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the
global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed
across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the
flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the
final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and
utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to
existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate
the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.

*Wondimagegn Abebe Demissie,Stefano Roccella,Rudy Rossetto,Antonio Minnocci,Andrea Vannini,Luca Sebastiani*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of three deep learning models (U-Net, YOLOv11m-seg, Mask R-CNN) for olive tree crown and shadow segmentation in UAV imagery, with biovolume estimation using solar geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Olive tree biovolume estimation is crucial for precision agriculture, yield prediction, and resource management in Mediterranean regions affected by climate stress.

Method: Used three deep learning models on ultra-high resolution UAV imagery with manual annotations, combining crown projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry for biovolume estimation.

Result: Mask R-CNN achieved best accuracy (F1=0.86; mIoU=0.72), YOLOv11m-seg was fastest (0.12s per image), estimated biovolumes ranged 4-24 cubic meters showing structural differences.

Conclusion: Mask R-CNN is best for accuracy-critical applications, YOLOv11m-seg for speed-critical large deployments, U-Net for lightweight high-sensitivity; framework enables scalable orchard monitoring with potential DEM/DSM integration.

Abstract: Olive tree biovolume estimation is a key task in precision agriculture,
supporting yield prediction and resource management, especially in
Mediterranean regions severely impacted by climate-induced stress. This study
presents a comparative analysis of three deep learning models U-Net,
YOLOv11m-seg, and Mask RCNN for segmenting olive tree crowns and their shadows
in ultra-high resolution UAV imagery. The UAV dataset, acquired over
Vicopisano, Italy, includes manually annotated crown and shadow masks. Building
on these annotations, the methodology emphasizes spatial feature extraction and
robust segmentation; per-tree biovolume is then estimated by combining crown
projected area with shadow-derived height using solar geometry. In testing,
Mask R-CNN achieved the best overall accuracy (F1 = 0.86; mIoU = 0.72), while
YOLOv11m-seg provided the fastest throughput (0.12 second per image). The
estimated biovolumes spanned from approximately 4 to 24 cubic meters,
reflecting clear structural differences among trees. These results indicate
Mask R-CNN is preferable when biovolume accuracy is paramount, whereas
YOLOv11m-seg suits large-area deployments where speed is critical; U-Net
remains a lightweight, high-sensitivity option. The framework enables accurate,
scalable orchard monitoring and can be further strengthened with DEM or DSM
integration and field calibration for operational decision support.

*Zhao Wang,Wei Dai,Thuy Thanh Dao,Steffen Bollmann,Hongfu Sun,Craig Engstrom,Shekhar S. Chandra*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAMRI adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for MRI segmentation through efficient fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse anatomical regions with minimal training requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI segmentation is labor-intensive, and existing CNN-based methods struggle with MRI's variable contrast, intensity inhomogeneity, and protocol variations, while current SAM adaptations overlook MRI-specific challenges.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning strategy that adapts SAM to MRI by only training the mask decoder, reducing training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% compared to full-model retraining. Trained on 1.1 million labeled MR slices.

Result: Achieves mean Dice score of 0.87 across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, delivers state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions, and shows robust generalization on unseen structures, especially small and clinically important ones.

Conclusion: SAM can be effectively adapted to MRI through simple fine-tuning of its mask decoder, providing an efficient and highly accurate solution for MRI segmentation that generalizes well across diverse anatomical structures.

Abstract: Accurate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation is crucial for
clinical decision-making, but remains labor-intensive when performed manually.
Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods can be accurate and efficient,
but often generalize poorly to MRI's variable contrast, intensity
inhomogeneity, and protocols. Although the transformer-based Segment Anything
Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable generalizability in natural images,
existing adaptations often treat MRI as another imaging modality, overlooking
these modality-specific challenges. We present SAMRI, an MRI-specialized SAM
trained and validated on 1.1 million labeled MR slices spanning whole-body
organs and pathologies. We demonstrate that SAM can be effectively adapted to
MRI by simply fine-tuning its mask decoder using a two-stage strategy, reducing
training time by 94% and trainable parameters by 96% versus full-model
retraining. Across diverse MRI segmentation tasks, SAMRI achieves a mean Dice
of 0.87, delivering state-of-the-art accuracy across anatomical regions and
robust generalization on unseen structures, particularly small and clinically
important structures.

*Alya Almsouti,Ainur Khamitova,Darya Taratynova,Mohammad Yaqub*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: BRIQA is a method for automated artifact severity assessment in pediatric brain MRI that addresses class imbalance through gradient-based loss reweighting and rotating batching, improving classification performance across multiple artifact types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual quality assessment of pediatric brain MRI artifacts is time-consuming and subjective, especially in low-field systems with reduced signal-to-noise ratio, creating need for robust automated solutions.

Method: BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure consistent exposure to underrepresented classes in artifact severity classification.

Result: BRIQA improved average macro F1 score from 0.659 to 0.706, with significant gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098), Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012) artifact severity classification.

Conclusion: No single architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing architectural diversity importance. Rotating batching with cross-entropy loss promotes balanced learning and improves performance across metrics.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of artifacts in pediatric brain Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is critical for diagnostic accuracy, especially in low-field
systems where the signal-to-noise ratio is reduced. Manual quality assessment
is time-consuming and subjective, motivating the need for robust automated
solutions. In this work, we propose BRIQA (Balanced Reweighting in Image
Quality Assessment), which addresses class imbalance in artifact severity
levels. BRIQA uses gradient-based loss reweighting to dynamically adjust
per-class contributions and employs a rotating batching scheme to ensure
consistent exposure to underrepresented classes. Through experiments, no single
architecture performs best across all artifact types, emphasizing the
importance of architectural diversity. The rotating batching configuration
improves performance across metrics by promoting balanced learning when
combined with cross-entropy loss. BRIQA improves average macro F1 score from
0.659 to 0.706, with notable gains in Noise (0.430), Zipper (0.098),
Positioning (0.097), Contrast (0.217), Motion (0.022), and Banding (0.012)

detection from {\mu}US, along with its first prospective validation. Methods:

encoder that embeds PCa-specific clinical biomarkers. The model generates a
cancer heatmap and a risk score for clinically significant PCa. Following
training on multi-center retrospective data, the model is prospectively
evaluated on data acquired five years later from a new clinical site. Model
predictions are benchmarked against standard clinical scoring protocols
(PRI-MUS and PI-RADS). Results: ProstNFound+ shows strong generalization to the
prospective data, with no performance degradation compared to retrospective

Motivation: Current deep learning methods for CT reconstruction are limited to specific anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization to unseen anatomies and lesions.

Method: Created the Multi-Organ medical image REconstruction (MORE) dataset with CT scans across 9 anatomies and 15 lesion types, and established a strong baseline solution.

Result: The comprehensive dataset improves model generalization capability, and optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen anatomies.

Conclusion: The MORE dataset enables robust training and rigorous evaluation of CT reconstruction models, demonstrating improved generalization through diverse data and optimization-based approaches.

Abstract: CT reconstruction provides radiologists with images for diagnosis and
treatment, yet current deep learning methods are typically limited to specific
anatomies and datasets, hindering generalization ability to unseen anatomies
and lesions. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Organ medical image
REconstruction (MORE) dataset, comprising CT scans across 9 diverse anatomies

training of deep learning models on extensive, heterogeneous data, and (2)
facilitating rigorous evaluation of model generalization for CT reconstruction.
We further establish a strong baseline solution that outperforms prior
approaches under these challenging conditions. Our results demonstrate that:
(1) a comprehensive dataset helps improve the generalization capability of
models, and (2) optimization-based methods offer enhanced robustness for unseen
anatomies. The MORE dataset is freely accessible under CC-BY-NC 4.0 at our

*Xin Hu,Pengfei Xu,Jin Zhou,Hongbo Fu,Hui Huang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: StructLayoutFormer is a Transformer-based approach for conditional structured layout generation that disentangles structural information from element placements, achieving better structured layout generation than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Structured layouts are preferable in 2D visual content but existing data-driven approaches fail to produce explicit layout structures, requiring heavy manual labor for structured layout creation.

Method: Uses structure serialization to represent layouts as sequences and disentangles structural information from element placements using a Transformer-based architecture.

Result: Outperforms existing layout generation approaches with post-processing for structure extraction and effectively extracts and transfers layout structures.

Conclusion: The first data-driven approach that achieves conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout structures explicitly, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Structured layouts are preferable in many 2D visual contents (\eg, GUIs,
webpages) since the structural information allows convenient layout editing.
Computational frameworks can help create structured layouts but require heavy
labor input. Existing data-driven approaches are effective in automatically
generating fixed layouts but fail to produce layout structures. We present
StructLayoutFormer, a novel Transformer-based approach for conditional
structured layout generation. We use a structure serialization scheme to
represent structured layouts as sequences. To better control the structures of
generated layouts, we disentangle the structural information from the element
placements. Our approach is the first data-driven approach that achieves
conditional structured layout generation and produces realistic layout
structures explicitly. We compare our approach with existing data-driven layout
generation approaches by including post-processing for structure extraction.
Extensive experiments have shown that our approach exceeds these baselines in
conditional structured layout generation. We also demonstrate that our approach
is effective in extracting and transferring layout structures. The code is

*Hitomi Jin Ling Tee,Chaoren Wang,Zijie Zhang,Zhizheng Wu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: The paper proposes Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering (SP-MCQA) as a novel subjective evaluation method for TTS intelligibility, revealing that traditional WER metrics fail to capture real-world comprehension needs and showing that even SOTA models have deficiencies in text normalization and phonetic accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TTS intelligibility assessments rely too heavily on word-by-word accuracy metrics like WER, which don't reflect the complexity of real-world speech or human comprehension needs, creating an evaluation bottleneck.

Method: Proposed Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice Question Answering (SP-MCQA) as a subjective approach to evaluate key information accuracy in synthesized speech, and created SP-MCQA-Eval - an 8.76-hour news-style benchmark dataset for this evaluation.

Result: Experiments showed that low WER doesn't guarantee high key-information accuracy, exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility. SP-MCQA revealed that even SOTA models lack robust text normalization and phonetic accuracy.

Conclusion: There's an urgent need for high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria since many systems excel at WER but fall short on real-world intelligibility, and SP-MCQA provides a better alternative for comprehensive assessment.

Abstract: The evaluation of intelligibility for TTS has reached a bottleneck, as
existing assessments heavily rely on word-by-word accuracy metrics such as WER,
which fail to capture the complexity of real-world speech or reflect human
comprehension needs. To address this, we propose Spoken-Passage Multiple-Choice
Question Answering, a novel subjective approach evaluating the accuracy of key
information in synthesized speech, and release SP-MCQA-Eval, an 8.76-hour
news-style benchmark dataset for SP-MCQA evaluation. Our experiments reveal
that low WER does not necessarily guarantee high key-information accuracy,
exposing a gap between traditional metrics and practical intelligibility.
SP-MCQA shows that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still lack robust text
normalization and phonetic accuracy. This work underscores the urgent need for
high-level, more life-like evaluation criteria now that many systems already
excel at WER yet may fall short on real-world intelligibility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC enables continual and compositional knowledge editing in large vision-language models by combining cross-modal evidence retrieval with disentangled parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge editing methods focus on single modalities in isolation, neglecting the multimodal nature of LVLMs and the need for continuous knowledge updates, leading to suboptimal outcomes.

Method: MemEIC uses a hybrid external-internal editor with dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters for disentangled parameter updates per modality, plus a brain-inspired knowledge connector for compositional reasoning.

Result: MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the limitations of single-modality editing by enabling continual and compositional knowledge editing across both visual and textual modalities.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECS is a self-distilled, preference-based cold start framework that decouples multimodal learning to improve generalization before reinforcement learning, outperforming SFT-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT-based cold start methods cause instruction-style overfitting and weaken out-of-distribution generalization, which negatively impacts downstream RL performance.

Method: SPECS uses self-distillation to generate introspective preference data pairs, performs preference-based training focusing on surface-form criteria, and then hands off to RL for deep reasoning.

Result: Experimental results show consistent performance gains, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%, while reducing in-distribution 'stuckness' and improving training stability.

Conclusion: Decoupling multimodal learning through preference-based cold start yields better generalization and higher performance ceilings compared to traditional SFT-based approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Knowledge distillation undermines model debiasing capabilities, with significant variations across bias types, but can be improved through data augmentation, iterative distillation, and teacher weight initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how knowledge distillation affects model robustness against spurious correlations and the transferability of debiasing capabilities from teacher to student models.

Method: Extensive experiments on natural language inference and image classification tasks, analyzing attention patterns and internal circuits that cause distinct behavior post-KD.

Result: KD generally undermines debiasing capability; debiased models don't benefit from teacher knowledge; robustness varies across bias types; identified specific internal mechanisms causing these effects.

Conclusion: Proposed three effective solutions: high-quality data augmentation, iterative knowledge distillation, and teacher weight initialization to improve distillability of debiasing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

TL;DR: CorVS is a novel person identification method that matches visual tracking trajectories with wearable sensor measurements using deep learning to predict correspondence probabilities and reliabilities, enabling robust identification in real-world warehouse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Worker location data is crucial for productivity in industrial sites. While cameras offer valuable environmental context, visual-only identification is impractical. Existing trajectory-sensor matching methods break down under real-world conditions, necessitating a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes CorVS with two main components: 1) A deep learning model that predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for every trajectory-sensor measurement pair, and 2) An algorithm that matches trajectories and sensor measurements over time using these predictions.

Result: The method was validated using a dataset with actual warehouse operations, demonstrating effectiveness for real-world applications.

Conclusion: CorVS provides a robust data-driven solution for person identification in industrial environments by effectively combining visual tracking trajectories with wearable sensor measurements, overcoming limitations of existing methods in real-world conditions.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper challenges the associative view of memory in Transformers and proposes a geometric view, showing that models synthesize global geometric relationships between entities rather than just storing local co-occurrences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Transformer models encode memory beyond simple co-occurrence associations and explore the emergence of geometric representations in parametric memory.

Method: The authors isolate a clean instance of Transformer reasoning, analyze neural embedding geometries, connect to Node2Vec, and demonstrate how geometry stems from spectral bias that arises naturally.

Result: Transformers develop elegant geometric representations of atomic facts that encode global relationships between entities, even when not more efficient than brute-force associations, due to natural spectral bias.

Conclusion: The geometric view of parametric memory should replace default associative intuitions, offering new perspectives for knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning in Transformers.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure how AI research gains translate into actual economic value and automation in practical settings, moving beyond research benchmarks.

Method: Introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI) - a multi-sector benchmark of real-world, economically valuable projects to evaluate end-to-end AI agent performance.

Result: AI agents perform near the floor on RLI, with the highest-performing agent achieving only 2.5% automation rate.

Conclusion: The results provide empirical evidence to ground discussions of AI automation, enabling better tracking of AI impacts and proactive navigation of labor automation.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and
reasoning, but it remains unclear how these gains translate into economic value
and automation. To measure this, we introduce the Remote Labor Index (RLI), a
broadly multi-sector benchmark comprising real-world, economically valuable

*Penghui Qi,Zichen Liu,Xiangxin Zhou,Tianyu Pang,Chao Du,Wee Sun Lee,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using FP16 instead of BF16 in RL fine-tuning of LLMs eliminates numerical mismatch between training and inference, leading to more stable optimization and better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL fine-tuning of LLMs suffers from instability due to numerical mismatch between training and inference policies, which prior work tried to address through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments.

Method: Simply revert from BF16 to FP16 precision for RL fine-tuning, requiring only a few lines of code change without modifying model architecture or learning algorithm.

Result: Using FP16 uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks.

Conclusion: The findings suggest reconsidering precision trade-offs in RL fine-tuning, as FP16 effectively eliminates the numerical mismatch issue caused by BF16's large rounding errors.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

*Zaishuo Xia,Yukuan Lu,Xinyi Li,Yifan Xu,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRWM improves world model performance by enforcing geometric regularization in latent space, leading to more stable long-horizon predictions without requiring larger dynamics modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models degrade over long horizons due to poor representation quality from high-dimensional, lossy, or entangled latent representations that make dynamics learning difficult.

Method: Proposes Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM) that enforce consecutive points along sensory trajectories to remain close in latent space, improving representation alignment with environment topology.

Result: GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, learning latent manifolds with superior geometric structure.

Conclusion: Improving representation learning is a direct and effective path to robust world models, enabling reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging dynamics modules.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-LLM collaborative framework that infers thinking traces from label-only annotations to improve LLM rater reliability for subjective evaluation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used as raters but lack reliability for subjective tasks where human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond simple labels. Thinking traces (the reasoning behind judgments) are informative but difficult to collect.

Method: Uses rejection sampling to reconstruct thinking traces from label-only annotations at scale. These traces are then applied to fine-tune open LLM raters and synthesize clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters.

Result: Significantly improved LLM-human agreement across multiple datasets. Refined annotation guidelines also increased agreement among different LLM models.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as practical proxies for unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance LLM rater reliability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

TL;DR: A framework for aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences by aggregating multiple rubric-conditioned judges using persona-based preference modeling, implemented with GAM and MLP aggregators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based judges are difficult to calibrate and suffer from rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability, which hinders applications like RLHF reward models and model routing systems.

Method: Propose a persona-based framework that learns to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges, with two implementations: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Result: Investigated performance against naive baselines and assessed robustness through case studies on human and LLM-judge biases.

Conclusion: The framework enables modeling diverse persona-based preferences and synthesizing preference labels at scale for better alignment with human preferences.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

TL;DR: Reasoning Curriculum is a two-stage RL approach that first develops reasoning skills in math domains, then transfers them to other domains through joint training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most RL efforts focus only on math and code, but reasoning skills should be transferable across domains for more general problem-solving capabilities.

Method: Two-stage curriculum: Stage 1 performs math-only RL with verifiable rewards, Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate skills.

Result: Consistent gains on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B across multi-domain benchmarks, with both stages being necessary for optimal performance.

Conclusion: The math-first elicitation approach increases cognitive behaviors important for complex problem solving, providing a compact recipe for general reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

TL;DR: ToolRM is a family of lightweight generative reward models for tool-use scenarios, trained on a novel pairwise preference dataset and achieving superior performance in function-calling tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of specialized reward models for function-calling tasks in tool learning has limited progress in developing more capable agentic AI systems.

Method: Proposed a novel pipeline using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling to construct ToolPref-Pairwise-30K dataset, then trained lightweight generative RMs on this data.

Result: ToolRM models achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy than frontier models like Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward judgments, and reduce output token usage by over 66% in inference-time scaling.

Conclusion: ToolRM enables effective reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback and generalizes to broader critique tasks, providing a foundation for advancing tool-learning capabilities.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: Context engineering helps machines understand human situations and purposes by examining how contexts shape interactions, tracing its evolution from early human-computer interaction to modern AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how machines can better understand human situations and purposes, building on Marx's insight that human essence is shaped by social relations, now extended to human-machine interactions.

Method: Provides a systematic definition of context engineering, outlines its historical evolution through distinct phases based on machine intelligence levels, and examines key design considerations.

Result: Establishes a conceptual foundation for context engineering, tracing its development over 20+ years from early HCI frameworks to current human-agent interaction paradigms.

Conclusion: Context engineering is a crucial foundation for AI systems, with promising future directions toward human-level or superhuman intelligence, serving as a stepping stone for systematic AI development.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistencies in normative reasoning despite generally following valid patterns, exhibiting human-like cognitive biases in deontic modality tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in normative reasoning involving obligation and permission, which remains underexplored compared to other reasoning tasks.

Method: Created a new dataset covering formal reasoning patterns in normative and epistemic domains, comparing LLMs' performance between normative modals and structurally similar epistemic modals while incorporating cognitive factors from human reasoning studies.

Result: LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns but show notable inconsistencies in specific normative reasoning types and display cognitive biases similar to those found in human reasoning studies.

Conclusion: The findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability in handling deontic modality.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

Motivation: To enable agentic organizations where AI agents collaboratively solve complex problems beyond individual capabilities through concurrent reasoning.

Method: A thinking protocol with an organizer dynamically assigning sub-queries to workers, merging intermediate knowledge, and optimizing thinking structures through reinforcement learning.

Result: 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking with improved accuracy on mathematical reasoning tasks, plus generalization to unseen tasks without additional training.

Conclusion: AsyncThink enables efficient collaborative problem-solving through concurrent reasoning structures that can be optimized and generalized across tasks.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To comprehensively evaluate reasoning capabilities of contemporary foundation models across different computational infrastructures and establish reliable benchmarks for longitudinal tracking.

Method: Three-phase experimental approach: baseline establishment on HPC supercomputer, infrastructure validation on university cluster and cloud platform, and extended evaluation across 79 problems spanning 8 academic domains.

Result: Findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable guidelines for model selection across different contexts.

Conclusion: The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable reliable longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve, with practical implications for educational, production, and research applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.
