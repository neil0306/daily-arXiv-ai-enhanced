Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations.

The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers.

This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts.

We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.", "AI": {"tldr": "COM4D is a method for reconstructing complete 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects from monocular videos, using only static multi-object or dynamic single-object supervision without requiring 4D compositional training data.", "motivation": "Existing methods focus on single objects and rely on category-specific parametric models, leading to inconsistent scene configurations and being limited to modeled categories.

So much so that many wonder how close humanity is to developing an A.I. model that can achieve human level of intelligence, also known as artificial general intelligence (A.G.I.). In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation.

This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218.

We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "AVP is an active video perception framework that uses MLLM agents to iteratively plan, observe, and reflect on video content, achieving state-of-the-art performance on LVU benchmarks with significantly reduced computational costs.", "motivation": "Current LVU agentic frameworks use query-agnostic captioners that waste computation on irrelevant content and lose fine-grained temporal/spatial information.

However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles.

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules.
