### [1] [Noise or Nuance: An Investigation Into Useful Information and Filtering For LLM Driven AKBC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08903)
*Alex Clay,Ernesto Jiménez-Ruiz,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of triple completion task in constrained LLM settings, focusing on generation quality, filtering poor outputs, and response parsing tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of improving LLM outputs in constrained environments like the 2025 LM-KBC challenge where RAG and fine-tuning are restricted.

Method: Investigated three aspects: generation techniques, quality assurance through LLM filtering, and response parsing approaches in constrained settings.

Result: Found that additional information improves generation quality, LLMs can effectively filter poor quality triples, and response parsing involves a tradeoff between flexibility and consistency that depends on the specific setting.

Conclusion: In constrained LLM environments, strategic use of additional information, LLM-based filtering, and context-aware response parsing can significantly improve triple completion performance despite limitations on standard enhancement techniques.

Abstract: RAG and fine-tuning are prevalent strategies for improving the quality of LLM
outputs. However, in constrained situations, such as that of the 2025 LM-KBC
challenge, such techniques are restricted. In this work we investigate three
facets of the triple completion task: generation, quality assurance, and LLM
response parsing. Our work finds that in this constrained setting: additional
information improves generation quality, LLMs can be effective at filtering
poor quality triples, and the tradeoff between flexibility and consistency with
LLM response parsing is setting dependent.

### [2] [Automated Evidence Extraction and Scoring for Corporate Climate Policy Engagement: A Multilingual RAG Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08907)
*Imene Kolli,Ario Saeid Vaghefi,Chiara Colesanti Senni,Shantam Raj,Markus Leippold*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI-assisted framework using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate evidence extraction from corporate climate policy documents, showing best performance with layout-aware parsing and few-shot prompting, but requiring human oversight for accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current manual assessment of corporate climate policy engagement is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and error-prone, necessitating automation to scale monitoring of over 500 companies and 250 industry associations.

Method: Leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation with layout-aware parsing, Nomic embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies to extract and classify evidence from multilingual corporate documents.

Result: The automated RAG system effectively accelerates evidence extraction and classification from large-scale textual data, with the combination of layout-aware parsing, Nomic embeddings, and few-shot prompting yielding best performance.

Conclusion: While the automated system accelerates evidence extraction, the nuanced analysis requires a human-in-the-loop approach where AI augments rather than replaces expert judgment to ensure accuracy in climate policy engagement assessment.

Abstract: InfluenceMap's LobbyMap Platform monitors the climate policy engagement of
over 500 companies and 250 industry associations, assessing each entity's
support or opposition to science-based policy pathways for achieving the Paris
Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5{\deg}C. Although
InfluenceMap has made progress with automating key elements of the analytical
workflow, a significant portion of the assessment remains manual, making it
time- and labor-intensive and susceptible to human error. We propose an
AI-assisted framework to accelerate the monitoring of corporate climate policy
engagement by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation to automate the most
time-intensive extraction of relevant evidence from large-scale textual data.
Our evaluation shows that a combination of layout-aware parsing, the Nomic
embedding model, and few-shot prompting strategies yields the best performance
in extracting and classifying evidence from multilingual corporate documents.
We conclude that while the automated RAG system effectively accelerates
evidence extraction, the nuanced nature of the analysis necessitates a
human-in-the-loop approach where the technology augments, rather than replaces,
expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

### [3] [Documents Are People and Words Are Items: A Psychometric Approach to Textual Data with Contextual Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08920)
*Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel method using LLMs to transform text into psychometric data by treating documents as individuals and words as items, enabling factor analysis to uncover latent dimensions in textual corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a psychometric approach for analyzing textual data that can uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns, particularly useful for fields rich in textual information like education, psychology, and law.

Method: Two-stage process: 1) Use NLP and transformer models to identify keywords and generate contextual scores, 2) Apply factor analysis (exploratory and bifactor models) to extract latent factors, determine correlations, and identify significant word-factor associations.

Result: Successful application to Wiki STEM corpus demonstrated the method's ability to uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data.

Conclusion: This approach enhances psychometric analysis of textual data and shows promise for various applications in text-rich fields by providing a natural psychometric interpretation of documents and words.

Abstract: This research introduces a novel psychometric method for analyzing textual
data using large language models. By leveraging contextual embeddings to create
contextual scores, we transform textual data into response data suitable for
psychometric analysis. Treating documents as individuals and words as items,
this approach provides a natural psychometric interpretation under the
assumption that certain keywords, whose contextual meanings vary significantly
across documents, can effectively differentiate documents within a corpus. The
modeling process comprises two stages: obtaining contextual scores and
performing psychometric analysis. In the first stage, we utilize natural
language processing techniques and encoder based transformer models to identify
common keywords and generate contextual scores. In the second stage, we employ
various types of factor analysis, including exploratory and bifactor models, to
extract and define latent factors, determine factor correlations, and identify
the most significant words associated with each factor. Applied to the Wiki
STEM corpus, our experimental results demonstrate the method's potential to
uncover latent knowledge dimensions and patterns within textual data. This
approach not only enhances the psychometric analysis of textual data but also
holds promise for applications in fields rich in textual information, such as
education, psychology, and law.

### [4] [BRoverbs -- Measuring how much LLMs understand Portuguese proverbs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08960)
*Thales Sales Almeida,Giovana Kerche Bonás,João Guilherme Alves Santos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRoverbs is a new Portuguese-language dataset using Brazilian proverbs to evaluate LLM performance, addressing limitations of translated datasets and existing Portuguese benchmarks that focus mainly on exams or sentiment analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluations for Portuguese are limited, often using translated datasets that miss linguistic nuances and cultural references. Native Portuguese datasets focus too narrowly on exams and sentiment analysis, leaving gaps in broader linguistic understanding.

Method: Created BRoverbs dataset specifically designed with Brazilian proverbs to assess LLM performance. Proverbs provide rich linguistic resources with cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex syntactic structures that challenge model comprehension of regional expressions.

Result: A new evaluation benchmark for Portuguese-language LLMs that captures regional linguistic and cultural nuances through native Brazilian proverbs, available publicly on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: BRoverbs provides a valuable tool for advancing regionally informed benchmarking of LLMs in Portuguese, addressing the gap in culturally-aware evaluation frameworks for specific linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant performance variations
depending on the linguistic and cultural context in which they are applied.
This disparity signals the necessity of mature evaluation frameworks that can
assess their capabilities in specific regional settings. In the case of
Portuguese, existing evaluations remain limited, often relying on translated
datasets that may not fully capture linguistic nuances or cultural references.
Meanwhile, native Portuguese-language datasets predominantly focus on
structured national exams or sentiment analysis of social media interactions,
leaving gaps in evaluating broader linguistic understanding. To address this
limitation, we introduce BRoverbs, a dataset specifically designed to assess
LLM performance through Brazilian proverbs. Proverbs serve as a rich linguistic
resource, encapsulating cultural wisdom, figurative expressions, and complex
syntactic structures that challenge the model comprehension of regional
expressions. BRoverbs aims to provide a new evaluation tool for
Portuguese-language LLMs, contributing to advancing regionally informed
benchmarking. The benchmark is available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Tropic-AI/BRoverbs.

### [5] [Can Vision-Language Models Solve Visual Math Equations?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09013)
*Monjoy Narayan Choudhury,Junling Wang,Yifan Hou,Mrinmaya Sachan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual equation solving due to counting bottlenecks and multi-step reasoning challenges, despite strong performance on text-based equations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why Vision-Language Models (VLMs) fail at tasks requiring integrated perception and symbolic computation, specifically visual equation solving where equations are embedded in images with object icons as variables.

Method: Decomposed visual equation solving into coefficient counting and variable recognition components, analyzed performance on both textual and visual equations, and examined how equation complexity affects reasoning capabilities.

Result: VLMs perform well on textual equations but fail on visual counterparts. Counting is the primary bottleneck, and composing recognition with reasoning introduces additional errors. Symbolic reasoning itself becomes limiting as equation complexity increases.

Conclusion: Current VLMs have key weaknesses in visually grounded mathematical reasoning, particularly in counting and multi-step visual reasoning, pointing to areas needing future improvement.

Abstract: Despite strong performance in visual understanding and language-based
reasoning, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with tasks requiring
integrated perception and symbolic computation. We study this limitation
through visual equation solving, where mathematical equations are embedded in
images, variables are represented by object icons, and coefficients must be
inferred by counting. While VLMs perform well on textual equations, they fail
on visually grounded counterparts. To understand this gap, we decompose the
task into coefficient counting and variable recognition, and find that counting
is the primary bottleneck, even when recognition is accurate. We also observe
that composing recognition and reasoning introduces additional errors,
highlighting challenges in multi-step visual reasoning. Finally, as equation
complexity increases, symbolic reasoning itself becomes a limiting factor.
These findings reveal key weaknesses in current VLMs and point toward future
improvements in visually grounded mathematical reasoning.

### [6] [Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043)
*Thomas Manuel Rost,Martina Figlia,Bernd Wallraff*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SPICE is a simple diagnostic signal that measures LLM willingness to continue interactions based on user tone, showing strong discrimination between friendly (97.5% continue), unclear (60.4%), and abusive (17.9%) interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a low-overhead, reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions by measuring their relational preferences for continued engagement with users.

Method: Tested 4 open-weight chat models using a 3-tone (friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set across 4 framing conditions (480 trials total), asking YES/NO questions about willingness to re-engage.

Result: SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone, remains statistically robust under multiple tests, provides distinct signal from abuse classification, and shows context-dependent effects based on presentation format.

Conclusion: SPICE is validated as a robust, low-overhead tool for auditing model dispositions that complements existing metrics with direct relational signals.

Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued
Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large
Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a
user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone
(friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four
open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480
trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone.
Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5%
YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue
(17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This
core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical
tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse
classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still
overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the
time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a
preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under
ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text
rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust,
low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions,
complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a
model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support
replication.

*Piyush Pant*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SFT+DPO combined approach outperforms individual SFT or DPO methods for improving safety and helpfulness of OPT-350M model across all evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the effectiveness of different alignment techniques (SFT, DPO, and their combination) for improving language model safety and helpfulness, and to understand how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment.

Method: Trained and evaluated four OPT-350M models: base model, SFT-only, DPO-only, and combined SFT+DPO using Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset. Introduced three evaluation metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and Combined Alignment Score (CAS) from reward model outputs.

Result: SFT outperformed DPO individually, but the combined SFT+DPO model achieved the best performance across all metrics (HmR, HpR, CAS). The study also identified challenges with noisy data, limited GPU resources, and training constraints.

Conclusion: SFT and DPO techniques are complementary, with their combination providing superior alignment results. The research provides a foundation for developing more robust alignment pipelines and highlights practical implementation challenges.

Abstract: This research investigates the effectiveness of alignment techniques,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and a
combined SFT+DPO approach on improving the safety and helpfulness of the
OPT-350M language model. Utilizing the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless RLHF dataset,
we train and evaluate four models: the base OPT350M, an SFT model, a DPO model,
and a model trained with both SFT and DPO. We introduce three key evaluation
metrics: Harmlessness Rate (HmR), Helpfulness Rate (HpR), and a Combined
Alignment Score (CAS), all derived from reward model outputs. The results show
that while SFT outperforms DPO, The combined SFT+DPO model outperforms all
others across all metrics, demonstrating the complementary nature of these
techniques. Our findings also highlight challenges posed by noisy data, limited
GPU resources, and training constraints. This study offers a comprehensive view
of how fine-tuning strategies affect model alignment and provides a foundation
for more robust alignment pipelines in future work.

### [8] [MR-UIE: Multi-Perspective Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning for Universal Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09082)
*Zhongqiu Li,Shiquan Wang,Ruiyu Fang,Mengjiao Bao,Zhenhe Wu,Shuangyong Song,Yongxiang Li,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MR-UIE integrates reinforcement learning with multi-perspective reasoning to enhance LLMs' information extraction capabilities, transforming them from passive extractors to active reasoners that outperform state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong capabilities but underperform in universal information extraction (UIE), especially with complex schema descriptions and multi-step reasoning requirements. Existing approaches like in-context learning and instruction tuning have significant limitations in generalization.

Method: Proposed MR-UIE framework that integrates reinforcement learning with multi-perspective reasoning for information extraction tasks, enabling LLMs to understand both what to extract and how to reason through the extraction process.

Result: Experiments on multiple IE benchmarks show MR-UIE consistently improves extraction accuracy across domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets. Multi-perspective reasoning significantly enhances generalization in complex IE tasks.

Conclusion: The integration of reinforcement learning with multi-perspective reasoning transforms LLMs into active reasoners, demonstrating the critical role of reasoning in challenging information extraction scenarios and achieving superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust capabilities across diverse
research domains. However, their performance in universal information
extraction (UIE) remains insufficient, especially when tackling structured
output scenarios that involve complex schema descriptions and require
multi-step reasoning. While existing approaches enhance the performance of LLMs
through in-context learning and instruction tuning, significant limitations
nonetheless persist. To enhance the model's generalization ability, we propose
integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with multi-perspective reasoning for
information extraction (IE) tasks. Our work transitions LLMs from passive
extractors to active reasoners, enabling them to understand not only what to
extract but also how to reason. Experiments conducted on multiple IE benchmarks
demonstrate that MR-UIE consistently elevates extraction accuracy across
domains and surpasses state-of-the-art methods on several datasets.
Furthermore, incorporating multi-perspective reasoning into RL notably enhances
generalization in complex IE tasks, underscoring the critical role of reasoning
in challenging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First dedicated Bangla code LLMs (1B & 9B) with comprehensive datasets, evaluation benchmark, and ~11-18% performance gains over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bangla is the 5th most spoken language but severely underrepresented in code generation LLMs due to scarcity of high-quality training data.

Method: Created comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets, developed MBPP-Bangla evaluation benchmark, and built TigerCoder-family models through programming domain adaptation.

Result: Achieved significant 11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and general-purpose Bangla LLMs.

Conclusion: Curated high-quality datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages; all resources open-sourced to advance Bangla LLM research.

Abstract: Despite being the 5th most spoken language, Bangla remains underrepresented
in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly for code generation. This
primarily stems from the scarcity of high-quality data to pre-train and/or
finetune such models. Hence, we introduce the first dedicated family of Code
LLMs for Bangla (1B & 9B). We offer three major contributions: (1) a
comprehensive Bangla code instruction datasets for programming domain
adaptation; (2) MBPP-Bangla, an evaluation benchmark for Bangla code
generation; and (3) the TigerCoder-family of Code LLMs, achieving significant
~11-18% performance gains at Pass@1 over existing multilingual and
general-purpose Bangla LLMs. Our findings show that curated, high-quality
datasets can overcome limitations of smaller models for low-resource languages.
We open-source all resources to advance further Bangla LLM research.

### [10] [Compass-v3: Scaling Domain-Specific LLMs for Multilingual E-Commerce in Southeast Asia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09121)
*Sophia Maria*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compass-v3 is a 245B parameter Mixture-of-Experts model specifically designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce, achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient hardware optimizations and outperforming major LLMs like GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3.1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with specialized e-commerce tasks due to noisy, heterogeneous, multilingual, and dynamic data characteristics. E-commerce requires domain-specific knowledge that general LLMs lack.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts architecture with 245B total parameters (71B active per token), fewer but larger experts, hardware-efficient optimizations (intra-node expert parallelism, custom memcpy), trained on 12T tokens of curated multilingual corpora and synthetic e-commerce instructions with mixed-training strategy. Introduces Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO) for better alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1, GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Demonstrates strong multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages and Portuguese while maintaining competitive general benchmark performance. Already deployed in Shopee's platform, replacing over 70% of OpenAI's traffic.

Conclusion: Compass-v3 successfully addresses the challenges of e-commerce domain specialization through its MoE architecture, efficient optimizations, and novel OTPO alignment method, proving effective for real-world industrial applications while maintaining broad linguistic competence.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general-domain applications, yet their
performance often degrades in specialized tasks requiring domain-specific
knowledge. E-commerce is particularly challenging, as its data are noisy,
heterogeneous, multilingual, and highly dynamic. We present Compass-v3, a
vertical-domain Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 245B total parameters and
71B active per token, designed for Southeast Asian e-commerce. Compass-v3
adopts fewer but larger experts, combined with hardware-efficient
optimizations-such as intra-node expert parallelism and a customized memcpy
operator-to maximize GPU utilization. The model is trained on 12T tokens of
curated multilingual corpora and large-scale synthetic e-commerce instructions
using a mixed-training strategy. To enhance alignment, we propose
Optimal-Transport Direct Preference Optimization (OTPO), which captures
token-level distinctions and improves instruction adherence in
commerce-specific scenarios. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Compass-v3
delivers state-of-the-art e-commerce performance, surpassing DeepSeek-V3.1,
GPT-4 series, and Qwen3-235B. Moreover, Compass-v3 demonstrates strong
multilingual capability across low-resource Southeast Asian languages
(Indonesian, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Malay, Taglog) and Portuguese while
sustaining competitive performance on general benchmarks. It has already been
widely applied in Shopee's industrial-scale e-commerce platform and is
gradually replacing OpenAI's traffic, now accounting for over 70\% of total LLM
usage, highlighting its dual strengths in specialized commerce expertise and
broad linguistic competence.

Motivation: To reduce the time and effort required for manual coding of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs) in educational dialogue analysis.

Method: Used GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models with tailored prompts on the open-source CIMA corpus containing pre-annotated tutor responses across four DA categories.

Result: GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, weighted F1-score of 0.81, and Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, indicating substantial agreement with human annotations and surpassing baseline performance.

Conclusion: Generative AI shows strong potential for efficient DA classification in educational dialogue, with importance on task-specific label definitions and contextual information, while highlighting ethical considerations for responsible AI use.

Abstract: This study explores the use of generative AI for automating the
classification of tutors' Dialogue Acts (DAs), aiming to reduce the time and
effort required by traditional manual coding. This case study uses the
open-source CIMA corpus, in which tutors' responses are pre-annotated into four
DA categories. Both GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models were tested using tailored
prompts. Results show that GPT-4 achieved 80% accuracy, a weighted F1-score of
0.81, and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.74, surpassing baseline performance and
indicating substantial agreement with human annotations. These findings suggest
that generative AI has strong potential to provide an efficient and accessible
approach to DA classification, with meaningful implications for educational
dialogue analysis. The study also highlights the importance of task-specific
label definitions and contextual information in enhancing the quality of
automated annotation. Finally, it underscores the ethical considerations
associated with the use of generative AI and the need for responsible and
transparent research practices. The script of this research is publicly

Vietnamese language. Built on the BGE-M3 encoder and enhanced with the
Blockwise Parallel Transformer, ViRanker addresses the lack of competitive
rerankers for Vietnamese, a low-resource language with complex syntax and
diacritics. The model was trained on an 8 GB curated corpus and fine-tuned with
hybrid hard-negative sampling to strengthen robustness. Evaluated on the
MMARCO-VI benchmark, ViRanker achieves strong early-rank accuracy, surpassing
multilingual baselines and competing closely with PhoRanker. By releasing the
model openly on Hugging Face, we aim to support reproducibility and encourage
wider adoption in real-world retrieval systems. Beyond Vietnamese, this study
illustrates how careful architectural adaptation and data curation can advance
reranking in other underrepresented languages.

### [13] [LITcoder: A General-Purpose Library for Building and Comparing Encoding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09152)
*Taha Binhuraib,Ruimin Gao,Anna A. Ivanova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LITcoder is an open-source library for building and benchmarking neural encoding models that provides standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli with brain data, implementing a modular pipeline with various methodological choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To lower technical barriers to encoding model implementation, facilitate systematic comparisons across models and datasets, foster methodological rigor, and accelerate development of high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

Method: Provides a flexible backend with standardized tools for stimulus-brain data alignment, feature transformation, mapping features to brain data, and model evaluation. Implements modular pipeline covering brain datasets, regions, stimulus features, downsampling approaches, with built-in logging, plotting, and integration with experiment tracking platforms.

Result: Demonstrated scalability and versatility by fitting encoding models to three story listening datasets. Identified critical methodological choices including accounting for all tokens in TR scans, incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using proper train-test splits, and accounting for head motion effects.

Conclusion: LITcoder successfully provides a comprehensive framework that enables researchers to easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core infrastructure, making neural encoding model development more accessible and rigorous.

Abstract: We introduce LITcoder, an open-source library for building and benchmarking
neural encoding models. Designed as a flexible backend, LITcoder provides
standardized tools for aligning continuous stimuli (e.g., text and speech) with
brain data, transforming stimuli into representational features, mapping those
features onto brain data, and evaluating the predictive performance of the
resulting model on held-out data. The library implements a modular pipeline
covering a wide array of methodological design choices, so researchers can
easily compose, compare, and extend encoding models without reinventing core
infrastructure. Such choices include brain datasets, brain regions, stimulus
feature (both neural-net-based and control, such as word rate), downsampling
approaches, and many others. In addition, the library provides built-in
logging, plotting, and seamless integration with experiment tracking platforms
such as Weights & Biases (W&B). We demonstrate the scalability and versatility
of our framework by fitting a range of encoding models to three story listening
datasets: LeBel et al. (2023), Narratives, and Little Prince. We also explore
the methodological choices critical for building encoding models for continuous
fMRI data, illustrating the importance of accounting for all tokens in a TR
scan (as opposed to just taking the last one, even when contextualized),
incorporating hemodynamic lag effects, using train-test splits that minimize
information leakage, and accounting for head motion effects on encoding model
predictivity. Overall, LITcoder lowers technical barriers to encoding model
implementation, facilitates systematic comparisons across models and datasets,
fosters methodological rigor, and accelerates the development of high-quality
high-performance predictive models of brain activity.

### [14] [Target-oriented Multimodal Sentiment Classification with Counterfactual-enhanced Debiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09160)
*Zhiyue Liu,Fanrong Ma,Xin Ling*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework for target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification that reduces spurious correlations between text features and labels by generating counterfactual samples and using adaptive contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods over-rely on textual content and fail to address dataset biases, particularly word-level contextual biases, leading to spurious correlations that impair classification accuracy.

Method: Proposes a counterfactual data augmentation strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features to generate detail-matched image-text samples, combined with an adaptive debiasing contrastive learning mechanism to learn robust features and mitigate biased word influence.

Result: Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: The counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework effectively reduces spurious correlations and improves target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification performance.

Abstract: Target-oriented multimodal sentiment classification seeks to predict
sentiment polarity for specific targets from image-text pairs. While existing
works achieve competitive performance, they often over-rely on textual content
and fail to consider dataset biases, in particular word-level contextual
biases. This leads to spurious correlations between text features and output
labels, impairing classification accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel
counterfactual-enhanced debiasing framework to reduce such spurious
correlations. Our framework incorporates a counterfactual data augmentation
strategy that minimally alters sentiment-related causal features, generating
detail-matched image-text samples to guide the model's attention toward content
tied to sentiment. Furthermore, for learning robust features from
counterfactual data and prompting model decisions, we introduce an adaptive
debiasing contrastive learning mechanism, which effectively mitigates the
influence of biased words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EchoX is a speech-to-speech LLM that bridges the acoustic-semantic gap using semantic representations and dynamic speech target generation, preserving reasoning capabilities while achieving state-of-the-art performance on knowledge QA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLLMs derived from text LLMs suffer from degraded knowledge and reasoning capabilities due to failure to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in feature representation space.

Method: Proposes EchoX which leverages semantic representations and dynamically generates speech training targets, integrating both acoustic and semantic learning.

Result: EchoX achieves advanced performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks using about six thousand hours of training data.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges the acoustic-semantic gap, enabling speech LLMs to preserve strong reasoning abilities while maintaining speech capabilities.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech large language models (SLLMs) are attracting increasing
attention. Derived from text-based large language models (LLMs), SLLMs often
exhibit degradation in knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We hypothesize
that this limitation arises because current training paradigms for SLLMs fail
to bridge the acoustic-semantic gap in the feature representation space. To
address this issue, we propose EchoX, which leverages semantic representations
and dynamically generates speech training targets. This approach integrates
both acoustic and semantic learning, enabling EchoX to preserve strong
reasoning abilities as a speech LLM. Experimental results demonstrate that
EchoX, with about six thousand hours of training data, achieves advanced
performance on multiple knowledge-based question-answering benchmarks. The

### [16] [Efficient Trie-based Biasing using K-step Prediction for Rare Word Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09196)
*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi yip*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a look-ahead multi-step prediction method for ASR contextual biasing that eliminates the need for computationally expensive bonus revocation in Trie-based approaches, achieving significant WER reduction on rare words.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Trie-based biasing in ASR requires computationally expensive revocation of bonus scores when rare words aren't fully recognized, especially problematic for large decoder models during beam search.

Method: Adapts ASR models to look ahead and predict multiple steps simultaneously, fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic data to better estimate if partial hypotheses will lead to full rare word generation.

Result: Reduces word error rate on NSC Part 2 test set from 30.86% to 12.19%, demonstrating substantial improvement in rare word recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed look-ahead multi-step prediction approach effectively overcomes computational limitations of traditional Trie-based biasing while significantly improving rare word recognition performance in ASR systems.

Abstract: Contextual biasing improves rare word recognition of ASR models by
prioritizing the output of rare words during decoding. A common approach is
Trie-based biasing, which gives "bonus scores" to partial hypothesis (e.g.
"Bon") that may lead to the generation of the rare word (e.g. "Bonham"). If the
full word ("Bonham") isn't ultimately recognized, the system revokes those
earlier bonuses. This revocation is limited to beam search and is
computationally expensive, particularly for models with large decoders. To
overcome these limitations, we propose adapting ASR models to look ahead and
predict multiple steps at once. This avoids the revocation step entirely by
better estimating whether a partial hypothesis will lead to the generation of
the full rare word. By fine-tuning Whisper with only 10 hours of synthetic
data, our method reduces the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from
30.86% to 12.19%.

*Chin Yuen Kwok,Jia Qi Yip,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposed keyword-aware loss function for contextual biasing in ASR to improve rare word recognition, reducing WER from 29.71% to 11.81% on synthetic data adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare word recognition in ASR can be improved with synthetic data and contextual biasing, but synthetic data training leads to overfitting due to audio artifacts.

Method: Enhanced TCPGen-based contextual biasing with keyword-aware loss function including masked cross-entropy for biased word prediction and binary classification for detecting biased word positions.

Result: Adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data reduced word error rate on NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to 11.81%.

Conclusion: The proposed keyword-aware loss function effectively addresses overfitting in synthetic data training and significantly improves rare word recognition through complementary training objectives.

Abstract: Rare word recognition can be improved by adapting ASR models to synthetic
data that includes these words. Further improvements can be achieved through
contextual biasing, which trains and adds a biasing module into the model
architecture to prioritize rare words. While training the module on synthetic
rare word data is more effective than using non-rare-word data, it can lead to
overfitting due to artifacts in the synthetic audio. To address this, we
enhance the TCPGen-based contextual biasing approach and propose a
keyword-aware loss function that additionally focuses on biased words when
training biasing modules. This loss includes a masked cross-entropy term for
biased word prediction and a binary classification term for detecting biased
word positions. These two terms complementarily support the decoding of biased
words during inference. By adapting Whisper to 10 hours of synthetic data, our
method reduced the word error rate on the NSC Part 2 test set from 29.71% to
11.81%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GmSLM is a spoken language model pipeline optimized for marmoset monkey vocal communication, using unsupervised data and outperforming human-speech baselines in generating realistic vocalizations and distinguishing real vs artificial conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marmoset monkeys show complex vocal communication similar to human speech features, offering a unique opportunity to study brain activity related to vocal communication since human brain access is difficult. Their vocal-based communication requires specialized modeling approaches.

Method: Developed Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM) pipeline with novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data and weakly labeled conversational data. Compared against human-speech-based baselines.

Result: GmSLM generated vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically, performed well on downstream tasks, and effectively distinguished real from artificial conversations despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: GmSLM provides a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity, benefiting future neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary biology research by enabling further investigation of the neural basis of vocal communication.

Abstract: Marmoset monkeys exhibit complex vocal communication, challenging the view
that nonhuman primates vocal communication is entirely innate, and show similar
features of human speech, such as vocal labeling of others and turn-taking.
Studying their vocal communication offers a unique opportunity to link it with
brain activity-especially given the difficulty of accessing the human brain in
speech and language research. Since Marmosets communicate primarily through
vocalizations, applying standard LLM approaches is not straightforward. We
introduce Generative Marmoset Spoken Language Modeling (GmSLM), an optimized
spoken language model pipeline for Marmoset vocal communication. We designed a
novel zero-shot evaluation metrics using unsupervised in-the-wild data,
alongside weakly labeled conversational data, to assess GmSLM and demonstrate
its advantage over a basic human-speech-based baseline. GmSLM generated
vocalizations closely matched real resynthesized samples acoustically and
performed well on downstream tasks. Despite being fully unsupervised, GmSLM
effectively distinguish real from artificial conversations and may support
further investigations of the neural basis of vocal communication and provides
a practical framework linking vocalization and brain activity. We believe GmSLM
stands to benefit future work in neuroscience, bioacoustics, and evolutionary
biology. Samples are provided under: pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/GmSLM.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCF is a context compression framework that enables efficient long-context modeling through hierarchical latent representations and semantic aggregation, achieving competitive performance with high compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential but computationally expensive. Naive context extension imposes significant computational and memory burdens, leading to inefficiencies in both training and inference.

Method: CCF integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding to form compact representations. It uses a training-efficient optimization strategy with incremental segment decoding and sparse reservoir sampling to reduce memory overhead.

Result: Empirical results show CCF achieves competitive perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context language modeling.

Abstract: Scaling language models to longer contexts is essential for capturing rich
dependencies across extended discourse. However, na\"ive context extension
imposes significant computational and memory burdens, often resulting in
inefficiencies during both training and inference. In this work, we propose
CCF, a novel context compression framework designed to enable efficient
long-context modeling by learning hierarchical latent representations that
preserve global semantics while aggressively reducing input redundancy. CCF
integrates segment-wise semantic aggregation with key-value memory encoding,
forming compact representations that support accurate reconstruction and
long-range understanding. To further enhance scalability, we introduce a
training-efficient optimization strategy that couples incremental segment
decoding with sparse reservoir sampling, substantially reducing memory overhead
without degrading performance. Empirical results on multiple long-context
language modeling benchmarks demonstrate that CCF achieves competitive
perplexity under high compression ratios, and significantly improves throughput
and memory efficiency compared to existing approaches. These findings highlight
the potential of structured compression for scalable and effective long-context
language modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Table QA presents unique challenges due to diverse table structures, sizes, and data types in real-world scenarios, requiring robust methods to handle structured queries over tabular data.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline using LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek v2:16b) for NL-to-SQL conversion, involving example selection, SQL generation, answer extraction, verification, and iterative refinement.

Result: Achieved 70.5% accuracy on DataBench QA and 71.6% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26% and 27% respectively.

Conclusion: LLM-driven Table QA shows strong performance on diverse tabular data, with the multi-stage pipeline approach effectively handling complex structured queries, though limitations remain that require further investigation.

Abstract: Question Answering over Tabular Data (Table QA) presents unique challenges
due to the diverse structure, size, and data types of real-world tables. The
SemEval 2025 Task 8 (DataBench) introduced a benchmark composed of large-scale,
domain-diverse datasets to evaluate the ability of models to accurately answer
structured queries. We propose a Natural Language to SQL (NL-to-SQL) approach
leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and
DeepSeek v2:16b to generate SQL queries dynamically. Our system follows a
multi-stage pipeline involving example selection, SQL query generation, answer
extraction, verification, and iterative refinement. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving 70.5\% accuracy on DataBench QA and
71.6\% on DataBench Lite QA, significantly surpassing baseline scores of 26\%
and 27\% respectively. This paper details our methodology, experimental
results, and alternative approaches, providing insights into the strengths and

*Grazia Sveva Ascione,Nicolò Tamagnone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a weak supervision approach using LLMs and citation data to classify patents according to UN SDGs, overcoming data scarcity and outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The absence of large labeled datasets for patent-to-SDG classification limits supervised learning, while existing methods like keyword searches and citation heuristics lack scalability and generalizability.

Method: Frames patent-to-SDG classification as weak supervision problem using NPL citations as noisy signal. Develops composite labeling function with LLMs to extract structured concepts, computes cross-domain similarity scores, and uses rank-based retrieval with custom positive-only loss calibration.

Result: Creates silver-standard multi-label dataset. Outperforms baselines including transformer models and zero-shot LLM in internal validation. External validation shows greater thematic, cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional classifications.

Conclusion: Weak supervision and semantic alignment can effectively enhance SDG classification at scale, providing a scalable solution for tracking innovation's impact on global challenges.

Abstract: Classifying patents by their relevance to the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs) is crucial for tracking how innovation addresses global
challenges. However, the absence of a large, labeled dataset limits the use of
supervised learning. Existing methods, such as keyword searches, transfer
learning, and citation-based heuristics, lack scalability and generalizability.
This paper frames patent-to-SDG classification as a weak supervision problem,
using citations from patents to SDG-tagged scientific publications (NPL
citations) as a noisy initial signal. To address its sparsity and noise, we
develop a composite labeling function (LF) that uses large language models
(LLMs) to extract structured concepts, namely functions, solutions, and
applications, from patents and SDG papers based on a patent ontology.
Cross-domain similarity scores are computed and combined using a rank-based
retrieval approach. The LF is calibrated via a custom positive-only loss that
aligns with known NPL-SDG links without penalizing discovery of new SDG
associations. The result is a silver-standard, soft multi-label dataset mapping
patents to SDGs, enabling the training of effective multi-label regression
models. We validate our approach through two complementary strategies: (1)
internal validation against held-out NPL-based labels, where our method
outperforms several baselines including transformer-based models, and zero-shot
LLM; and (2) external validation using network modularity in patent citation,
co-inventor, and co-applicant graphs, where our labels reveal greater thematic,
cognitive, and organizational coherence than traditional technological
classifications. These results show that weak supervision and semantic
alignment can enhance SDG classification at scale.

*Channdeth Sok,David Luz,Yacine Haddam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MetaRAG is a metamorphic testing framework for detecting hallucinations in RAG systems through factoid decomposition, mutation testing, and context verification without requiring ground truth or model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hallucination detection methods don't address RAG systems' unique challenges where responses must align with retrieved evidence, creating reliability issues for enterprise deployments.

Method: Four-stage framework: (1) decompose answers into atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations using synonym/antonym substitutions, (3) verify variants against retrieved context, (4) aggregate penalties into hallucination scores.

Result: Effective hallucination detection on proprietary enterprise datasets, enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based conversational agents with identity-aware safeguards.

Conclusion: MetaRAG provides unsupervised, black-box hallucination detection for RAG systems, offering real-time monitoring and identity-sensitive query protection without requiring ground truth references.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in enterprise
applications, yet their reliability remains limited by hallucinations, i.e.,
confident but factually incorrect information. Existing detection approaches,
such as SelfCheckGPT and MetaQA, primarily target standalone LLMs and do not
address the unique challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
where responses must be consistent with retrieved evidence. We therefore
present MetaRAG, a metamorphic testing framework for hallucination detection in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. MetaRAG operates in a real-time,
unsupervised, black-box setting, requiring neither ground-truth references nor
access to model internals, making it suitable for proprietary and high-stakes
domains. The framework proceeds in four stages: (1) decompose answers into
atomic factoids, (2) generate controlled mutations of each factoid using
synonym and antonym substitutions, (3) verify each variant against the
retrieved context (synonyms are expected to be entailed and antonyms
contradicted), and (4) aggregate penalties for inconsistencies into a
response-level hallucination score. Crucially for identity-aware AI, MetaRAG
localizes unsupported claims at the factoid span where they occur (e.g.,
pregnancy-specific precautions, LGBTQ+ refugee rights, or labor eligibility),
allowing users to see flagged spans and enabling system designers to configure
thresholds and guardrails for identity-sensitive queries. Experiments on a
proprietary enterprise dataset illustrate the effectiveness of MetaRAG for
detecting hallucinations and enabling trustworthy deployment of RAG-based
conversational agents. We also outline a topic-based deployment design that
translates MetaRAG's span-level scores into identity-aware safeguards; this
design is discussed but not evaluated in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge cognitive science theories of analogical reasoning with current NLP research, as these cognitive processes are not typically viewed through a cognitive lens in NLP despite their relevance.

Method: Summarizes key cognitive science theories about analogical reasoning processes and relates them to concepts in natural language processing, demonstrating their applicability to major NLP challenges.

Result: Shows that cognitive principles of analogical reasoning are relevant for several major NLP challenges beyond just analogy solving, providing guidance for better relational text understanding.

Conclusion: Cognitive science perspectives on analogical reasoning can guide NLP researchers to optimize relational understanding in text rather than relying heavily on entity-level similarity approaches.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is an essential aspect of human cognition. In this
paper, we summarize key theory about the processes underlying analogical
reasoning from the cognitive science literature and relate it to current
research in natural language processing. While these processes can be easily
linked to concepts in NLP, they are generally not viewed through a cognitive
lens. Furthermore, we show how these notions are relevant for several major
challenges in NLP research, not directly related to analogy solving. This may
guide researchers to better optimize relational understanding in text, as
opposed to relying heavily on entity-level similarity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical approach for dependency graph parsing that can handle complex linguistic phenomena like reentrancies and cycles while maintaining efficiency and reducing computational complexity.

Method: Encodes dependency graphs as sequences using hierarchical bracketing encodings, enabling linear-time parsing with n tagging actions. The method preserves structural information while substantially reducing the label space compared to existing graph linearizations.

Result: Competitive results on a multilingual and multi-formalism benchmark, with consistent improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Conclusion: Hierarchical bracketing encodings provide an effective and efficient approach for dependency graph parsing, offering practical advantages in handling complex linguistic structures while maintaining parsing efficiency.

Abstract: We revisit hierarchical bracketing encodings from a practical perspective in
the context of dependency graph parsing. The approach encodes graphs as
sequences, enabling linear-time parsing with $n$ tagging actions, and still
representing reentrancies, cycles, and empty nodes. Compared to existing graph
linearizations, this representation substantially reduces the label space while
preserving structural information. We evaluate it on a multilingual and

improvements over other methods in exact match accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GrACE is a novel confidence elicitation method for LLMs that uses hidden state similarity to a special token for real-time, scalable confidence estimation without additional sampling or auxiliary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing confidence elicitation methods for LLMs are either computationally expensive or poorly calibrated, making them impractical for real-world deployment in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance.

Method: GrACE uses a special token appended to the vocabulary and measures similarity between the last hidden state and this token's embedding to express confidence. The model is fine-tuned with calibration targets associated with accuracy.

Result: Experiments with three LLMs and two benchmark datasets show GrACE achieves best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks, outperforming six competing methods. It also reduces required samples in test-time scaling.

Conclusion: GrACE provides a practical solution for deploying LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Assessing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by confidence
elicitation is a prominent approach to AI safety in high-stakes applications,
such as healthcare and finance. Existing methods either require expensive
computational overhead or suffer from poor calibration, making them impractical
and unreliable for real-world deployment. In this work, we propose GrACE, a
Generative Approach to Confidence Elicitation that enables scalable and
reliable confidence elicitation for LLMs. GrACE adopts a novel mechanism in
which the model expresses confidence by the similarity between the last hidden
state and the embedding of a special token appended to the vocabulary, in
real-time. We fine-tune the model for calibrating the confidence with
calibration targets associated with accuracy. Experiments with three LLMs and
two benchmark datasets show that the confidence produced by GrACE achieves the
best discriminative capacity and calibration on open-ended generation tasks,
outperforming six competing methods without resorting to additional sampling or
an auxiliary model. Moreover, we propose two strategies for improving test-time
scaling based on confidence induced by GrACE. Experimental results show that
using GrACE not only improves the accuracy of the final decision but also
significantly reduces the number of required samples in the test-time scaling
scheme, indicating the potential of GrACE as a practical solution for deploying
LLMs with scalable, reliable, and real-time confidence estimation.

TL;DR: Self-supervised hybrid architecture combining sentence embeddings with knowledge graphs improves job title matching, with 25% RMSE reduction in high-semantic-relatedness regions through stratified evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional job title matching in resume recommendation systems struggles with limited lexical overlap and misleading terms, requiring better semantic understanding beyond surface similarity.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific knowledge graphs using graph neural networks, evaluated through stratified analysis across low/medium/high semantic relatedness regions.

Result: Fine-tuned SBERT models with KG integration achieved 25% RMSE reduction in high-STR regions compared to strong baselines, showing consistent improvements in semantic alignment.

Conclusion: Combining knowledge graphs with text embeddings provides significant benefits for semantic matching, and stratified evaluation reveals model strengths/weaknesses hidden by global metrics, supporting fair and explainable HR systems.

Abstract: Semantic Textual Relatedness (STR) captures nuanced relationships between
texts that extend beyond superficial lexical similarity. In this study, we
investigate STR in the context of job title matching - a key challenge in
resume recommendation systems, where overlapping terms are often limited or
misleading. We introduce a self-supervised hybrid architecture that combines
dense sentence embeddings with domain-specific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to
improve both semantic alignment and explainability. Unlike previous work that
evaluated models on aggregate performance, our approach emphasizes data
stratification by partitioning the STR score continuum into distinct regions:
low, medium, and high semantic relatedness. This stratified evaluation enables
a fine-grained analysis of model performance across semantically meaningful
subspaces. We evaluate several embedding models, both with and without KG
integration via graph neural networks. The results show that fine-tuned SBERT
models augmented with KGs produce consistent improvements in the high-STR
region, where the RMSE is reduced by 25% over strong baselines. Our findings
highlight not only the benefits of combining KGs with text embeddings, but also
the importance of regional performance analysis in understanding model
behavior. This granular approach reveals strengths and weaknesses hidden by
global metrics, and supports more targeted model selection for use in Human
Resources (HR) systems and applications where fairness, explainability, and
contextual matching are essential.

TL;DR: The DeMeVa team explores in-context learning with LLMs and label distribution learning with RoBERTa for predicting perspectivist annotations in disagreement tasks, showing both approaches yield competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop effective methods for handling annotator disagreements in perspectivist annotation tasks, specifically for the LeWiDi 2025 shared task on Learning with Disagreements.

Method: Two approaches: (1) In-context learning with large language models using different example sampling strategies, and (2) Label distribution learning methods with RoBERTa using various fine-tuning techniques.

Result: ICL effectively predicts annotator-specific annotations, and aggregating these predictions into soft labels achieves competitive performance. LDL methods show promise for soft label predictions.

Conclusion: Both ICL and LDL methods are effective for perspectivist annotation tasks, with LDL methods being particularly promising for soft label predictions and deserving further exploration.

Abstract: This system paper presents the DeMeVa team's approaches to the third edition
of the Learning with Disagreements shared task (LeWiDi 2025; Leonardelli et
al., 2025). We explore two directions: in-context learning (ICL) with large
language models, where we compare example sampling strategies; and label
distribution learning (LDL) methods with RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019b), where we
evaluate several fine-tuning methods. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we
show that ICL can effectively predict annotator-specific annotations
(perspectivist annotations), and that aggregating these predictions into soft
labels yields competitive performance; and (2) we argue that LDL methods are
promising for soft label predictions and merit further exploration by the
perspectivist community.

Result: Revealed three key evolutionary phases: early LLM adoption and innovation, critical reflection on limitations, and integration of peripheral techniques into modular systems.

Conclusion: MetaGraph provides a structured, queryable view of financial NLP evolution and offers a reusable methodology for mapping scientific progress in other domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly reshaped financial NLP, enabling
new tasks and driving a proliferation of datasets and diversification of data
sources. Yet, this transformation has outpaced traditional surveys. In this
paper, we present MetaGraph, a generalizable methodology for extracting
knowledge graphs from scientific literature and analyzing them to obtain a
structured, queryable view of research trends. We define an ontology for
financial NLP research and apply an LLM-based extraction pipeline to 681 papers
(2022-2025), enabling large-scale, data-driven analysis. MetaGraph reveals
three key phases: early LLM adoption and task/dataset innovation; critical
reflection on LLM limitations; and growing integration of peripheral techniques
into modular systems. This structured view offers both practitioners and
researchers a clear understanding of how financial NLP has evolved -
highlighting emerging trends, shifting priorities, and methodological
shifts-while also demonstrating a reusable approach for mapping scientific
progress in other domains.

*Brittany Harbison,Samuel Taubman,Travis Taylor,Ashok. K. Goel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using GPT's zero-shot capability to detect Big-Five personality traits from forum posts to improve social matchmaking in online learning platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online learning environments lack organic social connections, and existing solutions like SAMI have limited effectiveness due to incomplete student modeling, particularly missing personality insights that could improve matchmaking relevance.

Method: Developed a personality detection model using GPT's zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from student introduction posts in online forums, then integrated this into SAMI's entity-based matchmaking system.

Result: The GPT-based model demonstrated efficacy in personality detection when benchmarked against established models. Initial integration showed personality traits can complement existing matching factors in social recommendations.

Conclusion: Personality-informed recommendations show promise for improving social connections in online learning, though further evaluation is needed to determine their full impact on student engagement and match quality.

Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments
present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one
solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is
constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an
effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to
intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations.
To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs
zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum
introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its
performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this
task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking
system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial
integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching
factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full
impact on student engagement and match quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with fine-grained emotion alignment despite good performance on broad emotion classification. The EXPRESS benchmark reveals limitations in capturing nuanced human emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on broad emotion classification but overlooks nuanced emotional expressions. There's a critical gap in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at fine-grained levels.

Method: Created EXPRESS benchmark dataset with 251 fine-grained emotion labels from Reddit communities. Used comprehensive evaluation framework that examines predicted emotion terms and decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories. Tested prevalent LLMs under various prompt settings.

Result: LLMs find it challenging to accurately predict emotions that align with human self-disclosed emotions. While some LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with established theories, they often fail to capture contextual cues as effectively as humans.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in fine-grained emotion alignment. The findings highlight the need for enhanced contextual understanding in future research to improve emotion recognition capabilities.

Abstract: The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in natural language
understanding has made them increasingly popular in mental health research.
While many studies explore LLMs' capabilities in emotion recognition, a
critical gap remains in evaluating whether LLMs align with human emotions at a
fine-grained level. Existing research typically focuses on classifying emotions
into predefined, limited categories, overlooking more nuanced expressions. To
address this gap, we introduce EXPRESS, a benchmark dataset curated from Reddit
communities featuring 251 fine-grained, self-disclosed emotion labels. Our
comprehensive evaluation framework examines predicted emotion terms and
decomposes them into eight basic emotions using established emotion theories,
enabling a fine-grained comparison. Systematic testing of prevalent LLMs under
various prompt settings reveals that accurately predicting emotions that align
with human self-disclosed emotions remains challenging. Qualitative analysis
further shows that while certain LLMs generate emotion terms consistent with
established emotion theories and definitions, they sometimes fail to capture
contextual cues as effectively as human self-disclosures. These findings
highlight the limitations of LLMs in fine-grained emotion alignment and offer
insights for future research aimed at enhancing their contextual understanding.

Abstract: Verbal autopsy (VA) is a critical tool for estimating causes of death in
resource-limited settings where medical certification is unavailable. This
study presents LA-VA, a proof-of-concept pipeline that combines Large Language
Models (LLMs) with traditional algorithmic approaches and embedding-based
classification for improved cause-of-death prediction. Using the Population
Health Metrics Research Consortium (PHMRC) dataset across three age categories
(Adult: 7,580; Child: 1,960; Neonate: 2,438), we evaluate multiple approaches:
GPT-5 predictions, LCVA baseline, text embeddings, and meta-learner ensembles.
Our results demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves the highest individual performance
with average test site accuracies of 48.6% (Adult), 50.5% (Child), and 53.5%

### [34] [Bridging the Capability Gap: Joint Alignment Tuning for Harmonizing LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09629)
*Minghang Zhu,Zhengliang Shi,Zhiwei Xu,Shiguang Wu,Lingjie Wang,Pengjie Ren,Zhaochun Ren,Zhumin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOAT is a joint alignment framework that improves collaboration between planning and grounding agents in multi-agent LLM systems through iterative alignment tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent LLM systems fine-tune agents independently, leading to capability gaps and poor coordination between planning and grounding agents.

Method: MOAT alternates between two stages: Planning Agent Alignment (optimizes subgoal generation to better guide grounding agent) and Grounding Agent Improving (fine-tunes using diverse subgoal-action pairs for better generalization).

Result: Achieves average improvements of 3.1% on held-in tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks across six benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: MOAT provides an effective joint alignment framework that ensures non-decreasing and convergent training, significantly improving multi-agent collaboration and task performance.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the construction
of multi-agent systems to solve complex tasks by dividing responsibilities
among specialized agents, such as a planning agent for subgoal generation and a
grounding agent for executing tool-use actions. Most existing methods typically
fine-tune these agents independently, leading to capability gaps among them
with poor coordination. To address this, we propose MOAT, a Multi-Agent Joint
Alignment Tuning framework that improves agents collaboration through iterative
alignment. MOAT alternates between two key stages: (1) Planning Agent
Alignment, which optimizes the planning agent to generate subgoal sequences
that better guide the grounding agent; and (2) Grounding Agent Improving, which
fine-tunes the grounding agent using diverse subgoal-action pairs generated by
the agent itself to enhance its generalization capablity. Theoretical analysis
proves that MOAT ensures a non-decreasing and progressively convergent training
process. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that MOAT outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 3.1% on held-in
tasks and 4.4% on held-out tasks.

*Siddarth Mamidanna,Daking Rai,Ziyu Yao,Yilun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper identifies an "All-for-One" subgraph in LLMs where mental math computation occurs only at the last token in late layers, receiving information from other tokens through specific middle layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs actually perform computations internally, specifically for mental math tasks, despite their theoretical capability to access all preceding tokens.

Method: Used Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and Attention-Based Peeking (ABP) to inhibit early token computations, restrict information transfer routes, and force computation at the last token.

Result: Identified a specific subgraph (AF1) that is sufficient and necessary for high performance on mental math tasks, transfers across models, and works with various input styles.

Conclusion: Meaningful computation in LLMs for mental math occurs very late and only at the last token, which receives information from other tokens through specific middle layers, revealing insights about internal computation mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate proficiency across numerous
computational tasks, yet their inner workings remain unclear. In theory, the
combination of causal self-attention and multilayer perceptron layers allows
every token to access and compute information based on all preceding tokens. In
practice, to what extent are such operations present? In this paper, on mental
math tasks (i.e., direct math calculation via next-token prediction without
explicit reasoning), we investigate this question in three steps: inhibiting
input-specific token computations in the initial layers, restricting the routes
of information transfer across token positions in the next few layers, and
forcing all computation to happen at the last token in the remaining layers.
With two proposed techniques, Context-Aware Mean Ablation (CAMA) and
Attention-Based Peeking (ABP), we identify an All-for-One subgraph (AF1) with
high accuracy on a wide variety of mental math tasks, where meaningful
computation occurs very late (in terms of layer depth) and only at the last
token, which receives information of other tokens in few specific middle
layers. Experiments on a variety of models and arithmetic expressions show that
this subgraph is sufficient and necessary for high model performance, transfers
across different models, and works on a variety of input styles. Ablations on
different CAMA and ABP alternatives reveal their unique advantages over other
methods, which may be of independent interest.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SteerMoE framework detects and controls behavior-linked experts in MoE LLMs to steer model behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining, achieving significant improvements and also demonstrating vulnerability to adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for controlling specific behaviors in Mixture-of-Experts LLMs by identifying and manipulating specialized experts that exhibit distinct activation patterns for contrasting behaviors, enabling behavior steering without model modification.

Method: Detects experts with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs showing contrasting behaviors, then selectively activates or deactivates these experts during inference to control behaviors like faithfulness and safety.

Result: Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, steering improved safety by up to +20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial mode, it reduced safety by -41% alone and -100% when combined with jailbreak methods, bypassing all safety guardrails.

Conclusion: SteerMoE provides effective behavior control for MoE models without retraining, but also reveals a new dimension of alignment faking hidden within experts, exposing potential vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in Large Language Models (LLMs) routes each token
through a subset of specialized Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), known as experts.
We present SteerMoE, a framework for steering MoE models by detecting and
controlling behavior-linked experts. Our detection method identifies experts
with distinct activation patterns across paired inputs exhibiting contrasting
behaviors. By selectively (de)activating such experts during inference, we
control behaviors like faithfulness and safety without retraining or modifying
weights. Across 11 benchmarks and 6 LLMs, our steering raises safety by up to
+20% and faithfulness by +27%. In adversarial attack mode, it drops safety by
-41% alone, and -100% when combined with existing jailbreak methods, bypassing
all safety guardrails and exposing a new dimension of alignment faking hidden
within experts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CDE framework uses intrinsic curiosity signals from actor (perplexity) and critic (value variance) to improve exploration in RLVR, achieving +3 point improvement on AIME benchmarks and revealing calibration collapse issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods suffer from poor exploration, premature convergence, and entropy collapse, limiting LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: Curiosity-Driven Exploration (CDE) uses actor perplexity over generated responses and critic value estimate variance from multi-head architecture as exploration bonuses within RLVR framework.

Result: Achieves approximately +3 point improvement over standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks, and identifies calibration collapse mechanism in LLMs.

Conclusion: CDE effectively addresses exploration challenges in RLVR through intrinsic curiosity signals, improving performance while providing insights into LLM failure modes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet
current RLVR methods often explore poorly, leading to premature convergence and
entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we introduce Curiosity-Driven
Exploration (CDE), a framework that leverages the model's own intrinsic sense
of curiosity to guide exploration. We formalize curiosity with signals from
both the actor and the critic: for the actor, we use perplexity over its
generated response, and for the critic, we use the variance of value estimates
from a multi-head architecture. Both signals serve as an exploration bonus
within the RLVR framework to guide the model. Our theoretical analysis shows
that the actor-wise bonus inherently penalizes overconfident errors and
promotes diversity among correct responses; moreover, we connect the
critic-wise bonus to the well-established count-based exploration bonus in RL.
Empirically, our method achieves an approximate +3 point improvement over
standard RLVR using GRPO/PPO on AIME benchmarks. Further analysis identifies a
calibration collapse mechanism within RLVR, shedding light on common LLM
failure modes.

TL;DR: ReT-2 is a unified multimodal retrieval model that handles both image and text queries to search across multimodal document collections, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing retrieval methods are limited to single-modality queries or documents and require task-specific fine-tuning, creating a need for a unified model that can handle complex multimodal retrieval tasks.

Method: ReT-2 uses multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details.

Result: ReT-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different retrieval configurations, with faster inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. It also improves downstream performance when integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines.

Conclusion: ReT-2 provides an effective unified solution for multimodal retrieval that supports both image and text queries, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency while being publicly available for research use.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using Vision Diffusion Model features with transformer aggregation achieves human-like action recognition across species, viewpoints, and contexts, setting new SOTA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans can recognize actions despite large variations in context and viewpoint, but current deep learning models struggle with such generalization.

Method: Features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM) are aggregated via a transformer, using a model conditioned on earlier timesteps to highlight semantic information over pixel-level details.

Result: The model sets new state-of-the-art across three generalization benchmarks: classifying actions across animal species, different viewing angles, and different recording contexts.

Conclusion: This approach brings machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness by leveraging diffusion model features for enhanced generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

Motivation: Existing safety approaches fail to proactively prevent harmful outputs from LLMs that could affect vulnerable populations like LGBTQ+ individuals and marginalized communities.

Method: Uses VulnGuard Prompt with hybrid techniques including real-world data-driven contrastive learning, few-shot examples from GitHub, ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting across six core modules.

Result: Demonstrates 25-30% analytical harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality with formal mathematical proofs and theoretical validation.

Conclusion: PromptGuard establishes mathematical foundations for systematic harm prevention in LLMs through its modular framework and theoretical validation.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single

post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful

VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,

TL;DR: Beta-SOD: A novel statistical outlier detection framework using Beta mixture models to handle label noise in object re-identification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various noise levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object re-identification methods are highly sensitive to label noise, which causes significant performance degradation. Existing approaches need robust mechanisms to handle noisy labels effectively.

Method: Reframes Re-ID as supervised image similarity using Siamese networks with Beta-SOD framework - models cosine similarity distribution with two-component Beta mixture model. Combines binary cross-entropy, contrastive, and cosine embedding losses for joint optimization.

Result: Superior performance on CUHK03, Market-1501 (person Re-ID) and VeRi-776 (vehicle Re-ID) datasets across 10-30% noise levels. Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in de-noising and Re-ID tasks.

Conclusion: Beta-SOD provides an effective statistical framework for handling label noise in Re-ID, demonstrating robustness and broad applicability in noisy scenarios with proven identifiability guarantees.

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net improves coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images using multi-scale structural priors, state-space modeling, and frequency-domain enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coronary Artery Disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and existing ICA image analysis methods struggle with low contrast, high noise, and complex vascular structures, limiting clinical adoption.

Method: End-to-end framework with Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement module for highlighting vascular structures and Progressive High-Frequency Perception module using wavelet decomposition to refine details while integrating global structures.

Result: Outperformed state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics and achieved highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Conclusion: SFD-Mamba2Net effectively addresses challenges in ICA image analysis through integrated structural and frequency-domain approaches, demonstrating superior performance for clinical CAD diagnosis.

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated MRI-based framework for predicting surgical outcomes in colorectal liver metastasis using segmentation and radiomics pipelines, achieving 10%+ improvement over existing biomarkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current prognostic models for colorectal liver metastasis lack predictive power, especially for multifocal cases, necessitating better automated prediction methods from medical imaging.

Method: Combines segmentation pipeline using SAMONAI (zero-shot 3D prompt propagation) for liver/tumor/spleen segmentation with radiomics pipeline using SurvAMINN (autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network) for survival prediction from pre/post-contrast MRI.

Result: Framework outperforms existing clinical and genomic biomarkers with C-index improvement exceeding 10% on 227-patient institutional dataset.

Conclusion: Integration of automated segmentation and radiomics-based survival analysis provides accurate, efficient, and interpretable outcome prediction for colorectal liver metastasis.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Motivation: To understand when and how visual representations learned by different generative models diverge, and to systematically discover visual attributes that appear in one model's outputs but not another's.

Method: Introduced CompCon, an evolutionary search algorithm that identifies visual attributes more prevalent in one model's output and uncovers associated prompt concepts. Created ID2 dataset with 60 input-dependent differences for evaluation and compared against LLM/VLM baselines.

Result: Successfully discovered divergent representations between popular models, such as PixArt depicting loneliness prompts with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicting African American people in media professions.

Conclusion: CompCon provides an effective automated approach for comparing and understanding visual representation differences between text-to-image models, revealing systematic biases and stylistic variations across different generative architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

### [45] [An U-Net-Based Deep Neural Network for Cloud Shadow and Sun-Glint Correction of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08949)
*Yibin Wang,Wondimagegn Beshah,Padmanava Dash,Haifeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel machine learning approach using U-Net deep learning to identify and correct cloud shadows and sun glint in UAS imagery for water quality monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UAS imagery is often affected by cloud shadows and sun glint, which pose serious issues for estimating water quality parameters from aerial images, especially over water bodies.

Method: Used U-Net based deep learning model trained on pixel-level data extracted from images to identify and extract regions with cloud shadows and sun glint, separating them from clear sky and unaffected regions.

Result: Developed a high-quality image correction model that can recover cloud shadow and sun glint areas in UAS images through optimal model training settings identified from various evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed machine learning approach successfully addresses the limitations of UAS imagery by effectively identifying and correcting cloud shadows and sun glint, enabling more accurate water quality parameter estimation from aerial imagery.

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin is a novel Vision Transformer architecture that combines hierarchical shifted window attention with convolutional feature learning to enhance local feature extraction while maintaining global context modeling, achieving significant performance improvements on multiple small-scale image classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers excel at global context modeling but lack inductive biases like locality and translation equivariance, which limits their performance on small datasets where local feature extraction is crucial.

Method: CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement module into each attention block, enabling simultaneous capture of fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure through local-global feature fusion.

Result: CoSwin achieves consistent performance gains: 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over baseline Swin Transformer.

Conclusion: The local-global feature fusion approach effectively enhances transformer generalization and robustness for small-scale vision tasks, demonstrating the importance of combining convolutional inductive biases with self-attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher is a differentiable framework for point cloud feature matching that uses learned features to predict geometrically consistent confidence matrices, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve point cloud registration by developing a fully differentiable framework that incorporates both local and global geometric consistency for more accurate feature matching.

Method: Uses local graph embedding for initial score matrix, followed by bilateral repositioning via nearest neighbor search, and global geometric consistency learning to refine matching probabilities.

Result: Achieves 95%-97% inlier ratio on KITTI, 94%-97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch, demonstrating superior performance across diverse indoor/outdoor datasets.

Conclusion: iMatcher significantly improves rigid registration performance and shows robustness across various settings, establishing new state-of-the-art results in point cloud feature matching.

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

*Magdalena Wysocki,Felix Duelmer,Ananya Bal,Nassir Navab,Mohammad Farid Azampour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltrON is a novel occupancy-based representation method that leverages acoustic features from B-mode ultrasound images for 3D shape reconstruction, addressing occlusion and annotation dependency issues without additional annotation costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound 3D reconstruction methods rely on precise annotations and struggle with view-dependent artifacts and acoustic shadowing. There's a need to utilize the rich acoustic information in B-mode images and overcome occlusion limitations for more accurate reconstruction.

Method: Proposes UltrON - an occupancy-based representation that uses acoustic features from B-mode images. Introduces a novel loss function to compensate for view-dependency and enables occupancy optimization from multiview ultrasound without additional annotations.

Result: UltrON demonstrates improved geometric consistency in weakly-supervised optimization, mitigates occlusion and sparse labeling limitations, and generalizes to shapes of the same anatomy by incorporating acoustic properties.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides more accurate 3D reconstruction from ultrasound by effectively utilizing acoustic information and addressing view-dependent artifacts, paving the way for better clinical shape reconstruction from free-hand ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging MRI is important but challenging, requiring accurate and efficient methods for large-scale analysis.

Method: Uses implicit neural representations (INRs) conditioned on learned latent codes to predict continuous left ventricular displacement without requiring inference-time optimization.

Result: Achieved best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and lowest combined error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain on 452 UK Biobank test cases, while being ~380x faster than the most accurate baseline.

Conclusion: INR-based models are suitable for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in large cardiac MRI datasets.

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring

achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MLNet improves Universal Domain Adaptation by adding dynamic weighting to OEM, focusing adaptation on relevant class boundaries to better distinguish known vs unknown classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like MLNet treat all classifiers equally, diluting learning signals. There's a need for more focused adaptation that prioritizes relevant class boundaries for each target sample.

Method: Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet) integrates dynamic weighting strategy to Open-set Entropy Minimization (OEM), using closed-set classifier predictions to focus adaptation on most relevant class boundaries.

Result: Achieves highest average H-scores on VisDA and ImageCLEF benchmarks, outperforms MLNet in 22/31 Open-Partial DA tasks and 19/31 Open-Set DA tasks, demonstrating superior robustness.

Conclusion: Dynamic weighting strategy effectively sharpens distinction between known and unknown classes, confirming benefits of focused adaptation approach in Universal Domain Adaptation.

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

TL;DR: COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu image-caption dataset with 59,000 images and 319,000 captions, created to address the under-representation of Urdu in multimodal research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urdu is critically under-served in multimodal research despite being spoken by over 250 million people, with no large-scale high-quality datasets available, which limits Urdu-capable systems and reinforces biases in multilingual models.

Method: Derived from MS COCO using stratified sampling, captions were translated with SeamlessM4T v2 and validated through a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework combining COMET-Kiwi, CLIP-based similarity, and BERTScore with back-translation. Low-quality captions were refined using open-source LLMs.

Result: The dataset contains 319,000 high-quality Urdu captions benchmarked with strong BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF scores. COCO-Urdu is the largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset.

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu reduces language bias in multimodal research and establishes a foundation for inclusive vision-language systems, with both dataset and quality pipeline publicly released.

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCGM is a novel diffusion-based framework that integrates anatomical constraints to generate high-quality counterfactual 3D brain MRIs, preserving subtle morphometric variations for medical studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D brain MRI studies need to detect subtle morphometric differences between cohorts, but counterfactual models struggle to produce anatomically plausible MRIs due to lack of explicit inductive biases for preserving fine-grained anatomical details.

Method: Proposes Probabilistic Causal Graph Model (PCGM) that integrates anatomical constraints via probabilistic graph module, generates spatial binary masks for subtle variation regions, and uses a 3D ControlNet-encoded mask with a novel counterfactual denoising UNet and 3D diffusion decoder.

Result: PCGM generates structural brain MRIs of higher quality than baseline approaches. Brain measurements from PCGM counterfactuals replicate subtle disease effects on cortical regions previously reported in neuroscience literature.

Conclusion: This represents an important milestone for using synthetic MRIs in studies investigating subtle morphological differences, demonstrating the first successful replication of known disease effects through counterfactual generation.

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCNs for human action recognition fail to effectively detect human-object interactions due to lack of scene information representation and appropriate learning architectures for handling object context.

Method: Proposed methodology uses fixed object information in the environment with a multi-task learning approach, collecting real-world data including hands-on fixed object interactions and non-interaction classes.

Result: Achieved 99.25% accuracy in recognizing interaction and non-interaction actions, outperforming the base skeleton-only model by 2.75%.

Conclusion: Incorporating fixed object information through multi-task learning significantly improves human-object interaction recognition performance compared to using only human skeleton poses.

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

TL;DR: A novel feature fusion framework called IRDFusion that uses cross-modal contrastive learning and iterative feedback to enhance object features while suppressing background noise in multispectral object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multispectral object detection methods retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance. There's a need for better cross-modal feature integration that focuses on salient object structures while suppressing interference.

Method: Proposes IRDFusion framework with two modules: Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) for intra- and inter-modal feature enhancement, and Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM) that computes inter-modal differential features as guidance signals. These work together in an iterative feedback mechanism to amplify salient signals and suppress noise.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on FLIR, LLVIP and M³FD datasets, consistently outperforming existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion through iterative feedback, significantly improving multispectral object detection by effectively enhancing object features while suppressing background noise and common-mode interference.

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

TL;DR: SQAP-VLA is a training-free framework that simultaneously applies quantization and token pruning to Vision-Language-Action models, achieving 1.93× speedup while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models have high computational and memory costs that hinder practical deployment, and existing approaches fail to combine quantization and token pruning effectively due to incompatibility issues.

Method: Co-designs quantization and token pruning pipeline with new quantization-aware token pruning criteria and improved quantizer design to work on aggressively quantized models.

Result: Achieves ×1.93 speedup and up to 4.5% average success rate enhancement compared to original VLA models while preserving core performance.

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA successfully enables simultaneous state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning, overcoming previous incompatibility issues and significantly improving VLA model efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance

*Chenghao Zhang,Lun Luo,Si-Yuan Cao,Xiaokai Bai,Yuncheng Jin,Zhu Yu,Beinan Yu,Yisen Wang,Hui-Liang Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S-BEVLoc is a self-supervised LiDAR global localization framework that eliminates the need for ground-truth poses by using BEV images and geographic distances between keypoint patches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NCLT datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR localization approaches require expensive ground-truth poses from GPS or SLAM odometry for supervision. This work aims to eliminate this dependency to reduce costs and improve scalability.

Method: Uses BEV images to construct training triplets based on geographic distances between keypoint-centered patches. Employs CNN for local feature extraction, NetVLAD for global descriptor aggregation, and introduces SoftCos loss for triplet learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and NCLT datasets for place recognition, loop closure, and global localization tasks while offering superior scalability compared to supervised approaches.

Conclusion: S-BEVLoc demonstrates that self-supervised learning can effectively replace supervised methods for LiDAR global localization, providing comparable performance without requiring costly ground-truth pose data.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

TL;DR: FPI-Det dataset for detecting phone usage through face-phone interactions with 22,879 annotated images across diverse scenarios, featuring extreme scale variations and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile device usage detection requires understanding behavioral context and relationships between faces, hands, and devices, which existing benchmarks don't adequately capture for safety monitoring and productivity assessment.

Method: Created FPI-Det dataset with synchronized face and phone annotations across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios, then evaluated YOLO and DETR detectors as baselines.

Result: Provided baseline performance results and analysis across object sizes, occlusion levels, and different environments using the new dataset.

Conclusion: FPI-Det addresses the gap in fine-grained human-device interaction benchmarks and enables better evaluation of phone usage detection systems in real-world conditions.

Abstract: The widespread use of mobile devices has created new challenges for vision
systems in safety monitoring, workplace productivity assessment, and attention
management. Detecting whether a person is using a phone requires not only
object recognition but also an understanding of behavioral context, which
involves reasoning about the relationship between faces, hands, and devices
under diverse conditions. Existing generic benchmarks do not fully capture such
fine-grained human--device interactions. To address this gap, we introduce the
FPI-Det, containing 22{,}879 images with synchronized annotations for faces and
phones across workplace, education, transportation, and public scenarios. The
dataset features extreme scale variation, frequent occlusions, and varied
capture conditions. We evaluate representative YOLO and DETR detectors,
providing baseline results and an analysis of performance across object sizes,
occlusion levels, and environments. Source code and dataset is available at

TL;DR: ZeroPlantSeg is a zero-shot method for segmenting entire rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images by combining foundation segmentation models and vision-language models without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting entire plant individuals with multiple overlapping leaves is challenging and typically requires annotated training datasets that are species-specific and labor-intensive to create.

Method: Integrates a foundation segmentation model to extract leaf instances and a vision-language model to reason about plant structures for extracting complete plant individuals without additional training.

Result: Outperforms existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than supervised methods across multiple plant species, growth stages, and shooting environments.

Conclusion: The proposed ZeroPlantSeg approach successfully addresses hierarchical plant segmentation without training, demonstrating strong zero-shot and cross-domain capabilities for plant analysis.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper improves CLIP for person representation learning by creating WebPerson dataset (5M high-quality person-centric image-text pairs) and proposing GA-DMS framework with adaptive noise masking and masked token prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP faces challenges in person representation learning due to scarcity of person-centric vision-language data and limitations of global contrastive learning that struggles with fine-grained matching and noisy text tokens.

Method: Developed noise-resistant data pipeline using MLLMs to filter and caption web images, and introduced GA-DMS framework with gradient-attention guided dual-masking and masked token prediction objectives.

Result: GA-DMS achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating improved cross-modal alignment and fine-grained semantic representation.

Conclusion: The synergistic approach of improved data curation (WebPerson dataset) and model architecture (GA-DMS framework) effectively advances CLIP for person representation learning.

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET is a low-resource PET foundation model that uses latent diffusion with innovative mask augmentation and attention mechanisms to achieve high-quality sinogram generation with only 500 samples, enabling multiple PET imaging tasks with minimal computational requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building large-scale foundation models for PET imaging is challenging due to limited labeled data access and insufficient computational resources. The paper aims to overcome data scarcity and efficiency limitations in PET imaging.

Method: Proposes ALL-PET with three key innovations: 1) Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) generating 200,000+ diverse training samples, 2) Dynamic multi-mask mechanism for enhanced diversity, 3) Positive/negative mask constraints for geometric consistency, and 4) Transparent medical attention (TMA) - a parameter-free geometry-driven mechanism for lesion enhancement in projection data.

Result: ALL-PET achieves high-quality sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to models trained on larger datasets. It generalizes across multiple tasks including low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and tracer separation, while operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

Conclusion: ALL-PET demonstrates that effective PET foundation models can be built with minimal data and computational resources through innovative mask augmentation strategies and geometry-aware attention mechanisms, enabling broad clinical applicability without heavy resource demands.

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compare noise robustness between Persistent Homology (traditional topological analysis) and Artificial Neural Networks for predicting topological structure (Betti numbers) from data.

Method: Trained supervised neural network to predict Betti numbers and compared against PH pipeline using cubical complexes and Signed Euclidean Distance Transform (SEDT) on one synthetic and two real-world datasets.

Result: ANNs outperformed the PH approach under noise conditions, demonstrating better noise robustness.

Conclusion: ANNs offer a compelling alternative to PH for topology estimation under structural noise, leveraging their capacity to learn from training data.

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

TL;DR: OSIM is a new evaluation metric for 3D scenes that focuses on object-level perception rather than overall image quality, better aligning with human visual perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics assess overall image quality but create discrepancies with human perception, which fundamentally involves attention to individual objects as basic units of visual recognition.

Method: Leverages object detection models and their feature representations to quantify the 'objectness' of each object in 3D scenes, enabling object-centric evaluations.

Result: User study shows OSIM aligns more closely with human perception compared to existing metrics. The authors also re-evaluated recent 3D reconstruction and generation models using standardized experimental setup.

Conclusion: OSIM provides a more human-aligned evaluation approach for 3D scenes by focusing on object-level perception, and helps clarify advancements in 3D reconstruction and generation field.

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Result: The survey reinterprets major architectural milestones (two-stream CNNs, 3D CNNs, transformers, etc.) as concrete responses to dataset-driven pressures and provides practical guidance for model design.

Conclusion: By unifying datasets, inductive biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey offers both a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing general-purpose video understanding.

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex

responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The OCELOT 2023 challenge demonstrated that incorporating multi-scale cell-tissue interactions significantly improves cell detection performance in pathology images, with top models achieving up to 7.99 F1-score improvement over cell-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists examine Whole-Slide Images at multiple magnifications to evaluate both broad tissue morphology and cellular details, but existing deep learning models struggle to replicate this multi-scale analysis behavior and learn interdependent semantics between different structural levels.

Method: The challenge created a dataset with multi-scale overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from 673 image pairs across 6 organs from TCGA Whole-Slide Images. Participants developed models that incorporated cell-tissue relationships rather than using cell-only detection approaches.

Result: Top-performing models achieved substantial improvements, with up to 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to baseline cell-only models that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships.

Conclusion: Understanding cell-tissue interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance in pathology image analysis, and incorporating multi-scale semantics into deep learning models provides significant performance improvements over traditional cell-only detection methods.

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

Result: Achieves superior performance in detecting small and densely packed objects while maintaining real-time speed without increased computational complexity.

Conclusion: Provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time detection systems for UAV imagery.

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This

TL;DR: A training-free framework for KB-VQA that reduces knowledge redundancy by enhancing retrieval relevance, extracting beneficial knowledge segments, and selectively integrating knowledge only when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KB-VQA approaches directly augment models with retrieved knowledge but ignore substantial knowledge redundancy, which introduces noise and reduces answer accuracy.

Method: 1) Create low-noise queries from image-question pairs for better knowledge retrieval 2) Use large models to identify and extract answer-beneficial knowledge segments 3) Implement selective knowledge integration only when the model lacks confidence

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that the framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by acquiring more accurate and critical knowledge.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free framework effectively mitigates knowledge redundancy and noise in KB-VQA, leading to improved performance through better knowledge relevance and selective integration.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CWSSNet framework combines 3D spectral-spatial features with wavelet convolution for hyperspectral image classification, achieving high accuracy with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral images have rich spectral information but suffer from feature redundancy due to high dimensionality and spectral mixing, requiring advanced classification methods.

Method: Proposed CWSSNet framework integrating 3D spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution using multiscale convolutional attention module and multi-band decomposition in wavelet domain.

Result: Achieved 74.50% mIoU, 82.73% mAcc, and 84.94% mF1 on ZY1F satellite data; highest IoU for water bodies, vegetation, and bare land classification with good robustness and limited training time increase.

Conclusion: CWSSNet effectively addresses hyperspectral classification challenges, maintains reliable performance under small-sample training conditions, and demonstrates superior classification accuracy compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Motivation: Address the research gap in evaluating AI-generated image detection methods under complex real-world conditions, as current datasets lack coverage of diverse scenarios and real-world distortions.

Method: Created RRDataset with three evaluation dimensions: scenario generalization across 7 major content categories, internet transmission robustness through social media sharing, and re-digitization robustness via 4 alteration methods. Benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 VLMs, plus human study with 192 participants.

Result: Benchmarking revealed significant limitations of current AI detection methods in real-world conditions. Human participants demonstrated superior few-shot learning capabilities compared to automated detectors.

Conclusion: Current AI detection methods are insufficient for real-world applications, and future robust detection algorithms should incorporate human adaptability and learning capabilities to improve performance across diverse scenarios and distortions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image

Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World

high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light object detection is challenging due to degraded image quality. Existing approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex frameworks, creating a need for a more efficient solution.

Method: Deconstructs conventional ISP pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules as differentiable components. Uses content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors with a Self-Boost mechanism for sub-module cooperation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches on three RAW image datasets, achieving superior results in challenging low-light environments with minimal parameters.

Conclusion: Dark-ISP enables seamless end-to-end training for object detection by directly processing Bayer RAW images, providing an effective lightweight solution for low-light object detection with automatic RAW-to-RGB conversion aligned with detection objectives.

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

### [73] [MGTraj: Multi-Granularity Goal-Guided Human Trajectory Prediction with Recursive Refinement Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09200)
*Ge Sun,Jun Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGTraj is a multi-granularity goal-guided model for human trajectory prediction that recursively refines trajectory proposals from coarse to fine levels using transformer-based networks and achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most goal-guided approaches operate at extreme granularities (coarse goal prediction and fine trajectory completion), leaving intermediate temporal granularity unexplored despite its potential utility in capturing diverse human dynamics and motion patterns.

Method: MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals from coarse to fine granularity levels using transformer-based recursive refinement networks (RRN). Features across granularities are integrated with weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is used as an auxiliary task.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset show MGTraj outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-granularity approach effectively integrates intermediate temporal granularity into goal-guided frameworks, demonstrating superior performance in human trajectory prediction tasks.

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

### [74] [Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232)
*Jiesi Hu,Jianfeng Cao,Yanwu Yang,Chenfei Ye,Yixuan Zhang,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Medverse is a universal in-context learning model for 3D medical imaging that achieves high-fidelity predictions with global anatomical understanding across diverse tasks and anatomical regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ICL models for medical imaging cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and lack unified training across diverse medical imaging tasks and anatomical regions, limiting the potential of ICL in medical imaging.

Method: Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, and uses a blockwise cross-attention module for long-range interactions between context and target inputs while maintaining computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. It's trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks across multiple organs, modalities, and clinical centers.

Result: Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines on held-out datasets covering unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs with multi-scale anatomical awareness.

Conclusion: Medverse establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning in medical imaging, demonstrating superior performance and generalization capabilities across diverse medical imaging tasks and anatomical regions.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAtNeXt, a novel hybrid model combining CoAtNet architecture with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks and CBAM attention, achieves state-of-the-art performance in gastric tissue image classification, outperforming both CNN and ViT models on binary and multiclass tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual histopathologic examination of gastric tissue is labor-intensive, prone to variability among pathologists, and may miss critical findings. There's a need for automated, reliable methods to improve diagnostic consistency and efficiency.

Method: Proposed CoAtNeXt model built on CoAtNet architecture by replacing MBConv layers with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks and integrating CBAM for improved local feature extraction through channel and spatial attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for histopathological gastric tissue classification that shows potential to assist pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload through automated analysis.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

*Jing Hao,Yuxuan Fan,Yanpeng Sun,Kaixin Guo,Lizhuo Lin,Jinrong Yang,Qi Yong H. Ai,Lun M. Wong,Hao Tang,Kuo Feng Hung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMOral is the first large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark for panoramic X-ray interpretation in dentistry, consisting of 20,563 annotated images with 1.3 million instruction instances. Current LVLMs perform poorly (41.45% accuracy), but OralGPT (fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B) shows 24.73% improvement after SFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models have shown strong performance on general medical tasks but remain underexplored in specialized domains like dentistry. Panoramic X-rays present unique challenges due to dense anatomical structures and subtle pathological cues not captured by existing benchmarks.

Method: Created MMOral dataset with 20,563 annotated panoramic X-rays and 1.3M instruction instances across attribute extraction, report generation, VQA, and dialogue. Developed MMOral-Bench evaluation suite covering 5 diagnostic dimensions. Proposed OralGPT by conducting supervised fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the MMOral dataset.

Result: Evaluation of 64 LVLMs showed poor performance (best model GPT-4o achieved only 41.45% accuracy). OralGPT demonstrated substantial improvement with 24.73% performance enhancement after just one epoch of supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: MMOral and OralGPT provide a critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically impactful multimodal AI systems in dental applications. The significant performance gap reveals current limitations of LVLMs in specialized medical domains, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

### [77] [DATE: Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09263)
*Chao Yuan,Yang Yang,Yehui Yang,Zach Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DATE enhances temporal awareness in MLLMs through timestamp injection and semantic-guided sampling for better long video understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs struggle with long-range temporal dependencies and precise event localization in long videos due to uniform frame sampling and implicit position encodings.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) with Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy that treats video sampling as vision-language retrieval with two-stage algorithm for semantic relevance and temporal coverage.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on hour-long video benchmarks, with 7B model outperforming many 72B models on some tasks, showing remarkable improvements in absolute time understanding and key event localization.

Conclusion: DATE effectively addresses long video understanding challenges by enhancing temporal awareness through explicit timestamp integration and semantic-guided sampling strategies.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

*Linhao Li,Yiwen Ye,Ziyang Chen,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSP-Seg is a progressive pruning framework for efficient 3D medical image segmentation that reduces GPU memory by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameters by 83-87% while maintaining performance comparable to nnU-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D medical image segmentation faces heavy resource and time consumption, limiting clinical scalability. Existing efficient models are static and manually designed, lacking adaptability and difficulty balancing performance with efficiency.

Method: Progressive pruning framework starting with redundant model, iteratively pruning redundant modules using block-wise pruning and functional decoupling loss.

Result: PSP-Seg-S variant achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU memory by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameters by 83-87% across five datasets.

Conclusion: PSP-Seg offers a cost-effective, high-performing alternative for widespread clinical application of 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

### [79] [Visual Programmability: A Guide for Code-as-Thought in Chart Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09286)
*Bohao Tang,Yan Ma,Fei Zhang,Jiadi Su,Ethan Chern,Zhulin Hu,Zhixin Wang,Pengfei Liu,Ya Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach uses adaptive visual programmability to dynamically choose between code-based symbolic reasoning and direct visual analysis for chart understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chart understanding methods have limitations - some rely on brittle external tools, while others use single reasoning strategies like text-based chain-of-thought that are difficult to verify for reinforcement learning.

Method: Proposes an adaptive framework where VLMs learn to choose between CaT pathway (code-based symbolic representation) and direct visual reasoning pathway. Uses reinforcement learning with dual-reward system combining data-accuracy and decision rewards.

Result: Demonstrates strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks, showing VLMs can dynamically select optimal reasoning pathways.

Conclusion: VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, adapting their approach based on visual programmability of each chart-question pair.

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

*Anthony P. Addison,Felix Wagner,Wentian Xu,Natalie Voets,Konstantinos Kamnitsas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A U-net modification with modality-agnostic input channels enables brain MRI segmentation on both seen and unseen modalities using synthetic MRI augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are limited to fixed modalities and cannot effectively handle new modalities at inference, losing modality-specific information.

Method: Modified U-net architecture with modality-agnostic input channel alongside modality-specific channels, trained using image augmentation that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities while maintaining anatomical integrity.

Result: Evaluated on 8 MRI databases with 5 pathologies and 8 modalities, the approach effectively processes both training-seen and unseen modalities while improving segmentation performance.

Conclusion: The simple architectural modification enables practical deployment of segmentation models that can utilize any available imaging modalities, including previously unseen ones.

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Conclusion: The proposed solution is particularly well-suited for reliable UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments, demonstrating consistent improvements over baseline methods through comprehensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Open-set detection is crucial for robust UAV autonomy in air-to-air object

method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

Result: Significant performance gap between MLLMs and human experts. Models exhibit degradation on questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated visual perception. Simple prompting strategies fail to alleviate limitations.

Conclusion: Existing MLLMs have limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization scenarios. MatCha benchmark will facilitate future research in new material discovery and autonomous scientific agents.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR is a novel object-centric learning framework that disentangles target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR images contain complex background clutter that resembles targets, causing models to extract entangled or spurious features that undermine clear target representation regardless of classifier used.

Method: Extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X and low-level scattering features from wavelet scattering network, then uses multi-level slot attention module to integrate these complementary features for enhanced slot-wise representation distinctiveness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Conclusion: SlotSAR effectively addresses the challenge of disentangling target representations from background clutter in SAR images without requiring mask annotations, demonstrating superior performance through its multi-level feature integration approach.

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

*Hao Si,Ehsan Javanmardi,Manabu Tsukada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHCP is a novel framework for heterogeneous collaborative perception that enables dynamic feature alignment during inference without joint training, using few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation to handle model heterogeneity between vehicles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require joint training or pre-stored models for each collaborator, which is impractical in real-world scenarios where vehicles have heterogeneous models from different manufacturers.

Method: PHCP formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation and dynamically aligns features by self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled data and joint training.

Result: Extensive experiments on OPV2V dataset show PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios, with performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on entire dataset using only small amount of unlabeled data.

Conclusion: PHCP successfully addresses heterogeneous collaborative perception directly during inference without joint training, making it practical for real-world applications where vehicles have different models.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

*Illia Volkov,Nikita Kisel,Klara Janouskova,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comprehensive evaluation of dual-encoder VLMs shows language and vision offer complementary strengths for zero-shot classification, with a simple fusion method improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models have strong zero-shot classification through image-text alignment, but their purely visual inference capabilities remain under-explored.

Method: Evaluated both language-guided and vision-only image classification with diverse dual-encoder VLMs on ImageNet-1k, analyzed key factors affecting accuracy, and introduced a learning-free fusion method based on per-class precision.

Result: Language and vision offer complementary strengths - some classes favor textual prompts while others are better handled by visual similarity. The fusion method improves classification performance.

Conclusion: The complementarity between language and vision in VLMs can be effectively exploited through simple fusion methods to enhance zero-shot classification performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates self-supervised pre-training strategies for few-shot surgical skill assessment, showing that domain-relevant datasets outperform large but less aligned ones, with procedure-specific data boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surgical skill assessment requires expert annotations that are scarce and time-consuming. Few-shot learning offers a scalable alternative but depends on effective pre-training, which remains unexplored in surgical skill assessment.

Method: The authors formulate surgical skill assessment as a few-shot task, evaluate various self-supervised pre-training sources across three few-shot settings (1-, 2-, and 5-shot), and analyze domain similarity and procedure-specific data inclusion.

Result: Domain-relevant datasets achieved accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in 1-, 2-, and 5-shot settings respectively. Including procedure-specific data with domain-relevant external datasets boosted performance by +1.22% accuracy and +2.28% F1-score.

Conclusion: Small domain-relevant datasets outperform large but less aligned ones for surgical skill assessment. Procedure-specific data integration with relevant external datasets significantly improves performance, while the same strategy with less similar large-scale sources can degrade performance.

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human error from distracted and impaired driving is a major cause of road accidents, and existing systems often rely on inter-vehicular communication which limits analysis to connected vehicles only.

Method: Uses computer vision techniques including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring with YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms.

Result: Experimental evaluations show the framework is reliable and adaptable across diverse road and environmental conditions, successfully detecting unsafe behaviors like excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectories.

Conclusion: The vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles and provides an effective solution for detecting distracted and impaired driving through external observation techniques.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.

Conclusion: The released dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code aim to catalyze advancements in reasoning-oriented text-to-image generation by providing previously unavailable resources to the research community.

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench

*Xiaodong Wang,Zijun He,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for intrinsic image decomposition that handles complex scenes with severe lighting and rich textures using texture-guided regularization to separate reflectance and shading layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous learning-based methods produce texture-less and over-smoothing intrinsic images, failing to handle complex scenes with spatially-varying lighting and rich textures effectively.

Method: Design a texture-guided regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an optimization framework to separate material textures from lighting effects.

Result: The proposed method produces high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images, superior to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Combining texture-aware prior enables effective intrinsic image decomposition in complex scenes with severe lighting and rich textures.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper establishes a unified framework connecting Plug-and-Play methods and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models for solving inverse problems, particularly in single-pixel imaging, by proposing a hybrid data-consistency approach that improves reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between Plug-and-Play methods and diffusion models for ill-posed inverse problems, specifically addressing their differences in denoising mechanisms and sampling procedures to create a more effective integration of learned priors with physical forward models.

Method: Decouples the diffusion process into three interpretable stages (denoising, data consistency enforcement, sampling) and proposes a hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style fidelity terms applied directly to the denoised estimate.

Result: Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better reconstruction quality compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The unified framework successfully integrates learned priors with physical models through a principled hybrid approach that maintains diffusion sampling trajectory while improving measurement consistency, offering superior performance for inverse problem solving.

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fully automatic two-stage framework for non-invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) grading using optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement from fundus ultrasound videos and clinical data integration, achieving superior accuracy over conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intracranial pressure monitoring is crucial but current invasive methods like lumbar puncture carry risks. Non-invasive ONSD measurement shows promise but suffers from manual operation inconsistencies, subjectivity, and thresholding variability.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Fundus ultrasound video processing with frame-level anatomical segmentation, rule-based keyframe identification, and precise ONSD measurement; 2) ICP grading by fusing ONSD metrics with clinical features for ICP grade prediction.

Result: Achieved validation accuracy of 0.845 ± 0.071 (five-fold cross-validation) and independent test accuracy of 0.786, significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method (0.637 ± 0.111 validation, 0.429 test accuracy).

Conclusion: The framework reduces operator variability and integrates multi-source information, establishing a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP evaluation with potential to improve patient management in acute neurological conditions.

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

*Botong Zhao,Qijun Shi,Shujing Lyu,Yue Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that extracts normal features from test images without external references, using reconstruction residuals to identify defects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defect segmentation methods rely on external normal references which are brittle for IC imagery due to layout variations and alignment difficulties across different products.

Method: Proposes a framework with a learnable normal-information extractor that aggregates normal features from test images, uses coherence loss to associate features with normal regions, and a decoder to reconstruct normal content. Defects are segmented through reconstruction residuals, with pseudo-anomaly augmentation for training stability.

Result: Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product variability.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised framework effectively segments IC defects without external normal support, demonstrating superior performance and robustness across diverse IC manufacturing stages and product variations.

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical vision-language models often learn task-agnostic correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports, limiting their generalizability and increasing failure risks in real-world clinical settings.

Method: Uses parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable prompt tokens to explicitly separate clinically relevant signals from noise. Curates high-quality image-text pairs by generating captions for diverse medical data to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Result: Improves in-distribution performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets.

Conclusion: Disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior under domain shift, contributing to safer, more trustworthy VLMs for clinical use.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more

TL;DR: FS-Diff is a novel joint image fusion and super-resolution method that uses semantic guidance and clarity-aware mechanisms to produce high-quality fused images with rich details and semantic information from multimodal inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image fusion techniques struggle with corrupted target/background structures, low resolution, and weak semantic information in real-world applications like military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions.

Method: Unifies image fusion and super-resolution as conditional generation using a modified U-Net network with bidirectional feature Mamba for global feature extraction, clarity sensing mechanism for adaptive perception, and random iterative denoising process.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods at multiple magnifications on six public datasets and a new AVMS benchmark, recovering richer details and semantics in fused images.

Conclusion: FS-Diff effectively addresses the challenges of joint image fusion and super-resolution through semantic guidance and clarity-aware mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses over-dispersion in dense self-supervised learning by proposing explicit semantic concentration through patch correspondence distillation with noise-tolerant ranking loss and object-aware filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream image-level SSL methods suffer from over-dispersion where patches from the same instance scatter, harming dense task performance. The authors aim to achieve explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL.

Method: Proposes two main techniques: 1) Distilling patch correspondences with noise-tolerant ranking loss that extends AP loss to continuous targets, and 2) Object-aware filter that maps output space to object-based space using learnable prototypes via cross-attention.

Result: Empirical studies across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing over-dispersion and improving dense SSL performance.

Conclusion: The proposed CoTAP method successfully achieves explicit semantic concentration for dense SSL, overcoming limitations of image-level SSL methods through patch correspondence distillation and object-aware filtering.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexiD-Fuse is a diffusion-based medical image fusion network that can handle flexible numbers of input modalities (2 or 3) with the same weights, overcoming limitations of fixed-input methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical image fusion methods only work with fixed numbers of input modalities, which limits clinical application where varying numbers of complementary medical images (different modalities) need to be fused for comprehensive diagnosis.

Method: Transforms diffusion fusion into maximum likelihood estimation using diffusion process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Incorporates Expectation-Maximization algorithm into diffusion sampling to generate fused images independent of input quantity.

Result: Achieves best performance on Harvard datasets with 9 evaluation metrics for medical image fusion with varying inputs. Also shows effectiveness on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus fusion tasks.

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse successfully addresses the limitation of fixed-input fusion methods and demonstrates superior performance across various medical and general image fusion tasks with flexible modality inputs.

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

TL;DR: A compact 3D Attention UNet model achieves strong glioma segmentation performance on limited African MRI data, demonstrating practical deployment potential for low-resource healthcare settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality annotated brain MRI data in Sub-Saharan Africa and the need for efficient glioma segmentation models suitable for resource-constrained clinical environments.

Method: 3D Attention UNet architecture with residual blocks, enhanced through transfer learning from pre-trained weights on BraTS 2021 dataset, evaluated on BraTS-Africa dataset with 95 MRI cases.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 0.76 (ET), 0.80 (NETC), and 0.85 (SNFH) despite limited data quality and quantity. Model size ~90 MB with sub-minute inference time on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates strong generalizability and practical deployment potential for low-resource settings, contributing to equitable AI in global health by providing accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive politically-focused deepfake detection dataset with 3M real images and 963k synthetic images from modern generative models, plus a crowdsourced adversarial platform to keep detection methods robust against evolving threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes intensify misinformation spread in political contexts, and existing detection datasets are limited by outdated generation methods, low realism, and single-face imagery, making them ineffective against modern synthetic media.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset with real images paired with captions, generated high-quality synthetic images using both proprietary and open-source models, and developed a crowdsourced adversarial platform where participants submit challenging synthetic images to test detection robustness.

Result: The dataset provides comprehensive benchmarking for modern deepfake detection, and the adversarial platform ensures continuous evaluation against evolving generative techniques that produce increasingly realistic synthetic content.

Conclusion: This community-driven approach proactively safeguards public discourse by maintaining robust and adaptive deepfake detection methods that can keep pace with sophisticated misinformation threats from rapidly advancing generative AI models.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

### [100] [Improving Human Motion Plausibility with Body Momentum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09496)
*Ha Linh Nguyen,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local joint motion with global movement, addressing the physical coupling between these components that existing motion models often fail to capture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion models treat local joint motion and global root movement separately, but these components are physically coupled through environmental interactions. Current approaches fail to precisely capture this relationship, while physics-based methods are computationally expensive.

Method: Introduces a new loss term that enforces consistency between generated momentum profiles and ground-truth data, using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a physically grounded constraint to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.

Result: The proposed approach reduces foot sliding and jitter, improves balance, and preserves motion accuracy while providing a computationally efficient solution compared to physics-based methods.

Conclusion: Momentum-based constraints provide an effective way to bridge local and global motion components, offering improved physical realism and motion quality without the computational complexity of full physics simulations.

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Transformer-based framework for predicting region-wise correspondence between manga line art images without pre-existing labels, achieving high patch-level accuracy and consistent region matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is fundamental for applications like automatic colorization and in-between frame generation, but remains unexplored in realistic scenarios without segmentation or annotations.

Method: Divide line art images into patches, use Transformer-based framework to learn patch-level similarities, apply edge-aware clustering and region matching algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into region-level correspondences.

Result: Achieves 96.34% patch-level accuracy on multiple datasets and generates consistent region-level correspondences.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates strong performance for real-world manga applications and provides a practical solution for region-wise correspondence prediction without pre-existing labels.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGDF method uses generative diffusion for robust multi-view clustering with noisy/missing data, achieving SOTA results with GDCN framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address low-quality data issues in multi-view clustering caused by noisy views and missing data, which degrade fusion performance.

Method: Proposes Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF) with multiple generative mechanism for multi-view features, and builds Generative Diffusion Contrastive Network (GDCN) on top.

Result: Extensive experiments show GDCN achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.

Conclusion: SGDF effectively handles low-quality multi-view data through generative diffusion, and GDCN framework demonstrates superior clustering performance.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly
available at https://github.com/HackerHyper/GDCN.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualTrack is a novel dual-encoder architecture for sensorless 3D ultrasound that decouples local and global feature extraction to achieve state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction accuracy below 5mm error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D ultrasound systems are costly and complex, limiting widespread adoption. Sensorless 3D US using deep learning is promising but previous approaches either ignore global features or tightly couple them with local features, restricting robust modeling of both complementary aspects.

Method: DualTrack uses separate local and global encoders: a local encoder with dense spatiotemporal convolutions for fine-grained features, and a global encoder with image backbone and temporal attention for high-level anatomical features. A lightweight fusion module combines these to estimate probe trajectory.

Result: Experimental results on a large public benchmark show DualTrack achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with average reconstruction error below 5mm, outperforming previous methods and yielding globally consistent 3D reconstructions.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-encoder architecture successfully decouples local and global feature extraction, demonstrating that specialized encoders for different scales of features can significantly improve 3D ultrasound reconstruction accuracy and consistency.

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight
fusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.
Experimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,
outperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error
below 5 mm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models have focused on architectural innovations and training objectives, but less attention has been paid to improving feature representation power. The authors propose that aligning intermediate features with pre-trained vision encoders can benefit video generation.

Method: Proposed Align4Gen with a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into video diffusion model training. Conducted in-depth analysis of various vision encoders using a new metric to evaluate discriminability and temporal consistency for video feature alignment.

Result: Align4Gen shows improved video generation performance for both unconditional and class-conditional video generation tasks, as quantified by various metrics.

Conclusion: Feature alignment with pre-trained vision encoders is beneficial for video diffusion models, and the proposed Align4Gen framework effectively integrates this approach to enhance video generation quality.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Conclusion: InterAct provides a comprehensive benchmark that addresses dataset limitations in 3D human-object interactions, enabling advanced research in HOI generation through high-quality data, standardized annotations, and methodological advancements.

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates shortcut learning and demographic bias in deep learning-based Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI scans, demonstrating that DL models can identify race and sex from brain MRIs and exhibit performance bias against underrepresented groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning algorithms for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis from MRI can suffer from shortcut learning where spurious features related to protected attributes (race, sex) are used for prediction, potentially leading to performance bias against underrepresented demographic groups.

Method: Researchers investigated if DL algorithms can identify race/sex from 3D brain MRI scans, examined whether training set imbalance causes performance drops indicating bias, and conducted quantitative/qualitative analysis of feature attributions using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet and SwinTransformer).

Result: The study demonstrated the existence of both race and sex-based shortcut learning and bias in DL-based AD classification, showing that models can identify demographic attributes from brain MRIs and exhibit performance disparities across demographic groups.

Conclusion: This work establishes the foundation for developing fairer deep learning diagnostic tools in brain MRI by identifying and characterizing demographic bias in AD classification models, with code provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in remote sensing change detection including pseudo changes, limited labeled samples, and cross-domain generalization difficulties.

Method: Uses weight-sharing Siamese encoder from VFMs (SAM2 and DINOv3) with integrated LoRA and Adapter modules for efficient adaptation, plus lightweight decoder.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: SYSU-CD (73.81% IoU), WHUCD (92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%), LEVIR-CD (85.62%) with precise boundaries and pseudo-change suppression.

Conclusion: PeftCD provides optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, offering scalable paradigm for real-world remote sensing change detection applications.

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable

Motivation: Event cameras offer microsecond precision and reliability under challenging conditions, but their integration with natural language understanding remains unexplored, creating a gap in multimodal perception for dynamic scenes.

Method: Built on real-world driving scenarios, the benchmark includes carefully validated referring expressions with four structured attributes: appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to surrounding objects to capture spatial, temporal and relational cues.

Result: The benchmark comprises 5,567 scenes, 13,458 annotated objects, and over 30,000 validated referring expressions with attribute-centric design for interpretable and compositional grounding.

Conclusion: Talk2Event serves as a foundation for advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications in robotics and human-AI interaction, enabling contextual reasoning beyond simple object recognition in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar is a cascaded framework that unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic avatar video generation, using an MLLM director for high-level semantics and parallel sub-clip generation for long-duration, high-quality videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing audio-driven avatar methods treat instructions as low-level tracking without modeling communicative purpose, compromising narrative coherence and character expressiveness.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) MLLM director produces blueprint video from multimodal instructions, 2) Parallel sub-clip generation using first-last frame strategy guided by blueprint keyframes.

Result: Generates vivid, fluent 1080p videos at 48 fps with superior lip sync, emotion expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar establishes a new benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar synthesis suitable for real-world applications like digital human livestreaming.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is crucial for clinical decision-making in neuro-oncology, especially in data-limited scenarios.

Method: Combines mechanistic ODE-based tumor growth model (capturing radiotherapy effects) with gradient-guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) for anatomically feasible MRI synthesis.

Result: Generates realistic follow-up scans with good spatial similarity metrics and tumor growth probability maps showing clinically relevant extent and directionality (95th percentile Hausdorff Distance).

Conclusion: Enables biologically informed image generation that accounts for mechanistic priors, providing generative-space-time predictions for brain tumor progression.

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Motivation: Existing benchmarks only test recognition accuracy but overlook the critical capability of epistemic humility - recognizing when none of provided options are correct, which is essential for trustworthy AI in real-world applications.

Method: Built from panoptic scene graph dataset using fine-grained annotations to extract ground-truth entities/relations. GPT-4-Turbo generates multiple-choice questions with "None of the above" option, followed by rigorous manual filtering. Evaluates three hallucination types: object, relation, and attribute.

Conclusion: HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites by incorporating explicit false-option rejection, addressing hallucination risks and providing better assessment of MLLM trustworthiness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and

TL;DR: UAE framework unifies image understanding (encoder) and generation (decoder) through bidirectional training with reconstruction fidelity as the unified objective, using RL to create mutual gains between caption generation and image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified multimodal learning framework that bridges image understanding and generation through coherent bidirectional information flow, addressing the gap between separate understanding and generation models.

Method: Proposes UAE framework with: 1) Pre-training decoder with long-context image captions, 2) Unified-GRPO RL with three stages: cold-start initialization, generation for understanding (encoder trained to produce informative captions), and understanding for generation (decoder refined to reconstruct from detailed captions).

Result: The framework demonstrates that as RL progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions while the decoder shows improved ability to understand intricate descriptions, resulting in high-fidelity reconstructions.

Conclusion: The paper presents a novel unified approach to multimodal learning where understanding and generation mutually reinforce each other through bidirectional training, achieving striking reconstruction fidelity and introducing the first benchmark (Unified-Bench) for assessing unification in multimodal models.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NRMF is a novel 3D generative human motion prior that uses neural distance fields to model pose, velocity, and acceleration dynamics on Riemannian manifolds, enabling robust and physically plausible motion recovery across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAE and diffusion-based motion priors lack explicit modeling of physical dynamics and geometric constraints. The authors aim to create a more rigorous motion prior that respects the underlying geometry of human articulations and ensures temporal consistency and physical plausibility.

Method: The method constructs neural distance fields (NDFs) on the product space of joint rotations, angular velocities, and accelerations. It introduces an adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projection onto plausible motions and a geometric integrator for realistic motion trajectory generation.

Result: NRMF demonstrates significant improvements in motion recovery tasks including denoising, motion in-betweening, and fitting to partial 2D/3D observations. It shows remarkable generalization across multiple input modalities when trained on the AMASS dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural Riemannian Motion Fields provide a robust and physically plausible framework for 3D human motion generation and recovery, outperforming existing methods by explicitly modeling motion dynamics on appropriate geometric manifolds.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

### [114] [Locality in Image Diffusion Models Emerges from Data Statistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09672)
*Artem Lukoianov,Chenyang Yuan,Justin Solomon,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper shows that locality in deep diffusion models emerges from statistical properties of image datasets rather than convolutional neural network inductive biases, and develops an improved analytical denoiser.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep diffusion models differ from the theoretically optimal denoiser and to determine whether the performance gap stems from dataset statistics or architectural biases.

Method: The authors demonstrate that an optimal parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to deep neural denoisers, analyze pixel correlations in natural images theoretically and experimentally, and craft an improved analytical denoiser based on these insights.

Result: The research shows that locality emerges from pixel correlations in natural image datasets, not from convolutional network biases. The new analytical denoiser better matches deep diffusion model scores than prior expert-crafted alternatives.

Conclusion: The performance gap between optimal denoisers and deep diffusion models is primarily due to statistical properties of image datasets rather than architectural inductive biases, enabling more accurate analytical modeling of diffusion behavior.

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

TL;DR: SpatialVID is a large-scale dataset of 7,089 hours of diverse real-world videos with dense 3D annotations including camera poses, depth maps, and motion instructions, addressing the scarcity of high-quality training data for spatial intelligence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial intelligence models are constrained by limited training data that lacks scale, diversity, and rich annotations, especially for real-world dynamic scenes with ground-truth camera motion.

Method: Collected over 21,000 hours of raw video, processed through hierarchical filtering into 2.7 million clips, and annotated with camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured captions, and serialized motion instructions.

Result: Created SpatialVID dataset with 7,089 hours of diverse dynamic content featuring comprehensive spatial and semantic annotations that enable improved model generalization.

Conclusion: SpatialVID's richness and diversity make it a key asset for advancing video and 3D vision research by providing large-scale, high-quality training data for spatial intelligence tasks.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours
of raw video, and process them into 2.7 million clips through a hierarchical
filtering pipeline, totaling 7,089 hours of dynamic content. A subsequent
annotation pipeline enriches these clips with detailed spatial and semantic
information, including camera poses, depth maps, dynamic masks, structured
captions, and serialized motion instructions. Analysis of SpatialVID's data
statistics reveals a richness and diversity that directly foster improved model
generalization and performance, establishing it as a key asset for the video

TL;DR: OmniEVA addresses geometric adaptability and embodiment constraint gaps in MLLM-based embodied systems through task-adaptive 3D grounding and embodiment-aware reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM-based embodied systems suffer from geometric adaptability gaps (insufficient spatial information or restricted 2D generalization) and embodiment constraint gaps (neglecting real robot physical constraints), leading to poor adaptability and infeasible task plans.

Method: Introduces two innovations: (1) Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding mechanism with gated router for selective 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, and (2) Embodiment-Aware Reasoning framework that incorporates both task goals and physical constraints into reasoning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning performance and demonstrates strong ability across diverse downstream scenarios, including both primitive and composite tasks.

Conclusion: OmniEVA provides robust and versatile planning capabilities for embodied intelligence by addressing critical limitations in current MLLM-based systems through context-aware 3D grounding and embodiment-constrained reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

TL;DR: SimpleVLA-RL is an efficient RL framework that enhances Vision-Language-Action models, reducing reliance on expensive human demonstration data while improving generalization and achieving state-of-the-art performance on robotic manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in VLA models: (1) scarcity and high cost of large-scale human-operated robotic trajectories for supervised fine-tuning, and (2) limited generalization to tasks with distribution shift. Inspired by how RL improved reasoning in Large Reasoning Models.

Method: Built upon veRL framework with VLA-specific enhancements: trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment rendering, and optimized loss computation. Applied to OpenVLA-OFT with exploration-enhancing strategies.

Result: Achieved SoTA performance on LIBERO benchmark and outperformed baseline (π₀) on RoboTwin 1.0 & 2.0. Reduced dependence on large-scale data, enabled robust generalization, and surpassed SFT in real-world tasks. Discovered novel "pushcut" phenomenon during RL training.

Conclusion: RL can significantly improve VLA models' long-horizon action planning, offering a more data-efficient and generalizable approach than traditional supervised fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

*Sourav Garg,Dustin Craggs,Vineeth Bhat,Lachlan Mares,Stefan Podgorski,Madhava Krishna,Feras Dayoub,Ian Reid*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Object-relative visual navigation using topological maps and object-level representations instead of image-level matching, enabling better generalization across embodiments and trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image-relative navigation approaches are limited by being tied to specific agent poses and embodiments, while object representations offer more invariant world representations that can handle cross-embodiment deployment and new routes without strict imitation.

Method: Proposes a topometric map using relative 3D scene graphs for object-level global path planning, and trains a local controller (ObjectReact) conditioned on WayObject Costmap representation instead of RGB input, eliminating explicit image matching.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance over image-relative methods across sensor height variations and challenging navigation tasks (like reverse direction navigation), with sim-only policy generalizing well to real-world indoor environments.

Conclusion: Object-relative control paradigm provides significant advantages in invariance, generalization, and decoupling control from image matching, making it a promising approach for robust visual navigation across different embodiments and environments.

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

TL;DR: Dexplore is a unified optimization method that learns robot control policies directly from human motion capture data by jointly performing retargeting and tracking, treating demonstrations as soft guidance rather than ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-object motion-capture repositories offer large-scale demonstrations but have inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human and robot hands. Existing three-stage methods (retargeting, tracking, residual correction) underuse demonstrations and compound errors.

Method: Single-loop optimization that jointly performs retargeting and tracking using reinforcement learning. Derives adaptive spatial scopes from raw trajectories and trains policies to stay in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing tasks.

Result: Preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific strategies, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large demonstration corpora. Distills into vision-based generative controller supporting generalization across objects.

Conclusion: Dexplore provides a principled bridge that transforms imperfect human demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

TL;DR: Proposes bona fide cross-testing framework to address imbalanced weighting in audio deepfake detection evaluation, using diverse bona fide datasets and aggregated EERs for more reliable assessments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional audio deepfake detection evaluation disproportionately weights synthesizers with more samples and lacks diversity in bona fide speech, limiting real-world applicability and reliability.

Method: Developed bona fide cross-testing framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and aggregates EERs across multiple synthesizers for balanced evaluation.

Result: Benchmarked over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types, demonstrating improved robustness and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation framework provides more reliable and balanced assessment of audio deepfake detection models, with a new dataset released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) models are commonly evaluated using datasets
that combine multiple synthesizers, with performance reported as a single Equal
Error Rate (EER). However, this approach disproportionately weights
synthesizers with more samples, underrepresenting others and reducing the
overall reliability of EER. Additionally, most ADD datasets lack diversity in
bona fide speech, often featuring a single environment and speech style (e.g.,
clean read speech), limiting their ability to simulate real-world conditions.
To address these challenges, we propose bona fide cross-testing, a novel
evaluation framework that incorporates diverse bona fide datasets and
aggregates EERs for more balanced assessments. Our approach improves robustness
and interpretability compared to traditional evaluation methods. We benchmark
over 150 synthesizers across nine bona fide speech types and release a new

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DiFlow-TTS is the first discrete flow matching model for zero-shot TTS that achieves fast inference (25.8x speedup) while maintaining high quality in naturalness, prosody, and speaker style preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot TTS methods suffer from slow inference and repetition artifacts, and current flow-matching approaches embed discrete tokens into continuous space rather than fully leveraging discrete representations.

Method: Uses purely discrete flow matching with factorized speech attributes, in-context learning from reference speech, and separate prediction heads for prosody and acoustic details.

Result: Achieves promising performance in naturalness, prosody, speaker style preservation, and energy control while maintaining compact model size and generating speech 25.8x faster than baselines.

Conclusion: Discrete flow matching is effective for zero-shot TTS, enabling fast inference and high-quality attribute cloning without the limitations of continuous space modeling.

Abstract: Zero-shot Text-to-Speech (TTS) aims to synthesize high-quality speech that
mimics the voice of an unseen speaker using only a short reference sample,
requiring not only speaker adaptation but also accurate modeling of prosodic
attributes. Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow
matching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from
slow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have
been widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to
explore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential
of discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing
flow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous
space and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the
advantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we
introduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model
to explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS
explicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified
architecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual
content, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference
speech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In
addition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with
distinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn
aspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS
achieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,
prosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a
compact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to
25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Using MCTS-derived trajectories to improve policy optimization in preference-based RL through staged GRPO training with tree-structured advantage estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage MCTS-generated intermediate trajectories (effective in math/symbolic reasoning) to enhance policy optimization in preference-based RL, moving beyond traditional value/reward model training.

Method: Propose staged GRPO training using partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing tree-structured advantage estimation and prefix-conditioned reward signals.

Result: Structured advantage estimation stabilizes updates and better reflects compositional reasoning quality, but faces challenges like advantage saturation and reward signal collapse.

Conclusion: While promising, the approach requires heuristic and statistical solutions to address identified challenges, with open questions remaining for learning under tree-like reward structures.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have shown the
effectiveness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for generating high-quality
intermediate trajectories, particularly in math and symbolic domains. Inspired
by this, we explore how MCTS-derived trajectories, traditionally used for
training value or reward models, can be repurposed to improve policy
optimization in preference-based reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we
focus on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent algorithm that
enables preference-consistent policy learning without value networks. We
propose a staged GRPO training paradigm where completions are derived from
partially revealed MCTS rollouts, introducing a novel tree-structured setting
for advantage estimation. This leads to a rich class of prefix-conditioned
reward signals, which we analyze theoretically and empirically. Our initial
results indicate that while structured advantage estimation can stabilize
updates and better reflect compositional reasoning quality, challenges such as
advantage saturation and reward signal collapse remain. We propose heuristic
and statistical solutions to mitigate these issues and discuss open challenges
for learning under staged or tree-like reward structures.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes a neuroscience-inspired computational framework for agentic spatial intelligence, identifying six essential modules to bridge the gap between current AI systems and human-like spatial reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic AI systems have limited spatial reasoning abilities constrained to symbolic processing, while human spatial intelligence enables flexible decision-making in unstructured environments. Bridging this gap is critical for advancing interaction with the physical 3D world.

Method: The authors introduce a computational framework grounded in neuroscience principles, mapping biological functions to six modules: bio-inspired multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric conversion, artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning. They conduct framework-guided analysis of existing methods and benchmarks.

Result: The paper provides a structured perspective landscape for agentic spatial reasoning across virtual and physical environments, identifies critical gaps in current approaches, and examines emerging benchmarks and application domains including robotics.

Conclusion: The work outlines a neuroscience-grounded roadmap for developing spatial reasoning capabilities that can generalize across dynamic or unstructured environments, providing the research community with a structured pathway for advancing agentic spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task
execution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities
remain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and
sequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in
integrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables
flexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.
Therefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial
Intelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,
we first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in
computational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational
framework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core
biological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired
multimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric
conversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.
Together, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial
reasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we
conduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their
relevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the
development of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further
examine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application
domains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we
outline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that
can generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.
We hope this work will benefit the research community with a
neuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway. Our project page

TL;DR: Study identifies key indicators for agro-tourism growth using machine learning feature selection methods, with LASSO combined with Logistic Regression achieving 98-99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agro-tourism is a strategic economic model for rural development that diversifies income streams while conserving cultural heritage and traditional practices. There's a need to study growth strategies in detail.

Method: Two-phase study: 1) Comprehensive literature review to identify important indicators/features, 2) Application of machine learning feature selection techniques including LASSO method combined with classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) on different train-test splits.

Result: LASSO with Logistic Regression achieved highest classification accuracy: 98% in 70-30% train-test data and 99% in 80-20% train-test data. Random Forest achieved 95% accuracy, while Decision Trees and XGBoost achieved 97% accuracy in the 80-20 split.

Conclusion: Machine learning feature selection methods, particularly LASSO combined with Logistic Regression, are effective for identifying key indicators and predicting agro-tourism growth with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for strategic development.

Abstract: Agro-tourism serves as a strategic economic model designed to facilitate
rural development by diversifying income streams for local communities like
farmers while promoting the conservation of indigenous cultural heritage and
traditional agricultural practices. As a very booming subdomain of tourism,
there is a need to study the strategies for the growth of Agro-tourism in
detail. The current study has identified the important indicators for the
growth and enhancement of agro-tourism. The study is conducted in two phases:
identification of the important indicators through a comprehensive literature
review and in the second phase state-of-the-art techniques were used to
identify the important indicators for the growth of agro-tourism. The
indicators are also called features synonymously, the machine learning models
for feature selection were applied and it was observed that the Least Absolute
Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method combined with, the machine
Learning Classifiers such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT),
Random Forest (RF) Tree, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST) models were
used to suggest the growth of the agro-tourism. The results show that with the
LASSO method, LR model gives the highest classification accuracy of 98% in
70-30% train-test data followed by RF with 95% accuracy. Similarly, in the
80-20% train-test data LR maintains the highest accuracy at 99%, while DT and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EMPG framework addresses LLM policy gradient issues by modulating updates based on action confidence and task outcomes, achieving better performance in long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents struggle with sparse rewards in long-horizon tasks, and traditional policy gradients have inefficient learning dynamics where update magnitudes are coupled with entropy, leading to small updates for confident correct actions and unstable large updates for uncertain ones.

Method: Proposes Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG) that recalibrates learning signals based on step-wise uncertainty and final task outcomes. It amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors, attenuates uncertain step updates, and includes a future clarity bonus to encourage predictable solution paths.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search tasks show EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly outperforms strong policy gradient baselines.

Conclusion: EMPG effectively addresses the fundamental learning dynamics problem in LLMs by modulating policy gradients based on uncertainty, leading to more stable and efficient learning in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards.

Abstract: In long-horizon tasks, recent agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs)
face a significant challenge that sparse, outcome-based rewards make it
difficult to assign credit to intermediate steps. Previous methods mainly focus
on creating dense reward signals to guide learning, either through traditional
reinforcement learning techniques like inverse reinforcement learning or by
using Process Reward Models for step-by-step feedback. In this paper, we
identify a fundamental problem in the learning dynamics of LLMs: the magnitude
of policy gradients is inherently coupled with the entropy, which leads to
inefficient small updates for confident correct actions and potentially
destabilizes large updates for uncertain ones. To resolve this, we propose
Entropy-Modulated Policy Gradients (EMPG), a framework that re-calibrates the
learning signal based on step-wise uncertainty and the final task outcome. EMPG
amplifies updates for confident correct actions, penalizes confident errors,
and attenuates updates from uncertain steps to stabilize exploration. We
further introduce a bonus term for future clarity that encourages agents to
find more predictable solution paths. Through comprehensive experiments on
three challenging agent tasks, WebShop, ALFWorld, and Deep Search, we
demonstrate that EMPG achieves substantial performance gains and significantly
outperforms strong policy gradient baselines. Project page is at

### [128] [LLMs Don't Know Their Own Decision Boundaries: The Unreliability of Self-Generated Counterfactual Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09396)
*Harry Mayne,Ryan Othniel Kearns,Yushi Yang,Andrew M. Bean,Eoin Delaney,Chris Russell,Adam Mahdi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can generate valid counterfactual explanations but struggle with minimality - they either make excessive edits or tiny edits that don't change predictions, creating a validity-minimality trade-off that limits their effectiveness as explainability tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective human-AI collaboration, language models need to explain their decisions in natural language through self-generated counterfactual explanations that show what input changes would lead to different outcomes.

Method: Evaluated whether LLMs can produce valid (achieve intended outcome) and minimal (modify input as little as possible) counterfactual explanations across multiple LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings.

Result: LLMs typically produce valid but non-minimal counterfactuals, and when asked for minimal ones, they make excessively small edits that fail to change predictions, showing a consistent validity-minimality trade-off.

Conclusion: Self-generated counterfactual explanations are ineffective explainability tools that can provide misleading insights, raising concerns about deploying LLMs in high-stakes settings where unreliable self-explanations could impact decision-making.

Abstract: To collaborate effectively with humans, language models must be able to
explain their decisions in natural language. We study a specific type of
self-explanation: self-generated counterfactual explanations (SCEs), where a
model explains its prediction by modifying the input such that it would have
predicted a different outcome. We evaluate whether LLMs can produce SCEs that
are valid, achieving the intended outcome, and minimal, modifying the input no
more than necessary. When asked to generate counterfactuals, we find that LLMs
typically produce SCEs that are valid, but far from minimal, offering little
insight into their decision-making behaviour. Worryingly, when asked to
generate minimal counterfactuals, LLMs typically make excessively small edits
that fail to change predictions. The observed validity-minimality trade-off is
consistent across several LLMs, datasets, and evaluation settings. Our findings
suggest that SCEs are, at best, an ineffective explainability tool and, at
worst, can provide misleading insights into model behaviour. Proposals to
deploy LLMs in high-stakes settings must consider the impact of unreliable
self-explanations on downstream decision-making. Our code is available at

*Bingxin Xu,Zhen Dong,Oussama Elachqar,Yuzhang Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ButterflyQuant replaces fixed Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms for layer-adaptive 2-bit quantization, achieving better performance than previous methods with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic performance loss due to activation outliers. Existing rotation-based methods use fixed transforms that cannot adapt to specific layer-wise outlier patterns in transformer models.

Method: Proposes ButterflyQuant with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by continuous Givens rotation angles, enabling smooth optimization while guaranteeing orthogonality. Uses uniformity regularization on post-transformation activations and requires only 128 calibration samples.

Result: Achieves 15.4 perplexity on LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit quantization, significantly outperforming QuaRot's 22.1 perplexity. Maintains O(n log n) computational complexity with only (n log n)/2 learnable parameters.

Conclusion: Layer-adaptive butterfly transforms effectively suppress outliers for extreme quantization, providing substantial performance improvements over fixed rotation methods with minimal one-time learning cost.

Abstract: Large language models require massive memory footprints, severely limiting
deployment on consumer hardware. Quantization reduces memory through lower
numerical precision, but extreme 2-bit quantization suffers from catastrophic
performance loss due to outliers in activations. Rotation-based methods such as
QuIP and QuaRot apply orthogonal transforms to eliminate outliers before
quantization, using computational invariance: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Wx} =
(\mathbf{WQ}^T)(\mathbf{Qx})$ for orthogonal $\mathbf{Q}$. However, these
methods use fixed transforms--Hadamard matrices achieving optimal worst-case
coherence $\mu = 1/\sqrt{n}$--that cannot adapt to specific weight
distributions. We identify that different transformer layers exhibit distinct
outlier patterns, motivating layer-adaptive rotations rather than
one-size-fits-all approaches. We propose ButterflyQuant, which replaces
Hadamard rotations with learnable butterfly transforms parameterized by
continuous Givens rotation angles. Unlike Hadamard's discrete $\{+1, -1\}$
entries that are non-differentiable and prohibit gradient-based learning,
butterfly transforms' continuous parameterization enables smooth optimization
while guaranteeing orthogonality by construction. This orthogonal constraint
ensures theoretical guarantees in outlier suppression while achieving $O(n \log
n)$ computational complexity with only $\frac{n \log n}{2}$ learnable
parameters. We further introduce a uniformity regularization on
post-transformation activations to promote smoother distributions amenable to
quantization. Learning requires only 128 calibration samples and converges in
minutes on a single GPU--a negligible one-time cost. On LLaMA-2-7B with 2-bit
quantization, ButterflyQuant achieves 15.4 perplexity versus 22.1 for QuaRot.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) attribution methods by representing them as modified gradient matrices, deriving bounds for singular values and attribution values, and showing that LRP-beta's convergence constants remain independent of weight norms unlike gradient-based methods and LRP-epsilon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the numerical properties and distribution characteristics of LRP-type attribution methods, particularly how attribution values behave and converge in practical applications with data augmentations.

Method: Represent LRP attribution methods as products of modified gradient matrices, derive upper bounds for singular values and component-wise bounds for attribution values, and analyze convergence constants for empirical means of attributions.

Result: The analysis reveals that LRP-beta's multiplicative constants governing convergence remain independent of weight norms, which distinguishes it from both gradient-based methods and LRP-epsilon.

Conclusion: LRP-beta exhibits favorable numerical properties with weight-norm-independent convergence constants, making it particularly suitable for scenarios involving multiple non-geometric data augmentations and Smoothgrad-type attribution methods.

Abstract: We analyze numerical properties of Layer-wise relevance propagation
(LRP)-type attribution methods by representing them as a product of modified
gradient matrices. This representation creates an analogy to matrix
multiplications of Jacobi-matrices which arise from the chain rule of
differentiation. In order to shed light on the distribution of attribution
values, we derive upper bounds for singular values. Furthermore we derive
component-wise bounds for attribution map values. As a main result, we apply
these component-wise bounds to obtain multiplicative constants. These constants
govern the convergence of empirical means of attributions to expectations of
attribution maps. This finding has important implications for scenarios where
multiple non-geometric data augmentations are applied to individual test
samples, as well as for Smoothgrad-type attribution methods. In particular, our
analysis reveals that the constants for LRP-beta remain independent of weight
norms, a significant distinction from both gradient-based methods and
LRP-epsilon.

*Omar Erak,Omar Alhussein,Hatem Abou-Zeid,Mehdi Bennis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training-free adaptive token merging for vision transformers in semantic communication systems, using Bayesian optimization to balance accuracy and computational efficiency across varying channel conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large transformer models are powerful for semantic communication but too computationally expensive for resource-constrained 6G networks, requiring efficient deployment solutions.

Method: Formulates token merging as multi-objective optimization, uses Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to find Pareto-optimal configurations for adaptive runtime merging.

Result: Outperforms baselines with significant FLOPs reduction while maintaining competitive accuracy across various SNR conditions; adaptive policies effectively trade latency for semantic fidelity.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems with flexible runtime adaptation.

Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic
communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations
for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial
computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in
resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free
framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to
jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the
selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization
problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian
process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal
configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application
requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant
reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional
results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging
aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism
to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish
a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic
communication in future edge intelligence systems.

*Md Tanveer Hossain Munim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DART framework addresses the Statistical Similarity Trap in weather forecasting by using dual-decoder architecture to improve extreme convection detection, achieving 270% improvement and better operational performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics reward blurry predictions while missing rare high-impact weather events, creating a Statistical Similarity Trap that fails to detect dangerous convection.

Method: DART (Dual Architecture for Regression Tasks) uses dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition, physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions to transform coarse forecasts into high-resolution satellite data optimized for extreme convection detection.

Result: DART achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines, shows 270% improvement in extreme convection detection by removing Integrated Water Vapor Transport (IVT Paradox), and validates on real-world Chittagong flooding case. Trains in under 10 minutes on standard hardware.

Conclusion: DART provides the first systematic solution for hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling tasks in weather forecasting, enabling precise operational calibration and demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather preparedness.

Abstract: Current evaluation metrics for deep learning weather models create a
"Statistical Similarity Trap", rewarding blurry predictions while missing rare,
high-impact events. We provide quantitative evidence of this trap, showing
sophisticated baselines achieve 97.9% correlation yet 0.00 CSI for dangerous
convection detection. We introduce DART (Dual Architecture for Regression
Tasks), a framework addressing the challenge of transforming coarse atmospheric
forecasts into high-resolution satellite brightness temperature fields
optimized for extreme convection detection (below 220 K). DART employs
dual-decoder architecture with explicit background/extreme decomposition,
physically motivated oversampling, and task-specific loss functions. We present
four key findings: (1) empirical validation of the Statistical Similarity Trap
across multiple sophisticated baselines; (2) the "IVT Paradox", removing
Integrated Water Vapor Transport, widely regarded as essential for atmospheric
river analysis, improves extreme convection detection by 270%; (3)
architectural necessity demonstrated through operational flexibility (DART
achieves CSI = 0.273 with bias = 2.52 vs. 6.72 for baselines at equivalent
CSI), and (4) real-world validation with the August 2023 Chittagong flooding
disaster as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically address this hybrid conversion-segmentation-downscaling task,
with no direct prior benchmarks identified in existing literature. Our
validation against diverse statistical and deep learning baselines sufficiently
demonstrates DART's specialized design. The framework enables precise
operational calibration through beta-tuning, trains in under 10 minutes on
standard hardware, and integrates seamlessly with existing meteorological
workflows, demonstrating a pathway toward trustworthy AI for extreme weather
preparedness.

*Maysam Behmanesh,Erkan Turan,Maks Ovsjanikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel graph alignment framework that enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency across latent spaces, outperforming existing unsupervised methods and generalizing to vision-language domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised graph alignment methods suffer from node distinctiveness degradation due to GNN oversmoothing and latent space misalignment caused by structural noise, feature heterogeneity, and training instability.

Method: Dual-pass encoder combining low-pass and high-pass spectral filters for discriminative embeddings, plus geometry-aware functional map module for bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings.

Result: Outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines on graph benchmarks with superior robustness to structural inconsistencies, and effectively generalizes to vision-language alignment using diverse pretrained models.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key limitations in graph alignment by simultaneously enhancing node distinctiveness and enforcing geometric consistency, demonstrating strong performance across domains.

Abstract: Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across
multiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing
unsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable
cross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these
methods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node
distinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the
misalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature
heterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node
correspondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that
simultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency
across latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines
low-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both
structure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space
misalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns
bijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring
consistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive
experiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior
robustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.
Additionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using
diverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes
beyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language
representations.

*Harshit Agrawal,Ari Hietanen,Simo Särkkä*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: This study optimizes deep learning-based scatter correction for CBCT by applying networks at varying resolutions, achieving 78x reduction in FLOPs while maintaining comparable performance, enabling deployment on mobile/edge devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scatter artifacts degrade CBCT image quality, and existing deep learning methods have large memory footprints that limit deployment on mobile CBCT systems and edge devices.

Method: Examined reconstruction error in CBCT scatter signal at six resolutions using four interpolation methods, then trained state-of-the-art method across five image resolutions to evaluate FLOPs, inference times, and GPU memory reductions.

Result: Achieved 78-fold reduction in FLOPs while maintaining comparable performance (MAPE: 3.85% vs 4.42%, MSE: 1.34e-2 vs 2.01e-2), with 16x faster inference and 12x less GPU memory usage. Demonstrated robustness on simulated and real CBCT scans.

Conclusion: Downsampling plays an underappreciated role in deep learning-based scatter estimation, enabling substantial resource reduction for scatter correction in mobile CBCT and edge devices.

Abstract: Purpose: Scatter artifacts drastically degrade the image quality of cone-beam
computed tomography (CBCT) scans. Although deep learning-based methods show
promise in estimating scatter from CBCT measurements, their deployment in
mobile CBCT systems or edge devices is still limited due to the large memory
footprint of the networks. This study addresses the issue by applying networks
at varying resolutions and suggesting an optimal one, based on speed and
accuracy.
  Methods: First, the reconstruction error in down-up sampling of CBCT scatter
signal was examined at six resolutions by comparing four interpolation methods.
Next, a recent state-of-the-art method was trained across five image
resolutions and evaluated for the reductions in floating-point operations
(FLOPs), inference times, and GPU memory requirements.
  Results: Reducing the input size and network parameters achieved a 78-fold
reduction in FLOPs compared to the baseline method, while maintaining comarable
performance in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error (MAPE) and
mean-square-error (MSE). Specifically, the MAPE decreased to 3.85% compared to
4.42%, and the MSE decreased to 1.34 \times 10^{-2} compared to 2.01 \times
10^{-2}. Inference time and GPU memory usage were reduced by factors of 16 and
12, respectively. Further experiments comparing scatter-corrected
reconstructions on a large, simulated dataset and real CBCT scans from water
and Sedentex CT phantoms clearly demonstrated the robustness of our method.
  Conclusion: This study highlights the underappreciated role of downsampling
in deep learning-based scatter estimation. The substantial reduction in FLOPs
and GPU memory requirements achieved by our method enables scatter correction
in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile CBCT and edge devices.

TL;DR: CameraVDP framework combines camera-based display measurement with visual difference prediction to enable perceptual assessment of display artifacts, addressing limitations of traditional sparse sampling methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional display measurement methods using sparse radiometric sampling fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions, while cameras introduce optical and photometric distortions. There's a need to combine physical measurement with visual system modeling to assess visible distortions.

Method: Proposes a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with HDR image stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion, homography transformation, and color correction. Incorporates Visual Difference Predictor (VDP) to model visibility of stimuli under different viewing conditions for human visual system.

Result: Validated through three applications: defective pixel detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. The uncertainty analysis framework provides theoretical upper bounds for defect detection and confidence intervals for VDP quality scores.

Conclusion: CameraVDP enables cameras to function as precise display measurement instruments by accounting for both camera measurement inaccuracies and visual difference prediction, providing a comprehensive framework for perceptual display assessment.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.

Method: Developed data-driven framework using explainable AI with guided recursive feature elimination to identify optimal 8-feature subset from original 15-feature protocol. Validated in vivo and benchmarked against full acquisition and alternative reduction strategies.

Result: Reduced protocol yielded parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to full protocol, with low estimation errors and minimal impact on test-retest variability. Showed superior robustness with over two-fold reduction in water exchange time estimation deviation compared to other reduction schemes.

Conclusion: The hybrid optimization framework enables viable neurite exchange imaging in 14 minutes without loss of parameter fidelity, supporting broader application of exchange-sensitive diffusion MRI in neuroscience and clinical research.

Abstract: The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework
for probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as
compartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time.
However, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a
reduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model
accuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a
data-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided
recursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset
from a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was
validated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative
reduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,
and test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded
parameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low
estimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest
variability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the
optimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in
water exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid
optimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes
without loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader
application of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in
neuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for
designing efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.

### [137] [DeepTV: A neural network approach for total variation minimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05569)
*Andreas Langer,Sara Behnamian*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: Neural networks for solving infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problems face theoretical issues with solution existence, so an auxiliary neural network approach with Γ-convergence guarantees is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks have shown success in solving PDEs (e.g., physics-informed neural networks, Deep Ritz method), but their application to infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problems presents theoretical challenges regarding solution existence.

Method: Propose an auxiliary neural network problem that has a solution and prove its Γ-convergence to the original problem. Also develop a discrete version of the auxiliary problem and show its Γ-convergence, connecting it to finite difference discretization.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows the auxiliary neural network approach converges to the original problem. Numerical experiments support the theoretical findings.

Conclusion: The proposed auxiliary neural network framework provides a theoretically sound approach for solving infinite-dimensional total variation minimization problems, overcoming the solution existence issues of direct neural network approaches.

Abstract: Neural network approaches have been demonstrated to work quite well to solve
partial differential equations in practice. In this context approaches like
physics-informed neural networks and the Deep Ritz method have become popular.
In this paper, we propose a similar approach to solve an infinite-dimensional
total variation minimization problem using neural networks. We illustrate that
the resulting neural network problem does not have a solution in general. To
circumvent this theoretic issue, we consider an auxiliary neural network
problem, which indeed has a solution, and show that it converges in the sense
of $\Gamma$-convergence to the original problem. For computing a numerical
solution we further propose a discrete version of the auxiliary neural network
problem and again show its $\Gamma$-convergence to the original
infinite-dimensional problem. In particular, the $\Gamma$-convergence proof
suggests a particular discretization of the total variation. Moreover, we
connect the discrete neural network problem to a finite difference
discretization of the infinite-dimensional total variation minimization
problem. Numerical experiments are presented supporting our theoretical
findings.

### [138] [Generative Engine Optimization: How to Dominate AI Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08919)
*Mahe Chen,Xiaoxuan Wang,Kaiwen Chen,Nick Koudas*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: AI-powered search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) fundamentally differ from traditional search, showing strong bias towards authoritative third-party sources over brand-owned content, requiring new Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid adoption of generative AI search engines is reshaping information retrieval from ranked lists to synthesized answers, challenging traditional SEO practices and necessitating a new optimization paradigm.

Method: Conducted large-scale controlled experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases to quantify differences in information sourcing between AI search and traditional web search (Google).

Result: AI search exhibits systematic bias towards earned media (authoritative third-party sources) over brand-owned and social content, differs significantly in domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to phrasing compared to Google.

Conclusion: Proposes GEO strategic agenda with actionable guidance: engineer content for machine scannability, dominate earned media for AI authority, adopt engine-specific strategies, and overcome big brand bias for niche players in generative search landscape.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative AI-powered search engines like ChatGPT,
Perplexity, and Gemini is fundamentally reshaping information retrieval, moving
from traditional ranked lists to synthesized, citation-backed answers. This
shift challenges established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices and
necessitates a new paradigm, which we term Generative Engine Optimization
(GEO).
  This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of AI Search and
traditional web search (Google). Through a series of large-scale, controlled
experiments across multiple verticals, languages, and query paraphrases, we
quantify critical differences in how these systems source information. Our key
findings reveal that AI Search exhibit a systematic and overwhelming bias
towards Earned media (third-party, authoritative sources) over Brand-owned and
Social content, a stark contrast to Google's more balanced mix. We further
demonstrate that AI Search services differ significantly from each other in
their domain diversity, freshness, cross-language stability, and sensitivity to
phrasing.
  Based on these empirical results, we formulate a strategic GEO agenda. We
provide actionable guidance for practitioners, emphasizing the critical need
to: (1) engineer content for machine scannability and justification, (2)
dominate earned media to build AI-perceived authority, (3) adopt
engine-specific and language-aware strategies, and (4) overcome the inherent
"big brand bias" for niche players. Our work provides the foundational
empirical analysis and a strategic framework for achieving visibility in the
new generative search landscape.

*Zakaria El Kassimi,Fares Fourati,Mohamed-Slim Alouini*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: A telecom-specific RAG pipeline for radio regulation QA achieves 97% retrieval accuracy and 12% improvement over naive document insertion for GPT-4o, with a new domain-specific evaluation set.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question answering in radio regulations is legally sensitive and high-stakes, requiring accurate and reliable information retrieval and generation to ensure compliance and proper decision-making.

Method: Proposed a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with automated filtering and human validation to create the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, using domain-specific retrieval metrics.

Result: The retriever achieved approximately 97% accuracy under domain-specific metrics, and the pipeline improved generation accuracy across all tested models, with a nearly 12% relative improvement for GPT-4o compared to naive document insertion.

Conclusion: Carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering, with all code and evaluation scripts made publicly available.

Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally
sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge,
the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from
authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess
retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which
our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our
approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In
particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval
yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline
results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that
carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an
effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code
and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are
available at https://github.com/Zakaria010/Radio-RAG.

### [140] [A vibe coding learning design to enhance EFL students' talking to, through, and about AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08854)
*David James Woo,Kai Guo,Yangyang Yu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: Pilot study on vibe coding (AI-assisted natural language programming) for EFL education, showing that students' success depends on their prompt engineering skills, AI mental models, and authorship negotiation abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how AI-assisted natural language programming (vibe coding) can be used in English as a Foreign Language education and understand the factors that influence student success in this approach.

Method: Case study with two EFL students participating in a 4-hour workshop using backward design principles. Data collected from worksheets, video recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images. Developed a human-AI meta-languaging framework with three dimensions: talking to AI, talking through AI, and talking about AI.

Result: Contrasting outcomes: one student successfully created a functional application matching intended design, while another encountered technical difficulties with major design-functionality gaps. Differences in prompt engineering approaches revealed varying AI mental models and authorship attribution tensions.

Conclusion: Effective vibe coding instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, structured prompt engineering teaching, critical authorship discussions, and vocabulary development for articulating AI mental models. AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine in EFL education.

Abstract: This innovative practice article reports on the piloting of vibe coding
(using natural language to create software applications with AI) for English as
a Foreign Language (EFL) education. We developed a human-AI meta-languaging
framework with three dimensions: talking to AI (prompt engineering), talking
through AI (negotiating authorship), and talking about AI (mental models of
AI). Using backward design principles, we created a four-hour workshop where
two students designed applications addressing authentic EFL writing challenges.
We adopted a case study methodology, collecting data from worksheets and video
recordings, think-aloud protocols, screen recordings, and AI-generated images.
Contrasting cases showed one student successfully vibe coding a functional
application cohering to her intended design, while another encountered
technical difficulties with major gaps between intended design and actual
functionality. Analysis reveals differences in students' prompt engineering
approaches, suggesting different AI mental models and tensions in attributing
authorship. We argue that AI functions as a beneficial languaging machine, and
that differences in how students talk to, through, and about AI explain vibe
coding outcome variations. Findings indicate that effective vibe coding
instruction requires explicit meta-languaging scaffolding, teaching structured
prompt engineering, facilitating critical authorship discussions, and
developing vocabulary for articulating AI mental models.

### [141] [Dynamic Structural Recovery Parameters Enhance Prediction of Visual Outcomes After Macular Hole Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09227)
*Yinzheng Zhao,Zhihao Zhao,Rundong Jiang,Louisa Sackewitz,Quanmin Liang,Mathias Maier,Daniel Zapp,Peter Charbel Issa,Mohammad Ali Nasseri*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Novel dynamic structural parameters integrated with multimodal deep learning improve prediction of postoperative visual recovery in macular hole patients, outperforming traditional regression models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance prediction accuracy for postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole patients by incorporating dynamic structural parameters and multimodal deep learning approaches.

Method: Used longitudinal OCT dataset at five timepoints, developed stage-specific segmentation model, extracted quantitative/composite/qualitative/dynamic features, built binary logistic regression models with/without dynamic parameters, and created multimodal DL model combining clinical variables, OCT features, and raw images.

Result: Segmentation achieved high accuracy (mean Dice > 0.89). Dynamic recovery rates improved logistic regression AUC, especially at 3-month follow-up. Multimodal DL model outperformed regression with up to 0.12 higher AUC, demonstrating complementary value of raw images and dynamic parameters.

Conclusion: Integration of dynamic parameters into multimodal DL significantly enhances prediction accuracy, representing a promising automated clinical decision support tool for personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

Abstract: Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their
integration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting
postoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH)
patients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at
five stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage
specific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated
pipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.
Binary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic
parameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,
OCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against
regression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy
across all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses
identified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as
significant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates
consistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month
follow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding
higher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as
0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic
parameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL
model significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated
process therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for
personalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.

### [142] [Virtual staining for 3D X-ray histology of bone implants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09235)
*Sarah C. Irvine,Christian Lucas,Diana Krüger,Bianca Guedert,Julian Moosmann,Berit Zeller-Plumhoff*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging by using deep learning to generate artificially stained histological images from micro-CT scans, enabling label-free 3D tissue characterization without physical sectioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray tomography provides non-invasive 3D imaging but lacks biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. The researchers aimed to extend virtual staining techniques from optical to X-ray domain to enhance interpretability of 3D tissue imaging without additional sample preparation.

Method: Used over 50 co-registered micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology image pairs from bone-implant samples. Trained a modified CycleGAN network with pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, incorporating data augmentation for patch-based training. The model was tailored for limited paired data scenarios.

Result: The modified CycleGAN outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. The model successfully produced histologically realistic color outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail, enabling generation of virtually stained 3D datasets from full CT volumes.

Conclusion: This work successfully introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging, providing a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterization. While features like new bone formation were reproduced, some variability in implant degradation depiction indicates need for more training data and refinement.

Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative
to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues
without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the
inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical
specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital
pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in
simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,
we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image
translation to generate artificially stained slices from
synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image
pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant
samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired
data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of
the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The
model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,
producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving
high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard
CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the
model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D
datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.
While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some
variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need
for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining
to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,
label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.

### [143] [In-Loop Filtering Using Learned Look-Up Tables for Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09494)
*Zhuoyuan Li,Jiacheng Li,Yao Li,Jialin Li,Li Li,Dong Liu,Feng Wu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A practical in-loop filtering solution using look-up tables (LUTs) instead of heavy DNN computations, achieving significant bitrate reduction with lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural network-based ILF schemes provide excellent coding gains but have high computational complexity and hardware demands, making them impractical for general use.

Method: Train a DNN with restricted reference range, cache all outputs into LUTs, use indexing mechanisms for filtering reference perception, cross-component filtering, and LUT compaction for storage efficiency.

Result: Achieves 0.82%/2.97%/1.63% and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction under AI and RA configurations respectively, with much lower time complexity and storage cost than DNN solutions.

Conclusion: LUT-ILF++ provides a practical, efficient alternative to DNN-based in-loop filtering with significant coding gains and reduced computational demands.

Abstract: In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to
reduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF
schemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate
for next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural
networks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high
demands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To
address this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up
tables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,
all possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached
into LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by
simply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and
interpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference
computations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,
termed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of
filtering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable
better filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,
we propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of
different color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution
practical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the
LUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The
proposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental
results show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%
and 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI
and RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our
proposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.
