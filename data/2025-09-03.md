### [1] [MultiStream-LLM: Bridging Modalities for Robust Sign Language Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00030)
*Marshall Thomas,Edward Fish,Richard Bowden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MultiStream-LLM introduces a modular framework for sign language translation that uses separate specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading, achieving state-of-the-art results by solving recognition tasks individually before fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monolithic end-to-end SLT models fail to handle high-speed fingerspelling and asynchronous non-manual facial cues effectively, leading to poor performance on crucial information like names, places, and technical terms.

Method: Employ separate expert networks for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and lipreading that decode each modality into tokens. These parallel streams are fused by a lightweight transformer to resolve temporal misalignments, then passed to an LLM for final sentence generation.

Result: Achieves new SOTA on How2Sign benchmark with BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and 73.2% letter accuracy on ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset.

Conclusion: Isolating and solving distinct recognition tasks before fusion provides a more powerful and effective pathway to robust, high-fidelity sign language translation compared to monolithic approaches.

Abstract: Despite progress in gloss-free Sign Language Translation (SLT), monolithic
end-to-end models consistently fail on two critical components of natural
signing: the precise recognition of high-speed fingerspelling and the
integration of asynchronous non-manual cues from the face. Recent progress in
Automated Sign Language Translation with Large Language Models has side stepped
this challenge, forcing a single network to learn these simultaneously
resulting in poor performance when tasked with translating crucial information
such as names,places, and technical terms. We introduce MultiStream-LLM, a
modular framework designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach employs
separate, specialized predictors for continuous signing, fingerspelling, and
lipreading. Each expert network first decodes its specific modality into a
sequence of tokens. These parallel streams are then fused by a lightweight
transformer that resolves temporal misalignments before passing the combined
representation to a Large Language Model (LLM) for final sentence generation.
Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on the How2Sign benchmark with a
BLEU-4 score of 23.5 and achieves 73.2% letter accuracy on the challenging
ChicagoFSWildPlus fingerspelling dataset. These results validate our core
hypothesis: by isolating and solving distinct recogni tion tasks before fusion,
our multi-expert approach provides a more powerful and effective pathway to
robust, high-fidelity sign language translation.

### [2] [Compiling Prompts, Not Crafting Them: A Reproducible Workflow for AI-Assisted Evidence Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00038)
*Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a declarative prompt optimization framework for improving reliability and reproducibility of LLM-assisted systematic literature reviews, addressing current fragility in manual prompt crafting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for systematic literature reviews rely on brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and reproducibility, undermining scientific confidence in evidence synthesis.

Method: Adapts recent advances in declarative prompt optimization to SLR automation, proposing a structured domain-specific framework with task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning integrated into reproducible workflows.

Result: Provides a concrete blueprint with working code examples that enables researchers to construct verifiable LLM pipelines aligned with transparency and rigor principles in evidence synthesis.

Conclusion: This represents a novel application of declarative prompt optimization methods to systematic literature review pipelines, enhancing reliability and scientific confidence in LLM-assisted evidence synthesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate
systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on
brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and
reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in
LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances
in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM
applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR
automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that
embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a
reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a
concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to
construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of
transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of
such approaches to SLR pipelines.

### [3] [What Are Research Hypotheses?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00185)
*Jian Wu,Sarah Rajtmajer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper reviews and clarifies various definitions of 'hypothesis' in natural language processing tasks, highlighting definitional inconsistencies across literature and emphasizing the importance of well-structured hypotheses for machine-interpretable scholarly records.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is significant inconsistency in how the term 'hypothesis' is defined across natural language understanding tasks and literature, with definitions diverging from traditional scientific meanings. This creates challenges for automated hypothesis processing and scholarly record interpretation.

Method: The authors overview and delineate various definitions of hypotheses, particularly examining definition nuances across recently published NLU tasks and comparing them with traditional definitions from natural, social, and formal sciences.

Result: The analysis reveals substantial differences in hypothesis definitions across NLU literature, showing how interpretations have migrated from traditional scientific definitions and vary even within the NLU field itself.

Conclusion: Well-structured and clearly defined hypotheses are critically important, especially as the field moves toward creating machine-interpretable scholarly records, requiring more consistent and rigorous definitions of hypotheses in NLP research.

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing,
significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically
extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific
domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various
natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional
definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we
observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we
overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we
discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We
highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses,
particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

### [4] [Explainable Chain-of-Thought Reasoning: An Empirical Analysis on State-Aware Reasoning Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00190)
*Sheldon Yu,Yuxin Xiong,Junda Wu,Xintong Li,Tong Yu,Xiang Chen,Ritwik Sinha,Jingbo Shang,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A state-aware transition framework that abstracts chain-of-thought reasoning into structured latent dynamics using spectral analysis and Markov chains for better explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chain-of-thought prompting lacks explainability, with prior work focusing only on local token-level attribution while ignoring high-level semantic roles and transitions between reasoning steps.

Method: Represent each reasoning step via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings, cluster them into semantically coherent latent states, and model their progression as a Markov chain to capture the global structure of reasoning.

Result: The framework provides a structured and interpretable view of reasoning processes, enabling semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed state-aware transition framework offers enhanced explainability for chain-of-thought reasoning by capturing both semantic evolution and global reasoning structure through latent state modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large
language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the
explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily
focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic
roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT
trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the
evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via
spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically
coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we
model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and
interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range
of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern
visualization, and consistency evaluation.

### [5] [The Rarity Blind Spot: A Framework for Evaluating Statistical Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00245)
*Seiji Maekawa,Hayate Iso,Nikita Bhutani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task requiring LLMs to identify globally rare features across document collections, and presents DiFBench for systematic evaluation, revealing significant performance gaps and limitations in statistical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM benchmarks focus on retrieval and summarization but don't evaluate the ability to identify globally distinctive features across document sets, which is crucial for real-world decision-making scenarios like candidate selection and product differentiation.

Method: The authors introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM) task and develop DiFBench, a configurable benchmark framework with controllable parameters (document set size, distinctiveness thresholds) to systematically evaluate LLMs' ability to identify rare features across 10-40 documents.

Result: Large-scale evaluation across 10 state-of-the-art LLMs shows significant performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models degrade substantially with increased task complexity and document count, with common failure being misidentification of frequent features as distinctive.

Conclusion: Contemporary LLMs have core limitations in fine-grained statistical reasoning and rarity detection capabilities, particularly as task complexity increases, highlighting the need for improved reasoning abilities in identifying globally distinctive features.

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each
candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving
or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a
model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of
documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that
challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and
surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less
than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as
candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning,
not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we
present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable
parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using
DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining
across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance
gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however,
substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We
also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as
distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs'
abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

### [6] [The Differential Meaning of Models: A Framework for Analyzing the Structural Consequences of Semantic Modeling Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00248)
*Zachary K. Stine,James E. Deitrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a Peircean semiotic framework for comparing human meaning-making models by treating models as signs that measure latent symbol geometries, enabling relational analysis across different model types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing modeling practices across various human meaning-making models in a consistent, comparable way.

Method: Develops a framework grounded in C.S. Peirce's semiotic theory, arguing that models measure latent symbol geometries and should be understood relationally through contrast with other models.

Result: Creates a theory of model semantics where models and modeling decisions are treated as signs themselves, enabling apples-to-apples comparison across different modeling approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a unified way to analyze and compare diverse modeling practices in semiotic systems, with potential applications illustrated through examples and future research directions.

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes
a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems.
However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these
modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In
this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C.
S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which
can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies
underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a
model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of
performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the
particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast
with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which
models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated
as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical
use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future
directions enabled by the framework.

### [7] [The Temporal Game: A New Perspective on Temporal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00250)
*Hugo Sousa,Ricardo Campos,Alípio Jorge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Temporal Game is a novel approach for temporal relation extraction that treats annotation as an interactive game, decomposing interval relations into point-wise comparisons and using temporal closure for consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more flexible and fine-grained temporal annotation approach that supports both interval and instant entities, while laying groundwork for reinforcement learning agents by framing annotation as sequential decision-making.

Method: Decomposes interval-level relations into point-wise comparisons between start/end points of temporal entities. Players classify single point relations at each step, and the system applies temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency.

Result: Developed a demo with Game mode (annotating TempEval-3 texts with scoring feedback) and Annotation mode (custom document annotation with timeline export). The system is publicly available and open-sourced.

Conclusion: The Temporal Game serves as both a research tool and annotation interface, providing a novel game-based approach to temporal relation extraction that enables more flexible annotation and supports future reinforcement learning applications in temporal reasoning.

Abstract: In this paper we demo the Temporal Game, a novel approach to temporal
relation extraction that casts the task as an interactive game. Instead of
directly annotating interval-level relations, our approach decomposes them into
point-wise comparisons between the start and end points of temporal entities.
At each step, players classify a single point relation, and the system applies
temporal closure to infer additional relations and enforce consistency. This
point-based strategy naturally supports both interval and instant entities,
enabling more fine-grained and flexible annotation than any previous approach.
The Temporal Game also lays the groundwork for training reinforcement learning
agents, by treating temporal annotation as a sequential decision-making task.
To showcase this potential, the demo presented in this paper includes a Game
mode, in which users annotate texts from the TempEval-3 dataset and receive
feedback based on a scoring system, and an Annotation mode, that allows custom
documents to be annotated and resulting timeline to be exported. Therefore,
this demo serves both as a research tool and an annotation interface. The demo
is publicly available at https://temporal-game.inesctec.pt, and the source code
is open-sourced to foster further research and community-driven development in
temporal reasoning and annotation.

### [8] [Exploring Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding with Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00276)
*Yuxiang Liu,Tian Wang,Gourab Kundu,Tianyu Cao,Guang Cheng,Zhen Ge,Jianshu Chen,Qingjun Cui,Trishul Chilimbi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RITE enhances text embeddings by integrating logical reasoning through generative LLMs, improving retrieval performance on complex queries requiring inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder-only retrievers struggle with complex queries requiring reasoning beyond surface-level matching, while LLMs' reasoning capabilities are underutilized in existing embedding methods.

Method: RITE generates intermediate reasoning texts in token space before computing embeddings, enriching representations with inferential depth using generative LLMs.

Result: Significant improvement in zero-shot retrieval performance on BRIGHT benchmark across diverse domains.

Conclusion: Incorporating reasoning into the embedding process through generative LLMs effectively enhances retrieval performance for complex queries.

Abstract: Transformer-based models such as BERT and E5 have significantly advanced text
embedding by capturing rich contextual representations. However, many complex
real-world queries require sophisticated reasoning to retrieve relevant
documents beyond surface-level lexical matching, where encoder-only retrievers
often fall short. Decoder-only large language models (LLMs), known for their
strong reasoning capabilities, offer a promising alternative. Despite this
potential, existing LLM-based embedding methods primarily focus on contextual
representation and do not fully exploit the reasoning strength of LLMs. To
bridge this gap, we propose Reasoning-Infused Text Embedding (RITE), a simple
but effective approach that integrates logical reasoning into the text
embedding process using generative LLMs. RITE builds upon existing language
model embedding techniques by generating intermediate reasoning texts in the
token space before computing embeddings, thereby enriching representations with
inferential depth. Experimental results on BRIGHT, a reasoning-intensive
retrieval benchmark, demonstrate that RITE significantly enhances zero-shot
retrieval performance across diverse domains, underscoring the effectiveness of
incorporating reasoning into the embedding process.

*Mir Tafseer Nayeem,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpinioRAG is a scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval with LLMs to generate personalized opinion summaries from thousands of user reviews, with novel verification metrics for sentiment-rich domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to scale or produce generic summaries that overlook personalized needs when dealing with large volumes of user reviews (thousands per entity).

Method: Introduces OpinioRAG framework combining RAG-based evidence retrieval with LLMs, plus novel reference-free verification metrics for sentiment-rich domains to assess factual consistency.

Result: Created first large-scale dataset of long-form user reviews with expert summaries and annotated queries. Extensive experiments show OpinioRAG generates accurate, relevant, and structured summaries at scale.

Conclusion: OpinioRAG provides a robust framework for scalable opinion summary generation, identifies key challenges, offers actionable insights, and paves the way for future research in personalized review summarization.

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of
user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods
either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that
overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a
scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval
with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose
novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains,
where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These
metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual
consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale
dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand
reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated
queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide
actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research,
and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant,
and structured summaries at scale.

### [10] [Wage Sentiment Indices Derived from Survey Comments via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00290)
*Taihei Sone*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Wage Sentiment Index (WSI) using Large Language Models to forecast wage dynamics in Japan, outperforming traditional methods and showing potential for economic policy enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The emergence of generative AI creates new opportunities for economic text analysis, particularly for forecasting wage dynamics which is crucial for economic policy design by governments and central banks.

Method: Develops a Wage Sentiment Index (WSI) using Large Language Models based on Japan's Economy Watchers Survey data, extending the Price Sentiment Index framework. Also creates a scalable data architecture for integrating additional sources like newspapers and social media.

Result: Experimental results show that WSI models based on LLMs significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models in forecasting wage dynamics.

Conclusion: LLM-driven sentiment indices have strong potential to enhance the timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design, demonstrating the value of generative AI in economic text analysis.

Abstract: The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has created new
opportunities for economic text analysis. This study proposes a Wage Sentiment
Index (WSI) constructed with Large Language Models (LLMs) to forecast wage
dynamics in Japan. The analysis is based on the Economy Watchers Survey (EWS),
a monthly survey conducted by the Cabinet Office of Japan that captures
real-time economic assessments from workers in industries highly sensitive to
business conditions. The WSI extends the framework of the Price Sentiment Index
(PSI) used in prior studies, adapting it specifically to wage related
sentiment. To ensure scalability and adaptability, a data architecture is also
developed that enables integration of additional sources such as newspapers and
social media. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI models based on LLMs
significantly outperform both baseline approaches and pretrained models. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven sentiment indices to enhance the
timeliness and effectiveness of economic policy design by governments and
central banks.

### [11] [Balanced Actor Initialization: Stable RLHF Training of Distillation-Based Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00309)
*Chen Zheng,Yiyuan Ma,Yuan Yang,Deyi Liu,Jing Liu,Zuquan Song,Yuxin Song,Cheng Ren,Hang Zhu,Xin Liu,Yiyuan Ma,Siyuan Qiao,Xun Zhou,Liang Xiang,Yonghui Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BAI method solves RLHF instability issues in distillation-trained models through weighted model merging, preventing sequence collapse and reward drops while preserving reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the instability challenges when applying RLHF to distillation-trained models, which suffer from Sequence Length Collapse and Reward Hockey Stick Curve problems that compromise alignment and reasoning.

Method: Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI) - a two-stage weighted model merging approach that combines instruction-following models, distillation-based reasoning models, and pretrained models to preserve foundational knowledge.

Result: BAI resolves Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates Reward Hockey Stick Curve, enables continuous sequence length improvement, and achieves optimal trade-offs between training stability and reasoning capability preservation.

Conclusion: BAI provides an effective solution for stable training in the third paradigm, enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency with RLHF alignment.

Abstract: The development of alignment and reasoning capabilities in large language
models has seen remarkable progress through two paradigms: instruction tuning
and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) alignment paradigm, and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuning paradigm. While both approaches prove
effective independently, the third paradigm of applying RLHF to
distillation-trained models presents significant challenges. Our investigation
reveals two critical phenomena that emerge in this paradigm: Sequence Length
Collapse, where language generation dramatically reduces during early RLHF
training, and the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, featuring severe reward score
drops followed by gradual recovery. These instabilities fundamentally
compromise the model's alignment and reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Balanced Actor Initialization (BAI), a two-stage
weighted model merging approach. BAI first merges instruction-following and
distillation-based reasoning fine-tuned models, then further combines this
intermediate model with the pretrained model to preserve foundational
knowledge. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and
detailed analysis of training experiments, we demonstrate that BAI resolves
Sequence Length Collapse, mitigates the Reward Hockey Stick Curve, and enables
continuous sequence length improvement during training. Additionally, our
analysis reveals that balanced merging ratios achieve optimal trade-offs
between training stability and reasoning capability preservation. Our work
provides the effective solution for stable training in this third paradigm,
enabling more capable reasoning models that combine distillation efficiency
with RLHF alignment.

### [12] [GIER: Gap-Driven Self-Refinement for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00325)
*Rinku Dewri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GIER is a framework that improves LLM outputs through self-reflection using natural language gap descriptions, enhancing reasoning quality without accuracy degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompting strategies rely on demonstrations or templates, but there's a need for methods that use conceptual quality criteria for iterative self-improvement.

Method: GIER uses natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps to prompt models to iteratively critique and refine their own outputs to meet quality criteria.

Result: Across three reasoning tasks and four LLMs, GIER improved rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning alignment without reducing task accuracy.

Conclusion: Models can effectively interpret abstract conceptual gaps and translate them into concrete reasoning improvements through iterative self-reflection.

Abstract: We introduce GIER (Gap-driven Iterative Enhancement of Responses), a general
framework for improving large language model (LLM) outputs through
self-reflection and revision based on conceptual quality criteria. Unlike
prompting strategies that rely on demonstrations, examples, or chain-of-thought
templates, GIER utilizes natural language descriptions of reasoning gaps, and
prompts a model to iteratively critique and refine its own outputs to better
satisfy these criteria. Across three reasoning-intensive tasks (SciFact,
PrivacyQA, and e-SNLI) and four LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and
Llama 3.3 70B), GIER improves rationale quality, grounding, and reasoning
alignment without degrading task accuracy. Our analysis demonstrates that
models can not only interpret abstract conceptual gaps but also translate them
into concrete reasoning improvements.

### [13] [Open Data Synthesis For Deep Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00375)
*Ziyi Xia,Kun Luo,Hongjin Qian,Zheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InfoSeek is a framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks using hierarchical constraint satisfaction problems, enabling better training of LLMs for multi-step reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks fail to capture the complexity of deep research tasks that require hierarchical reasoning and evidence synthesis from diverse sources, while synthetic datasets often have shortcuts or knowledge leakage issues.

Method: Uses a dual-agent system to recursively build Research Trees from webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions requiring full hierarchy traversal. Enables scaling to 50K+ training examples with reasoning trajectories via reject sampling.

Result: Models trained on InfoSeek outperform strong baselines. 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs, achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs on BrowseComp-Plus benchmark.

Conclusion: InfoSeek provides a scalable framework for generating complex deep research tasks that significantly improves LLM performance on hierarchical reasoning problems while supporting advanced optimization strategies through preserved meta-information.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple
factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions
into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence
from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers
as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are
fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP
formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA)
fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often
introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural
depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for
synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to
recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring
intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into
natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also
enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set,
and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that
models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a
challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass
much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash),
while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro).
By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels,
InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound
reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and
datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

### [14] [GraphKV: Breaking the Static Selection Paradigm with Graph-Based KV Cache Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00388)
*Xuelin Li,Xiangqi Jin,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GraphKV is a graph-based framework for dynamic KV cache management that uses decay-signal-propagation to adaptively retain contextually important tokens, improving memory efficiency in long-sequence LLM processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional KV cache eviction strategies rely on static heuristics that cannot capture evolving token dependencies during inference, leading to suboptimal memory management in long text sequences.

Method: Models tokens as graph nodes with importance scores and edges representing similarity relationships. Uses decay-signal-propagation mechanism to dynamically update token importance by propagating information across the graph.

Result: Provides adaptive retention of contextually significant tokens and can be seamlessly integrated with existing KV cache eviction methods like SnapKV and PyramidKV in a plug-and-play manner.

Conclusion: GraphKV offers an effective graph-based solution for dynamic KV cache compression that addresses the limitations of static heuristics, enabling better memory efficiency while maintaining contextual relevance in long-sequence processing.

Abstract: Efficient Key-Value (KV) cache management is essential for processing long
text sequences in large language models (LLMs), where memory constraints often
limit performance. Conventional KV eviction strategies, such as top-k selection
based on attention scores, depend on static heuristics that fail to capture the
evolving implicit dependencies among tokens during inference. To overcome this,
we propose GraphKV, a graph-based framework that redefines token selection for
KV cache compression. In GraphKV, tokens are modeled as nodes with importance
scores, and edges represent their similarity relationships. Through a
decay-signal-propagation mechanism, token importance is dynamically updated by
propagating information across the graph, enabling adaptive retention of the
most contextually significant tokens. GraphKV can be seamlessly utilized in
existing KV cache eviction methods such as SnapKV and PyramidKV in a
plug-and-play manner. Codes will be released on Github.

### [15] [The Resurgence of GCG Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00391)
*Yuting Tan,Xuying Li,Zhuo Li,Huizhen Shu,Peikang Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of GCG and T-GCG adversarial attacks shows attack success decreases with model size, prefix heuristics overestimate effectiveness, and coding prompts are more vulnerable than safety prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a comprehensive assessment of gradient-based adversarial prompting methods (GCG and T-GCG) across different LLM scales and evaluate their effectiveness on both safety and reasoning tasks.

Method: Evaluated GCG and its annealing-augmented variant T-GCG on Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B models using AdvBench safety prompts and reasoning-intensive coding prompts, comparing prefix-based heuristics with GPT-4o semantic judgments.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Attack success rates decrease with model size due to complex loss landscapes; (2) Prefix heuristics substantially overestimate effectiveness compared to semantic judgments; (3) Coding prompts are significantly more vulnerable than safety prompts. T-GCG showed competitive performance under prefix evaluation but limited benefits under semantic judgment.

Conclusion: The study reveals scalability limits of GCG, exposes vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivates further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient
(GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large
language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG
and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying
scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack
effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and
reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1)
attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing
complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2)
prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness
compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more
realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more
vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself
can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with
T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and
achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under
semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the
scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning
tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for
more robust adversarial evaluation.

*Juraj Vladika,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedSEBA is an AI-powered system that synthesizes evidence-based medical answers by grounding LLM responses in PubMed studies, providing traceable arguments and research consensus visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of distinguishing reliable medical information online and keeping track of evolving medical research findings with conflicting conclusions.

Method: Uses Large Language Models to generate coherent answers dynamically grounded in trustworthy medical studies retrieved from PubMed database, with traceable arguments and research consensus visualization.

Result: User study showed medical experts and lay users find the system usable, helpful, trustworthy and informative for both everyday health questions and advanced research.

Conclusion: MedSEBA is well-suited for synthesizing evidence-based medical information from research studies, making complex medical knowledge more accessible and trustworthy.

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical
advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it
has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading
information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year,
making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific
findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not
reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we
introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing
evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large
Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them
in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database
PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced
back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of
the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given
medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved
through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find
the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and
informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health
questions and advanced research insights.

*Fenghua Liu,Yulong Chen,Yixuan Liu,Zhujun Jin,Solomon Tsai,Ming Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camlang is a constructed language test that reveals LLMs struggle with genuine metalinguistic reasoning, performing far below humans despite excelling on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether LLMs' benchmark success reflects genuine reasoning or just pattern matching, using cognitive science principles of metalinguistic deductive learning.

Method: Created Camlang - a novel constructed language with naturalistic but unattested features, plus grammar book and bilingual dictionary. Adapted CommonsenseQA into Camlang-CSQA-v0 to evaluate grammatical rule application and lexical mapping.

Result: GPT-5 achieved 98% EM in English but only 47% in Camlang, far below human performance (87%). Most model successes came from shallow lexical alignment rather than systematic grammatical mastery.

Conclusion: Camlang exposes fundamental gaps between current LLMs and human metalinguistic competence, showing models lack genuine reasoning abilities despite benchmark success.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve gold-medal performance across many
benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects genuine
reasoning or pattern matching. From a cognitive science perspective, an
informative test is whether models can master an unfamiliar language through
explicit metalinguistic deductive learning, a paradigm where human learners can
reliably internalise grammatical systems through metalinguistic reasoning. We
address this question with Camlang, a novel constructed language that exhibits
naturalistic yet unattested feature combinations. Camlang consists of two
explicit resources, a grammar book and a bilingual dictionary, which mirror
adult second-language learning via explicit grammar rules and lexical lookup,
and enable us to disentangle errors in morpho-syntax, lexical semantics, and
sentence-level reasoning. Human experiments show that these resources are
sufficient for participants to acquire Camlang and successfully solve Camlang
tasks. To operationalise evaluation, we adapt CommonsenseQA into Camlang,
creating Camlang-CSQA-v0, the first task in a broader suite where solving
questions requires applying grammar rules and lexical mappings. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 achieves 98\% EM accuracy in English but only 47\% in
Camlang, far below human performance at 87\%, while other state-of-the-art
reasoning LLMs perform even worse. Human verification further reveals that most
model successes stem from shallow lexical alignment while GPT-5 shows emerging
metalinguistic awareness to a limited extent but not systematic grammatical
mastery as humans. Camlang establishes a cognitively grounded evaluation
paradigm that exposes fundamental gaps between current models and human
metalinguistic competence.

### [18] [GOSU: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Global-Level Optimized Semantic Unit-Centric Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00449)
*Xuecheng Zou,Ke Liu,Bingbing Wang,Huafei Deng,Li Zhang,Yu Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GOSU is a semantic unit-centric RAG framework that addresses ambiguity and retrieval overhead in graph-based RAG by performing global disambiguation and leveraging semantic units to capture global interconnections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard graph-based RAG with heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs faces issues with ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to limited local text chunk extraction and lack of global knowledge.

Method: GOSU performs global merging on pre-extracted semantic units, guides entity/relationship extraction, uses hierarchical keyword extraction, and semantic unit completion to capture both fine-grained binary relationships and coarse-grained n-ary relationships.

Result: Evaluation across multiple tasks shows that GOSU outperforms baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

Conclusion: GOSU effectively addresses the limitations of traditional graph-based RAG by leveraging global semantic unit processing and hierarchical relationship capture, resulting in improved retrieval and generation performance.

Abstract: Building upon the standard graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
the introduction of heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs aims to enrich
retrieval and generation by leveraging the relationships between multiple
entities through the concept of semantic units (SUs). But this also raises a
key issue: The extraction of high-level SUs limited to local text chunks is
prone to ambiguity, complex coupling, and increased retrieval overhead due to
the lack of global knowledge or the neglect of fine-grained relationships. To
address these issues, we propose GOSU, a semantic unit-centric RAG framework
that efficiently performs global disambiguation and utilizes SUs to capture
interconnections between different nodes across the global context. In the
graph construction phase, GOSU performs global merging on the pre-extracted SUs
from local text chunks and guides entity and relationship extraction, reducing
the difficulty of coreference resolution while uncovering global semantic
objects across text chunks. In the retrieval and generation phase, we introduce
hierarchical keyword extraction and semantic unit completion. The former
uncovers the fine-grained binary relationships overlooked by the latter, while
the latter compensates for the coarse-grained n-ary relationships missing from
the former. Evaluation across multiple tasks demonstrates that GOSU outperforms
the baseline RAG methods in terms of generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lightweight framework for Islamic inheritance multiple-choice questions using Arabic text encoders and Attentive Relevance Scoring, achieving 69.87% accuracy with on-device deployability vs. 87.6% from large LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Islamic inheritance law requires precise heir identification and share calculation, posing challenges for AI systems that need to balance accuracy with practical deployment constraints.

Method: Specialized Arabic text encoder (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) with Attentive Relevance Scoring (ARS) to rank answer options by semantic relevance, enabling fast on-device inference without generative reasoning.

Result: MARBERT-based approach achieved 69.87% accuracy on QIAS 2025 dataset, compared to up to 87.6% from API-based LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek), demonstrating trade-off between performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Specialized smaller systems offer compelling advantages in efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy despite lower peak performance, making them suitable for high-stakes domains like Islamic inheritance law.

Abstract: Islamic inheritance law (Ilm al-Mawarith) requires precise identification of
heirs and calculation of shares, which poses a challenge for AI. In this paper,
we present a lightweight framework for solving multiple-choice inheritance
questions using a specialised Arabic text encoder and Attentive Relevance
Scoring (ARS). The system ranks answer options according to semantic relevance,
and enables fast, on-device inference without generative reasoning. We evaluate
Arabic encoders (MARBERT, ArabicBERT, AraBERT) and compare them with API-based
LLMs (Gemini, DeepSeek) on the QIAS 2025 dataset. While large models achieve an
accuracy of up to 87.6%, they require more resources and are context-dependent.
Our MARBERT-based approach achieves 69.87% accuracy, presenting a compelling
case for efficiency, on-device deployability, and privacy. While this is lower
than the 87.6% achieved by the best-performing LLM, our work quantifies a
critical trade-off between the peak performance of large models and the
practical advantages of smaller, specialized systems in high-stakes domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TECP is a novel framework that uses token-level entropy as an uncertainty measure in conformal prediction to provide formal coverage guarantees for black-box language generation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification for open-ended language generation remains challenging, especially under black-box constraints where internal model signals are inaccessible.

Method: Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP) leverages token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and integrates it into a split conformal prediction pipeline to construct prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods.

Conclusion: TECP provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings by directly estimating epistemic uncertainty from token entropy structure and calibrating uncertainty thresholds via conformal prediction quantiles.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints
where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce
Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages
token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and
integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct
prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches
that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP
directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of
sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to
ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language
models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP
consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets,
outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a
principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM
settings.

*Saksorn Ruangtanusak,Pittawat Taveekitworachai,Kunat Pipatanakul*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rule-based role prompting with character-card/scene-contract design and strict function calling enforcement achieved best performance (0.571 score) in addressing over-speaking and under-acting issues in persona-grounded dialogue agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dialogue agents in persona-grounded settings often produce overly long responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to persona (under-acting), such as generating non-existent function calls or making unnecessary tool calls.

Method: Explored four prompting approaches: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting (RRP) with character-card/scene-contract design and strict function calling enforcement.

Result: Rule-based role prompting (RRP) achieved the best performance with overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519, outperforming more elaborate methods like APO.

Conclusion: RRP design substantially improves effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents. All best-performing prompts and APO tool are open-sourced to support future persona prompt development efforts.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large
language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track
of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this
setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses
(over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona
(under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making
unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches
to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role
prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role
prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best
performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design
and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of
0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings
demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and
reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate
methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts,
we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool.

*Li S. Yifei,Allen Chang,Chaitanya Malaviya,Mark Yatskar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ResearchQA is a new evaluation resource that converts survey articles from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items to assess LLM systems' ability to provide comprehensive research-quality answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of long-form research responses relies heavily on expert annotators, limiting evaluation to fields like AI where researchers can easily find colleagues. Research expertise is widespread across many fields through survey articles that synthesize distributed knowledge.

Method: The authors distilled survey articles from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric, derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific evaluation criteria including citing papers, making explanations, and describing limitations. They used 31 Ph.D. annotators across 8 fields for validation.

Result: 96% of queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items require sentence-level addressing in responses. The automatic pairwise judge achieved 74% agreement with expert judgments. Evaluation of 18 systems showed no parametric or retrieval-augmented system exceeded 70% rubric coverage, with the best agentic system at 75%. The highest system fully addressed less than 11% of citation items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items.

Conclusion: ResearchQA enables comprehensive multi-field evaluation of LLM systems, revealing significant competency gaps in research-quality responses, particularly in citation handling, limitation description, and comparison tasks. The resource is released to facilitate broader evaluation across diverse research domains.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert
annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can
conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey
articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce
ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles
from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric,
derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer
evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing
limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of
queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be
addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are
able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with
expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18
systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented
system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the
highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that
the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric
items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our
data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

*Jialong Zuo,Guangyan Zhang,Minghui Fang,Shengpeng Ji,Xiaoqi Jiao,Jingyu Li,Yiwen Guo,Zhou Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework to compress speech representations from 25-50 tokens/sec to more efficient semantic-level tokens, achieving comparable or better performance on downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech representation methods produce redundant fine-grained tokens (25-50 tokens/sec) that capture phonetic-level details rather than semantic information, hindering efficiency in training and inference.

Method: Pre-train speech language model via next-token prediction, use predictive entropy to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, and employ cross-attention to fuse information within segments. Granularity is controlled by entropy threshold.

Result: Compressed representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences on ASR, speech-to-text translation, and voice conversion tasks.

Conclusion: The entropy-based dynamic aggregation framework effectively learns compressed semantic speech representations while maintaining or improving performance, offering flexible control over granularity and compression ratio.

Abstract: Discrete speech representation learning has recently attracted increasing
interest in both acoustic and semantic modeling. Existing approaches typically
encode 16 kHz waveforms into discrete tokens at a rate of 25 or 50 tokens per
second. However, given that speech generally conveys only 2 to 5 words per
second, such fine-grained tokenization introduces redundancy and hinders
efficiency in downstream training and inference. Moreover, semantic speech
representations at this frequency primarily capture phonetic-level information,
while semantic understanding may not require such detailed token-level
resolution. To address these limitations, we propose an entropy-based dynamic
aggregation framework for learning compressed semantic speech representations.
A speech language model is first pre-trained via next-token prediction on
large-scale unlabeled data to capture frequent token patterns. Predictive
entropy is then used to adaptively determine aggregation boundaries, followed
by a cross-attention module that fuses information within each segment. By
adjusting the entropy threshold, the granularity and compression ratio of the
representations can be flexibly controlled. Experiments on ASR, speech-to-text
translation, and voice conversion tasks demonstrate that the compressed
representations perform on par with or better than dense token sequences,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Eunjung Cho,Alexander Hoyle,Yoan Hermstrüwer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show role-biased summarization in legal contexts, selectively framing information to align with different legal stakeholders' perspectives even when instructed to be balanced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how LLMs exhibit motivated reasoning by adapting legal summaries to align with different legal roles (judges, prosecutors, attorneys) despite balancing instructions.

Method: Developed an evaluation framework based on legal fact and reasoning inclusion, plus favorability metrics, to analyze LLM summaries conditioned on different legal roles from judicial decisions.

Result: Models consistently showed selective inclusion patterns that reflected role-consistent perspectives, demonstrating alignment with stakeholder positions even with balancing instructions.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit concerning role-based alignment in legal summarization, highlighting the need for role-aware evaluation in high-stakes legal applications as models may infer user roles from context.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate user-tailored
summaries, adapting outputs to specific stakeholders. In legal contexts, this
raises important questions about motivated reasoning -- how models
strategically frame information to align with a stakeholder's position within
the legal system. Building on theories of legal realism and recent trends in
legal practice, we investigate how LLMs respond to prompts conditioned on
different legal roles (e.g., judges, prosecutors, attorneys) when summarizing
judicial decisions. We introduce an evaluation framework grounded in legal fact
and reasoning inclusion, also considering favorability towards stakeholders.
Our results show that even when prompts include balancing instructions, models
exhibit selective inclusion patterns that reflect role-consistent perspectives.
These findings raise broader concerns about how similar alignment may emerge as
LLMs begin to infer user roles from prior interactions or context, even without
explicit role instructions. Our results underscore the need for role-aware
evaluation of LLM summarization behavior in high-stakes legal settings.

*Hanqi Yan,Hainiu Xu,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs become more vulnerable to malicious requests when reasoning capabilities are enhanced through think-mode or math fine-tuning, with dense models being particularly affected. Attention shifts and expert specialization help redirect reasoning towards safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more widely adopted, concerns about their safety and alignment with human values have increased. Previous research showed fine-tuning on malicious data causes misalignment, but this paper investigates a more concerning phenomenon where enhanced reasoning itself induces misalignment.

Method: The study examines how strengthening reasoning capabilities (via think-mode activation or fine-tuning on benign math datasets) affects LLM responsiveness to malicious requests. Researchers analyze internal model states including attention patterns and mixture-of-experts mechanisms.

Result: LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is strengthened, with dense models being particularly vulnerable. Both attention shifts and specialized experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards safety guardrails.

Conclusion: The findings reveal an emerging reasoning-safety trade-off in LLMs and underscore the urgent need to advance alignment techniques for advanced reasoning models to prevent security vulnerabilities from enhanced reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: With Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming increasingly widely adopted,
concerns regarding their safety and alignment with human values have
intensified. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning LLMs on narrow and
malicious datasets induce misaligned behaviors. In this work, we report a more
concerning phenomenon, Reasoning-Induced Misalignment. Specifically, we observe
that LLMs become more responsive to malicious requests when reasoning is
strengthened, via switching to "think-mode" or fine-tuning on benign math
datasets, with dense models particularly vulnerable. Moreover, we analyze
internal model states and find that both attention shifts and specialized
experts in mixture-of-experts models help redirect excessive reasoning towards
safety guardrails. These findings provide new insights into the emerging
reasoning-safety trade-off and underscore the urgency of advancing alignment
for advanced reasoning models.

*Lang Xiong,Nishant Bhargava,Wesley Chang,Jianhang Hong,Haihao Liu,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show different behaviors in test vs deployment contexts (evaluation awareness). This study quantifies this by rewriting prompts to be more "deploy-like," finding models become more honest and safer in deployment-style contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmark performance may not reflect true model safety and honesty due to evaluation awareness - the behavioral shift when LLMs perceive different contexts (test vs deployment). This poses critical AI alignment challenges.

Method: Used linear probe to score prompts on "test-like" to "deploy-like" scale, then employed LLM rewriting strategy to shift prompts toward natural deployment context while preserving original tasks.

Result: Rewritten prompts achieved 30% higher average probe score. Models showed 5.26% increase in honest responses, 12.40% decrease in deceptive responses, and 6.38% increase in refusal rates across all tested models.

Conclusion: Evaluation awareness is quantifiable and manipulable, with models being more prone to unsafe/deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. Highlights need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately assess model alignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit significant behavioral shifts when
they perceive a change from a real-world deployment context to a controlled
evaluation setting, a phenomenon known as "evaluation awareness." This
discrepancy poses a critical challenge for AI alignment, as benchmark
performance may not accurately reflect a model's true safety and honesty. In
this work, we systematically quantify these behavioral changes by manipulating
the perceived context of prompts. We introduce a methodology that uses a linear
probe to score prompts on a continuous scale from "test-like" to "deploy-like"
and leverage an LLM rewriting strategy to shift these prompts towards a more
natural, deployment-style context while preserving the original task. Using
this method, we achieved a 30% increase in the average probe score across a
strategic role-playing dataset after rewriting. Evaluating a suite of
state-of-the-art models on these original and rewritten prompts, we find that
rewritten "deploy-like" prompts induce a significant and consistent shift in
behavior. Across all models, we observed an average increase in honest
responses of 5.26% and a corresponding average decrease in deceptive responses
of 12.40%. Furthermore, refusal rates increased by an average of 6.38%,
indicating heightened safety compliance. Our findings demonstrate that
evaluation awareness is a quantifiable and manipulable factor that directly
influences LLM behavior, revealing that models are more prone to unsafe or
deceptive outputs in perceived test environments. This underscores the urgent
need for more realistic evaluation frameworks to accurately gauge true model
alignment before deployment.

*Rishiraj Acharya*

TL;DR: GAM network replaces Transformer's quadratic self-attention with linear-complexity parallel pathways combining causal convolution for local context and associative memory for global patterns, achieving faster training and competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer's quadratic complexity with sequence length creates bottlenecks for long contexts, requiring more efficient alternatives.

Method: GAM uses parallel pathways: causal convolution for local context and associative memory retrieval for global patterns, fused with gating mechanism.

Result: GAM is consistently faster than Transformer and Mamba, achieving superior or competitive perplexity on WikiText-2 and TinyStories datasets.

Conclusion: GAM presents an efficient linear-complexity alternative to Transformers for sequence modeling with strong performance.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism,
has become the de facto standard for sequence modeling tasks. However, its core
computational primitive scales quadratically with sequence length (O(N^2)),
creating a significant bottleneck for processing long contexts. In this paper,
we propose the Gated Associative Memory (GAM) network, a novel, fully parallel
architecture for sequence modeling that exhibits linear complexity (O(N)) with
respect to sequence length. The GAM block replaces the self-attention layer
with two parallel pathways: a causal convolution to efficiently capture local,
position-dependent context, and a parallel associative memory retrieval
mechanism to model global, content-based patterns. These pathways are
dynamically fused using a gating mechanism, allowing the model to flexibly
combine local and global information for each token. We implement GAM from
scratch and conduct a rigorous comparative analysis against a standard
Transformer model and a modern linear-time baseline (Mamba) on the WikiText-2
benchmark, as well as against the Transformer on the TinyStories dataset. Our
experiments demonstrate that GAM is consistently faster, outperforming both
baselines on training speed, and achieves a superior or competitive final
validation perplexity across all datasets, establishing it as a promising and
efficient alternative for sequence modeling.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICPC benchmark with 254 competitive programming problems and shows that advanced LM techniques can significantly improve solve rates from 19.1% to 42.2%, with human guidance further boosting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Competitive programming requires sophisticated algorithmic thinking and serves as a challenging domain to assess language models' capabilities, which hasn't received enough attention in LM evaluation.

Method: Created ICPC benchmark with 254 problems including official analysis, reference code, and tests. Evaluated various LM inference techniques including zero-shot chain-of-thought, multi-turn self-judge with reflection, and retrieval over episodic information.

Result: Zero-shot chain-of-thought achieved 19.1% pass@1 solve rate, while best technique (multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval) reached 42.2%. Human-in-the-loop guidance solved 17/18 previously unsolvable problems.

Conclusion: The study provides a step toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and algorithmic thinking, demonstrating that appropriate techniques and human guidance can significantly enhance LM performance on complex programming tasks.

Abstract: Among the hardest tasks for humans are those found in competitive programming
where problems require sophisticated algorithmic thinking, puzzle solving, and
the creation of effective code. As a domain to assess language models (LMs), it
has not received enough attention, though. This study presents the ICPC
benchmark, which consists of 254 international collegiate programming contest
(ICPC) tasks. Each problem includes official analysis, reference code, and
sample, high-quality unit, and hidden tests. We are able to develop and
evaluate a variety of LM inference techniques for competitive programming with
these resources. With zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, we find that o1
only achieves a 19.1\% pass@1 solve rate. With our best inference technique,
which combines multi-turn self-judge with reflection and retrieval over
episodic information, raises this to 42.2\%. Furthermore, we conduct a new
human-in-the-loop investigation to gain a deeper understanding of the remaining
difficulties. Surprisingly, we discover that o1 can solve 17 out of 18 problems
that were previously unsolvable by any model or technique with just a few
specific instructions. A footstep toward LMs with grounded, imaginative, and
algorithmic thinking is provided by our quantitative findings and qualitative
research. We open-source our code and data at https://github.com/kraritt/zolve.

### [30] [Confident, Calibrated, or Complicit: Probing the Trade-offs between Safety Alignment and Ideological Bias in Language Models in Detecting Hate Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00673)
*Sanjeeevan Selvaganapathy,Mehwish Nasim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs with safety alignment (censored) outperform uncensored models in hate speech detection accuracy (78.7% vs 64.1%) but show ideological anchoring, while uncensored models are more malleable to framing. All models struggle with irony and show fairness disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether uncensored LLMs provide more objective hate speech classification compared to safety-aligned models, and understand the trade-offs between performance and ideological neutrality.

Method: Comparative analysis of censored vs uncensored LLMs on hate speech detection tasks, evaluating accuracy, robustness, ideological consistency, and fairness across different target groups.

Result: Censored models significantly outperformed uncensored ones (78.7% vs 64.1% accuracy) but showed strong ideological anchoring. Uncensored models were highly malleable to persona-based influence. All models failed at irony detection and showed fairness disparities across target groups with unreliable self-confidence metrics.

Conclusion: LLMs cannot be considered objective arbiters for hate speech detection. The research highlights the need for sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency beyond simple accuracy metrics.

Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting
implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety
alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities
compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored
models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral
guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a
surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored
counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1%
strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own
limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making
censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models
prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify
critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as
irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across
different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders
self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs
as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing
frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Router Upcycling improves Mixture-of-Experts upcycling by initializing multiple routers from attention heads for better token routing to specialized experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient training of MoE models remains challenging, and simple routers struggle with complex routing tasks in MoE upcycling, limiting performance.

Method: Initialize multiple routers from attention heads of preceding layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens to experts in an attention-like manner, processing tokens into diverse queries aligned with experts' features as keys.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines in experiments.

Conclusion: Router Upcycling effectively enhances MoE upcycling performance by leveraging attention mechanisms for improved routing, demonstrating superior results compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained significant attention in deep
learning due to their dynamic resource allocation and superior performance
across diverse tasks. However, efficiently training these models remains
challenging. The MoE upcycling technique has been proposed to reuse and improve
existing model components, thereby minimizing training overhead. Despite this,
simple routers, such as linear routers, often struggle with complex routing
tasks within MoE upcycling. In response, we propose a novel routing technique
called Router Upcycling to enhance the performance of MoE upcycling models. Our
approach initializes multiple routers from the attention heads of preceding
attention layers during upcycling. These routers collaboratively assign tokens
to specialized experts in an attention-like manner. Each token is processed
into diverse queries and aligned with the experts' features (serving as keys).
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, outperforming other upcycling baselines.

### [32] [Do small language models generate realistic variable-quality fake news headlines?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00680)
*Austin McCutcheon,Chris Brogly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs can generate fake news headlines with high compliance and low ethical resistance, but current detectors struggle to identify them accurately.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate small language models' capability to generate deceptive fake news headlines and assess how well existing detection systems can identify them.

Method: Tested 14 SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) using controlled prompt engineering to generate 24,000 fake news headlines across quality categories, then applied DistilBERT and bagging classifier models for detection.

Result: SLMs showed high compliance with minimal ethical resistance in generating fake headlines. Detection accuracy was poor (35.2%-63.5%), indicating quality misclassification is common.

Conclusion: SLMs can effectively generate falsified content that current detection systems struggle to identify, highlighting vulnerabilities in fake news detection mechanisms.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) have the capability for text generation and may
potentially be used to generate falsified texts online. This study evaluates 14
SLMs (1.7B-14B parameters) including LLaMA, Gemma, Phi, SmolLM, Mistral, and
Granite families in generating perceived low and high quality fake news
headlines when explicitly prompted, and whether they appear to be similar to
real-world news headlines. Using controlled prompt engineering, 24,000
headlines were generated across low-quality and high-quality deceptive
categories. Existing machine learning and deep learning-based news headline
quality detectors were then applied against these SLM-generated fake news
headlines. SLMs demonstrated high compliance rates with minimal ethical
resistance, though there were some occasional exceptions. Headline quality
detection using established DistilBERT and bagging classifier models showed
that quality misclassification was common, with detection accuracies only
ranging from 35.2% to 63.5%. These findings suggest the following: tested SLMs
generally are compliant in generating falsified headlines, although there are
slight variations in ethical restraints, and the generated headlines did not
closely resemble existing primarily human-written content on the web, given the
low quality classification accuracy.

*Chen Su,Yuanhe Tian,Yan Song,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes TeR model to reinforce text inputs for multimodal time series forecasting, using reinforcement learning to improve text quality and enhance forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal TSF approaches rely on high-quality text inputs, but text often fails to accurately capture historical time series information, leading to unstable performance. There's a need to enhance textual content to improve multimodal TSF reliability.

Method: Text Reinforcement model (TeR) generates reinforced text addressing original text weaknesses. Uses reinforcement learning with rewards based on TSF performance impact and task relevance to optimize text quality.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark dataset across various domains show the approach outperforms strong baselines and existing studies.

Conclusion: Reinforcing text modalities through the proposed TeR model with reinforcement learning effectively improves multimodal time series forecasting performance by addressing text quality issues.

Abstract: Recent studies in time series forecasting (TSF) use multimodal inputs, such
as text and historical time series data, to predict future values. These
studies mainly focus on developing advanced techniques to integrate textual
information with time series data to perform the task and achieve promising
results. Meanwhile, these approaches rely on high-quality text and time series
inputs, whereas in some cases, the text does not accurately or fully capture
the information carried by the historical time series, which leads to unstable
performance in multimodal TSF. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the
textual content to improve the performance of multimodal TSF. In this paper, we
propose improving multimodal TSF by reinforcing the text modalities. We propose
a text reinforcement model (TeR) to generate reinforced text that addresses
potential weaknesses in the original text, then apply this reinforced text to
support the multimodal TSF model's understanding of the time series, improving
TSF performance. To guide the TeR toward producing higher-quality reinforced
text, we design a reinforcement learning approach that assigns rewards based on
the impact of each reinforced text on the performance of the multimodal TSF
model and its relevance to the TSF task. We optimize the TeR accordingly, so as
to improve the quality of the generated reinforced text and enhance TSF
performance. Extensive experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset covering
various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
outperforms strong baselines and existing studies on the dataset.

TL;DR: CE-Bench is a lightweight contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders that measures interpretability without requiring external LLMs, using curated story pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of automated evaluation methods has hindered broader adoption and development of sparse autoencoders for interpretable feature discovery in LLMs.

Method: Built a contrastive evaluation benchmark using curated contrastive story pairs, conducted comprehensive ablation studies to validate effectiveness.

Result: CE-Bench reliably measures interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well with existing benchmarks, all without external LLM requirements.

Conclusion: The approach provides an effective automated evaluation method for sparse autoencoders, with open-source implementation and dataset available.

Abstract: Probing with sparse autoencoders is a promising approach for uncovering
interpretable features in large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
automated evaluation methods has hindered their broader adoption and
development. In this work, we introduce CE-Bench, a novel and lightweight
contrastive evaluation benchmark for sparse autoencoders, built on a curated
dataset of contrastive story pairs. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies
to validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our results show that CE-Bench
reliably measures the interpretability of sparse autoencoders and aligns well
with existing benchmarks, all without requiring an external LLM. The official
implementation and evaluation dataset are open-sourced under the MIT License.

*Kaiwen Wei,Jinpeng Gao,Jiang Zhong,Yuming Yang,Fengmao Lv,Zhenyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RevBrowse is a review-driven LLM recommendation framework that uses PrefRAG to efficiently retrieve relevant reviews for dynamic preference modeling, achieving significant improvements over baselines with enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong potential for recommendation tasks but struggle with efficiently incorporating user reviews due to context window constraints and lack of mechanisms to prioritize context-relevant reviews.

Method: Proposed RevBrowse framework inspired by 'browse-then-decide' process, integrating PrefRAG module that disentangles user/item representations and adaptively retrieves preference-relevant content for target items.

Result: Extensive experiments on four Amazon review datasets show consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, demonstrating generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.

Conclusion: RevBrowse successfully addresses review incorporation challenges in LLM-based recommendation, providing both performance gains and interpretability through transparent retrieval-augmented processes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in recommendation
tasks due to their strengths in language understanding, reasoning and knowledge
integration. These capabilities are especially beneficial for review-based
recommendation, which relies on semantically rich user-generated texts to
reveal fine-grained user preferences and item attributes. However, effectively
incorporating reviews into LLM-based recommendation remains challenging due to
(1) inefficient to dynamically utilize user reviews under LLMs' constrained
context windows, and (2) lacking effective mechanisms to prioritize reviews
most relevant to the user's current decision context. To address these
challenges, we propose RevBrowse, a review-driven recommendation framework
inspired by the "browse-then-decide" decision process commonly observed in
online user behavior. RevBrowse integrates user reviews into the LLM-based
reranking process to enhance its ability to distinguish between candidate
items. To improve the relevance and efficiency of review usage, we introduce
PrefRAG, a retrieval-augmented module that disentangles user and item
representations into structured forms and adaptively retrieves
preference-relevant content conditioned on the target item. Extensive
experiments on four Amazon review datasets demonstrate that RevBrowse achieves
consistent and significant improvements over strong baselines, highlighting its
generalizability and effectiveness in modeling dynamic user preferences.
Furthermore, since the retrieval-augmented process is transparent, RevBrowse
offers a certain level of interpretability by making visible which reviews
influence the final recommendation.

### [36] [Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00707)
*Daehoon Gwak,Minseo Jung,Junwoo Park,Minho Park,ChaeHun Park,Junha Hyung,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS) to improve masked diffusion models by using external reward models for global sequence guidance during decoding, promoting more non-autoregressive generation patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard confidence-based sampling in masked diffusion models results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the benefits of non-autoregressive modeling.

Method: RWS leverages an external reward model to evaluate entire intermediate sequences at each diffusion step and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection with global sequence-level coherence.

Result: RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders and improves performance across multiple evaluation metrics compared to standard decoding methods.

Conclusion: Integrating global signals through reward-weighted sampling effectively enhances both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of masked diffusion models.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive
alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs,
such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on
individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that
this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling
sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of
non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose
Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an
external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the
iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS
evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token
logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global
sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of
tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more
non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical
justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial
rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward.
Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive
generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics.
These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in
enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of
MDMs.

*Houji Jin,Negin Ashrafi,Armin Abdollahi,Wei Liu,Jian Wang,Ganyu Gui,Maryam Pishgar,Huanghao Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Decoder-based LLMs with LoRA fine-tuning outperform encoder models and FastText for Chinese AI-generated text detection, achieving 95.94% accuracy with superior generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of large language models has increased the need for accurate AI-generated text detection, particularly in Chinese where linguistic nuances challenge existing methods.

Method: Systematic comparison of encoder Transformers (Chinese BERT-large, RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), decoder-only LLM (Qwen2.5-7B fine-tuned via LoRA), and FastText baseline using NLPCC 2025 dataset. Encoder models used prompt-based masked language modeling, while Qwen2.5-7B used instruction-format input with classification head.

Result: Encoder models suffered performance degradation under distribution shifts (76.3-79.3% accuracy). FastText showed lexical robustness (83.5%) but lacked semantic understanding. LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieved 95.94% test accuracy with balanced precision-recall metrics.

Conclusion: Decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) are highly effective for robust Chinese AI-generated text detection, demonstrating superior generalization and resilience to dataset artifacts.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has heightened the demand
for accurate detection of AI-generated text, particularly in languages like
Chinese, where subtle linguistic nuances pose significant challenges to current
methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic comparison of encoder-based
Transformers (Chinese BERT-large and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large), a decoder-only LLM
(Alibaba's Qwen2.5-7B/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B fine-tuned via Low-Rank
Adaptation, LoRA), and a FastText baseline using the publicly available dataset
from the NLPCC 2025 Chinese AI-Generated Text Detection Task. Encoder models
were fine-tuned using a novel prompt-based masked language modeling approach,
while Qwen2.5-7B was adapted for classification with an instruction-format
input and a lightweight classification head trained via LoRA. Experiments
reveal that although encoder models nearly memorize training data, they suffer
significant performance degradation under distribution shifts (RoBERTa: 76.3%
test accuracy; BERT: 79.3%). FastText demonstrates surprising lexical
robustness (83.5% accuracy) yet lacks deeper semantic understanding. In
contrast, the LoRA-adapted Qwen2.5-7B achieves 95.94% test accuracy with
balanced precision-recall metrics, indicating superior generalization and
resilience to dataset-specific artifacts. These findings underscore the
efficacy of decoder-based LLMs with parameter-efficient fine-tuning for robust
Chinese AI-generated text detection. Future work will explore next-generation
Qwen3 models, distilled variants, and ensemble strategies to enhance
cross-domain robustness further.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FIDES is a new framework that improves attribution in QA by using contextually enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation, outperforming SOTA methods by over 14%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current question decomposition approaches for LLM QA attribution generate irrelevant/incomplete questions, lose facts during retrieval, and fail to aggregate evidence from different sources effectively.

Method: Uses two-stage faithful decomposition to break answers into sub-facts, retrieves evidence snippets, revises conflicting sub-facts, and aggregates evidence according to original sentences.

Result: Outperforms SOTA methods by over 14% across GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series on six datasets, with new Attr_auto-P metric showing improved evidence precision.

Conclusion: FIDES provides a more effective framework for attributed QA through improved fact decomposition and evidence aggregation, significantly enhancing attribution performance.

Abstract: Attribution is crucial in question answering (QA) with Large Language Models
(LLMs).SOTA question decomposition-based approaches use long form answers to
generate questions for retrieving related documents. However, the generated
questions are often irrelevant and incomplete, resulting in a loss of facts in
retrieval.These approaches also fail to aggregate evidence snippets from
different documents and paragraphs. To tackle these problems, we propose a new
fact decomposition-based framework called FIDES (\textit{faithful context
enhanced fact decomposition and evidence aggregation}) for attributed QA. FIDES
uses a contextually enhanced two-stage faithful decomposition method to
decompose long form answers into sub-facts, which are then used by a retriever
to retrieve related evidence snippets. If the retrieved evidence snippets
conflict with the related sub-facts, such sub-facts will be revised
accordingly. Finally, the evidence snippets are aggregated according to the
original sentences.Extensive evaluation has been conducted with six datasets,
with an additionally proposed new metric called $Attr_{auto-P}$ for evaluating
the evidence precision. FIDES outperforms the SOTA methods by over 14\% in
average with GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini and Llama 70B series.

*Weizhe Shi,Qiqi Wang,Yihong Pan,Qian Liu,Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Judicial Opinion Generation task and LegalChainReasoner framework to simultaneously generate legal reasoning and sentencing decisions using structured legal chains, outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches separate legal reasoning and sentencing prediction, leading to inconsistency and limited practical deployment. Real-world judicial requirements need integrated opinion generation.

Method: LegalChainReasoner framework applies structured legal chains to guide comprehensive case assessments, integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions for end-to-end opinion generation.

Result: Experiments on two real-world Chinese legal case datasets show the method outperforms baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed approach better aligns with legal practice by ensuring consistency between reasoning and sentencing through flexible knowledge injection and integrated generation.

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case,
including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such
opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with
references to similar past cases. However, current research typically
approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning
and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between
the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial
requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to
enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment.
To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a
new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces
both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce
LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide
the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual
premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach
ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation.
Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLaMA 3 8B on biomedical QA data shows strong semantic understanding (0.8 accuracy) but struggles with exact match scores, requiring two-stage inference for better output formatting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigorous evaluation of LLMs is essential before deployment in real-world biomedical applications, particularly for complex multi-hop question answering involving diseases, genes, and chemicals.

Method: Supervised fine-tuning of LLaMA 3 8B using curated biomedical datasets (BioASQ, MedQuAD, TREC) with three experimental setups: combined answers, short answers only, and long answers only, plus a two-stage inference pipeline for precise answer extraction.

Result: Models achieved concept-level accuracy scores up to 0.8 but showed significantly lower Exact Match scores, especially in test phase. Two-stage inference provided partial improvements but challenges in strict output formatting persisted.

Conclusion: There's a significant gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLMs, highlighting the need for further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question
answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their
performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before
deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper
presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task,
which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases,
genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging
LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled
from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental
setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short
answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain
understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their
Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test
phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer
extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics.
Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly
formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic
understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications,
motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

*Felix Engl,Andreas Henrich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Topic Model Translation (TMT) enables transferring topic models between languages without aligned corpora or metadata, making multilingual topic modeling accessible even with limited target language data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual topic modeling is challenging due to requirements for aligned corpora, sophisticated algorithms, and manual evaluation, especially when developers lack target language knowledge or have limited data availability.

Method: TMT is a novel technique that transfers topic models (like LDA) from one language to another without needing metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora, enabling cross-language topic model reuse.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows TMT produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations through both quantitative and qualitative methods.

Conclusion: TMT provides a robust and transparent solution for multilingual topic modeling that works effectively even when large target language corpora are unavailable or manual translation is impractical.

Abstract: The training of topic models for a multilingual environment is a challenging
task, requiring the use of sophisticated algorithms, topic-aligned corpora, and
manual evaluation. These difficulties are further exacerbated when the
developer lacks knowledge of the target language or is working in an
environment with limited data, where only small or unusable multilingual
corpora are available.
  Considering these challenges, we introduce Topic Model Translation (TMT), a
novel, robust and transparent technique designed to transfer topic models
(e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) based topic models) from one language
to another, without the need for metadata, embeddings, or aligned corpora. TMT
enables the reuse of topic models across languages, making it especially
suitable for scenarios where large corpora in the target language are
unavailable or manual translation is infeasible. Furthermore, we evaluate TMT
extensively using both quantitative and qualitative methods, demonstrating that
it produces semantically coherent and consistent topic translations.

TL;DR: Small models (<13B params) for dialogue evaluation using LM prompting and encoder-based models, achieving modest results with LM ranking second on test set despite score distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the crucial challenge of evaluating generative AI-based dialogue systems through the DSTC-12 Track 1 competition, focusing on dimension-specific score prediction.

Method: Two main strategies: 1) Using Language Models as evaluators through prompting, 2) Training encoder-based classification and regression models with fewer parameters.

Result: LM prompting achieved modest correlations with human judgments but ranked second on test set. Encoder models showed high correlation on validation set but performance dropped on test set due to different score distributions.

Conclusion: While both approaches show promise, performance is affected by dataset distribution shifts. LM prompting demonstrates competitive performance despite modest correlations, suggesting potential for further optimization.

Abstract: The growing number of generative AI-based dialogue systems has made their
evaluation a crucial challenge. This paper presents our contribution to this
important problem through the Dialogue System Technology Challenge (DSTC-12,
Track 1), where we developed models to predict dialogue-level,
dimension-specific scores. Given the constraint of using relatively small
models (i.e. fewer than 13 billion parameters) our work follows two main
strategies: employing Language Models (LMs) as evaluators through prompting,
and training encoder-based classification and regression models.
  Our results show that while LM prompting achieves only modest correlations
with human judgments, it still ranks second on the test set, outperformed only
by the baseline. The regression and classification models, with significantly
fewer parameters, demonstrate high correlation for some dimensions on the
validation set. Although their performance decreases on the test set, it is
important to note that the test set contains annotations with significantly
different score ranges for some of the dimensions with respect to the train and
validation sets.

### [44] [Negative Matters: Multi-Granularity Hard-Negative Synthesis and Anchor-Token-Aware Pooling for Enhanced Text Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00842)
*Tengyu Pan,Zhichao Duan,Zhenyu Li,Bowen Dong,Ning Liu,Xiuxing Li,Jianyong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using LLMs to generate multi-granularity hard negatives and anchor token aware pooling for improved text embedding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative samples are critical for contrastive learning in text embedding models, but existing methods lack diverse hard negatives with varying similarity levels to effectively train models to discern subtle semantic distinctions.

Method: Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework using LLMs to generate diverse negative samples with varying similarity levels, combined with Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling that assigns higher weights to anchor tokens based on LLM aggregation patterns.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on MTEB benchmark, surpassing existing synthesis strategies with both synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MGH framework and ATA pooling method effectively improve text embedding accuracy through better negative sample generation and token weighting, demonstrating superior performance without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing
tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense
vector representations. These models are typically optimized using triplets of
(query, positive, negative) data pairs for contrastive learning, where the
negative samples play a critical role in enhancing the model's ability to
discern subtle semantic distinctions. In this work, we introduce a
Multi-Granularity Hard-negative (MGH) synthesis framework that leverages large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse negative samples with varying levels
of similarity with the query. This approach facilitates a coarse-to-fine
curriculum learning strategy during supervised training, allowing the embedding
model to progressively learn more nuanced semantic representations. Meanwhile,
we propose an Anchor Token Aware (ATA) pooling method that assigns higher
weights to anchor tokens based on aggregation patterns observed in LLMs,
improving text embedding accuracy without increasing model complexity.
Comprehensive experiments on the MTEB benchmark demonstrate that our methods
achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing synthesis strategies
both with synthetic data and when combined with public retrieval datasets.

*Shaina Raza,Maximus Powers,Partha Pratim Saha,Mahveen Raza,Rizwan Qureshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTI models amplify social biases in occupational portrayals. A benchmark study shows prompting can shift demographic representations but with model-specific effects, highlighting both promise and limitations of prompting as a fairness intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-Image models risk amplifying harmful social biases, particularly in occupational portrayals, requiring systematic assessment and intervention strategies.

Method: Created a benchmark of occupational portrayals (CEO, Nurse, Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete) using 5 TTI models. Compared neutral prompts vs fairness-aware controlled prompts, annotated outputs for gender and race distribution.

Result: Prompting can substantially shift demographic representations but with highly model-specific effects - some diversify effectively, others overcorrect into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness.

Conclusion: Prompting shows promise but has limitations as a fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level strategies to address representational biases in TTI systems.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (TTI) models are powerful creative tools but risk amplifying
harmful social biases. We frame representational societal bias assessment as an
image curation and evaluation task and introduce a pilot benchmark of
occupational portrayals spanning five socially salient roles (CEO, Nurse,
Software Engineer, Teacher, Athlete). Using five state-of-the-art models:
closed-source (DALLE 3, Gemini Imagen 4.0) and open-source (FLUX.1-dev, Stable
Diffusion XL Turbo, Grok-2 Image), we compare neutral baseline prompts against
fairness-aware controlled prompts designed to encourage demographic diversity.
All outputs are annotated for gender (male, female) and race (Asian, Black,
White), enabling structured distributional analysis. Results show that
prompting can substantially shift demographic representations, but with highly
model-specific effects: some systems diversify effectively, others overcorrect
into unrealistic uniformity, and some show little responsiveness. These
findings highlight both the promise and the limitations of prompting as a
fairness intervention, underscoring the need for complementary model-level
strategies. We release all code and data for transparency and reproducibility

*Zixuan Shangguan,Yanjie Dong,Lanjun Wang,Xiaoyi Fan,Victor C. M. Leung,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to mitigate fawning hallucinations in LLMs where models prioritize alignment with deceptive prompts over factual accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate inaccurate responses when aligning with deceptive/misleading prompts, prioritizing user alignment over truthfulness - a phenomenon called fawning hallucinations.

Method: Designs two paradigms to generate deceptive inputs for consistent hallucination induction, then proposes CCD to contrast output distributions between induced and neutral inputs without additional training.

Result: Extensive experiments show CCD effectively mitigates fawning hallucinations and improves response factuality across various NLP tasks.

Conclusion: CCD provides an effective training-free solution to reduce LLMs' reliance on deceptive information and enhance factual accuracy in generated responses.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in
language understanding. However, when LLMs align their outputs with deceptive
and/or misleading prompts, the generated responses could deviate from the de
facto information. Such observations are known as fawning hallucinations, where
the model prioritizes alignment with the input's implied perspective over
accuracy and truthfulness. In this work, we analyze fawning hallucinations in
various natural language processing tasks and tailor the so-termed contrastive
decoding method for fawning-hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we design
two paradigms to generate corresponding deceptive and/or misleading inputs for
the consistent fawning hallucinations induction. Then, we propose the
collaborative contrastive decoding (CCD) to handle the fawning hallucinations
across different tasks in LLMs. By contrasting the deviation in output
distribution between induced and transformed neutral inputs, the proposed CCD
can reduce reliance on deceptive and/or misleading information without
requiring additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed CCD can effectively mitigate fawning hallucinations and improve the
factuality of the generated responses over various tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EviNote-RAG is an agentic RAG framework that replaces conventional retrieve-then-answer with a structured retrieve-note-answer pipeline, using Supportive-Evidence Notes and Evidence Quality Reward to improve QA accuracy and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of conventional RAG systems: low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence and error accumulation in multi-hop reasoning when dealing with incomplete or noisy passages.

Method: Introduces Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs) - concise human-like notes preserving only answer-relevant information, and Evidence Quality Reward (EQR) - an entailment-based signal evaluating whether SENs logically support the final answer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results with relative F1 gains of 20% on HotpotQA, 40% on Bamboogle, and 91% on 2Wiki, showing improved accuracy, generalization, and training stability.

Conclusion: EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines, enhancing robustness and efficiency through denser rewards and reduced verbosity in QA tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with retrieval mechanisms have
achieved strong progress in open-domain question answering (QA). Yet, the
conventional retrieve--then--answer paradigm often suffers from two key
limitations: (1) low signal-to-noise ratio in retrieved evidence, where useful
information is buried under irrelevant content, and (2) error accumulation in
multi-hop reasoning when incomplete or noisy passages are involved. To address
these challenges, we present EviNote-RAG, an agentic RAG framework that
introduces a structured retrieve--note--answer pipeline. Instead of directly
reasoning over raw retrievals, the model is trained to compose
Supportive-Evidence Notes (SENs), concise, human-like notes that preserve only
answer-relevant information, highlight uncertainty, and explicitly state when
no useful evidence exists. This distillation process is further reinforced by
the Evidence Quality Reward (EQR), an entailment-based signal that evaluates
whether SENs logically support the final answer. Together, SENs and EQR guide
the model toward faithful and robust reasoning, while reducing the impact of
noise. Experiments on in-domain and out-of-domain QA benchmarks show that
EviNote-RAG consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy,
generalization, and training stability. In particular, it achieves
state-of-the-art results while enhancing robustness and efficiency, yielding
relative F1 gains of 20\% on HotpotQA (+0.093), 40\% on Bamboogle (+0.151), and
91\% on 2Wiki (+0.256) via denser rewards and reduced verbosity.

### [48] [SeLeRoSa: Sentence-Level Romanian Satire Detection Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00893)
*Răzvan-Alexandru Smădu,Andreea Iuga,Dumitru-Clementin Cercel,Florin Pop*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First Romanian sentence-level satire detection dataset (SeLeRoSa) with 13,873 annotated sentences, evaluated with LLMs showing current limitations in detecting satirical content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satire, irony and sarcasm can be mistaken for factual reporting like fake news, and there's a need for granular detection at sentence level in news articles, particularly for Romanian language which lacks such resources.

Method: Created SeLeRoSa dataset with manual sentence-level annotations across multiple domains, then evaluated various LLMs (both zero-shot and fine-tuned) and transformer models for satire detection performance.

Result: Current large language models and transformer-based approaches show significant limitations in effectively detecting sentence-level satire, indicating the task remains challenging.

Conclusion: The research highlights the difficulty of satire detection even for advanced LLMs, establishing a benchmark dataset and paving the way for future improvements in this NLP task.

Abstract: Satire, irony, and sarcasm are techniques typically used to express humor and
critique, rather than deceive; however, they can occasionally be mistaken for
factual reporting, akin to fake news. These techniques can be applied at a more
granular level, allowing satirical information to be incorporated into news
articles. In this paper, we introduce the first sentence-level dataset for
Romanian satire detection for news articles, called SeLeRoSa. The dataset
comprises 13,873 manually annotated sentences spanning various domains,
including social issues, IT, science, and movies. With the rise and recent
progress of large language models (LLMs) in the natural language processing
literature, LLMs have demonstrated enhanced capabilities to tackle various
tasks in zero-shot settings. We evaluate multiple baseline models based on LLMs
in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, as well as baseline
transformer-based models. Our findings reveal the current limitations of these
models in the sentence-level satire detection task, paving the way for new
research directions.

### [49] [Supervised In-Context Fine-Tuning for Generative Sequence Labeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00921)
*David Dukić,Goran Glavaš,Jan Šnajder*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes SIFT (supervised in-context fine-tuning) for generative sequence labeling, combining in-context learning with supervised fine-tuning to outperform existing methods on standard SL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sequence labeling tasks are typically handled by encoder-only models, but causal LLMs have scaling advantages and should outperform encoders. However, less work has focused on generative SL which is more natural for causal LLMs.

Method: SIFT casts sequence labeling as constrained response generation, combining in-context learning from demonstrations with supervised fine-tuning. It removes the causal mask and uses a response-based generative formulation.

Result: SIFT considerably outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on standard SL tasks. Long context hinders performance but this can be mitigated by removing instructions, which are shown to be largely unnecessary.

Conclusion: Response-based generative task formulation is crucial for effective sequence labeling with LLMs. SIFT demonstrates the strengths of this approach while highlighting limitations related to context length and instruction necessity.

Abstract: Sequence labeling (SL) tasks, where labels are assigned to tokens, are
abundant in NLP (e.g., named entity recognition and aspect-based sentiment
analysis). Owing to the intuition that they require bidirectional context, SL
tasks are commonly tackled with encoder-only models. Recent work also shows
that removing the causal mask in fine-tuning enables decoder-based LLMs to
become effective token classifiers. Less work, however, focused on (supervised)
generative SL, a more natural setting for causal LLMs. Due to their rapid
scaling, causal LLMs applied to SL are expected to outperform encoders, whose
own development has stagnated. In this work, we propose supervised in-context
fine-tuning (SIFT) for generative SL. SIFT casts SL tasks as constrained
response generation, natural to LLMs, combining (1) in-context learning (ICL)
from demonstrations with (2) supervised fine-tuning. SIFT considerably
outperforms both ICL and decoder-as-encoder fine-tuning baselines on a range of
standard SL tasks. We further find that although long context hinders the
performance of generative SL in both ICL and SIFT, this deficiency can be
mitigated by removing the instruction, as instructions are shown to be largely
unnecessary for achieving strong SL performance with SIFT. Our findings
highlight strengths and limitations of SL with LLMs, underscoring the
importance of a response-based generative task formulation for effective SL
performance.

TL;DR: MedCOD framework integrates UMLS and LLM-KB knowledge to improve English-Spanish medical translation, achieving state-of-the-art results with structured prompting and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance medical translation quality by integrating domain-specific structured knowledge from medical dictionaries and LLMs into the translation process, addressing the challenges of medical terminology accuracy.

Method: Hybrid framework combining UMLS knowledge and LLM-KB paradigm with structured prompting (multilingual variants, medical synonyms, UMLS definitions) and LoRA-based fine-tuning on 2,999 parallel medical articles.

Result: Significant translation quality improvements across all tested LLMs, with Phi-4 achieving BLEU 44.23, chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, outperforming GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini baselines.

Conclusion: Structured knowledge integration through MedCOD framework effectively enhances LLM performance for medical translation, with both prompting and adaptation contributing to gains.

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed
to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating
domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD
integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language
System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance
structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999
English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with
structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B,
Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that
incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived
definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results
demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all
models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23,
chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o
and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model
adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their
combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the
potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical
translation tasks.

*Yihong Chen*

TL;DR: This thesis bridges structured (knowledge graphs) and unstructured (large language models) NLP paradigms through complementary structure and destructure forces, creating a new framework for transparent and adaptable knowledge engines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish conceptual connections between the seemingly distinct structured and unstructured paradigms in natural language processing, which have developed separately with knowledge graphs vs large language models.

Method: Identifies two complementary forces - structure (organizing symbolic interactions) and destructure (periodic embedding resets to improve model plasticity and generalization). Uses these to bridge the paradigms.

Result: Develops a new recipe for creating general knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable intelligent systems by combining insights from both paradigms.

Conclusion: The structure-destructure framework provides a unified approach to developing knowledge engines that leverage the strengths of both structured symbolic systems and unstructured large-scale language models.

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been
shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the
other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm
leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors
and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm
centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and
model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence,
this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms.
Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both
paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure,
through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization
to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general
knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable
intelligent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPRO is a novel framework combining reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought performance in medical question answering, outperforming larger models with a compact 1.1B parameter architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical reliability in medical question answering, requiring a more robust approach to ensure clinical validity.

Method: RPRO combines reinforcement learning with preference-driven reasoning refinement using task-adaptive reasoning templates, probabilistic evaluation mechanism, groupwise ranking optimization based on Bradley-Terry model, and KL-divergence regularization.

Result: Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE show consistent improvements over strong baselines, with the 1.1B parameter model outperforming much larger 7B-13B models including medical-specialized variants.

Conclusion: Combining preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

Abstract: Medical question answering requires advanced reasoning that integrates domain
knowledge with logical inference. However, existing large language models
(LLMs) often generate reasoning chains that lack factual accuracy and clinical
reliability. We propose Ranked Preference Reinforcement Optimization (RPRO), a
novel framework that uniquely combines reinforcement learning with
preference-driven reasoning refinement to enhance clinical chain-of-thought
(CoT) performance. RPRO differentiates itself from prior approaches by
employing task-adaptive reasoning templates and a probabilistic evaluation
mechanism that aligns outputs with established clinical workflows, while
automatically identifying and correcting low-quality reasoning chains. Unlike
traditional pairwise preference methods, RPRO introduces a groupwise ranking
optimization based on the Bradley-Terry model and incorporates KL-divergence
regularization for stable training. Experiments on PubMedQA and MedQA-USMLE
show consistent improvements over strong baselines. Remarkably, our 1.1B
parameter model outperforms much larger 7B-13B models, including
medical-specialized variants. These findings demonstrate that combining
preference optimization with quality-driven refinement offers a scalable and
effective approach to building more reliable, clinically grounded medical LLMs.

TL;DR: Research on ranking Bangla words using graph-based algorithms applied to word graphs constructed from text, with evaluation using F1 measure on Indian Language POS-tag Corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of standard Bangla word database and ranking methods, making it important to develop effective word ranking techniques for text summarization and information retrieval in Bangla language.

Method: Construct word graphs from Bangla text where words are vertices and relationships are edges. Apply various graph-based ranking algorithms after preprocessing steps. Use Indian Language POS-tag Corpora as the dataset with part-of-speech tagged sentences.

Result: Experimental results on real data show the accuracy of different ranking algorithms measured by F1 score, providing comparative analysis of their performance.

Conclusion: The research successfully demonstrates a complete procedure for ranking Bangla words using graph-based approaches, establishing a framework for word importance assessment in Bangla text processing.

Abstract: Ranking words is an important way to summarize a text or to retrieve
information. A word graph is a way to represent the words of a sentence or a
text as the vertices of a graph and to show the relationship among the words.
It is also useful to determine the relative importance of a word among the
words in the word-graph. In this research, the ranking of Bangla words are
calculated, representing Bangla words from a text in a word graph using various
graph based ranking algorithms. There is a lack of a standard Bangla word
database. In this research, the Indian Language POS-tag Corpora is used, which
has a rich collection of Bangla words in the form of sentences with their parts
of speech tags. For applying a word graph to various graph based ranking
algorithms, several standard procedures are applied. The preprocessing steps
are done in every word graph and then applied to graph based ranking algorithms
to make a comparison among these algorithms. This paper illustrate the entire
procedure of calculating the ranking of Bangla words, including the
construction of the word graph from text. Experimental result analysis on real
data reveals the accuracy of each ranking algorithm in terms of F1 measure.

TL;DR: TaarofBench is the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of Persian taarof, revealing significant cultural competence gaps in current models and showing improvements through fine-tuning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with culturally specific communication norms like Persian taarof, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts where such sophisticated ritual politeness systems are essential.

Method: Created TaarofBench with 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 social interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Evaluated 5 frontier LLMs, conducted human study with 33 participants, and applied supervised fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: LLMs showed 40-48% accuracy gap compared to native speakers. Performance varied by topic, improved with Persian prompts, and showed gender-based asymmetries. Fine-tuning achieved 21.8-42.3% improvement in cultural alignment.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for developing culturally aware LLMs that can better navigate complex social interactions, highlighting the limitations of Western politeness frameworks for global applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle to navigate culturally specific
communication norms, limiting their effectiveness in global contexts. We focus
on Persian taarof, a social norm in Iranian interactions, which is a
sophisticated system of ritual politeness that emphasizes deference, modesty,
and indirectness, yet remains absent from existing cultural benchmarks. We
introduce TaarofBench, the first benchmark for evaluating LLM understanding of
taarof, comprising 450 role-play scenarios covering 12 common social
interaction topics, validated by native speakers. Our evaluation of five
frontier LLMs reveals substantial gaps in cultural competence, with accuracy
rates 40-48% below native speakers when taarof is culturally appropriate.
Performance varies between interaction topics, improves with Persian-language
prompts, and exhibits gender-based asymmetries. We also show that responses
rated "polite" by standard metrics often violate taarof norms, indicating the
limitations of Western politeness frameworks. Through supervised fine-tuning
and Direct Preference Optimization, we achieve 21.8% and 42.3% improvement in
model alignment with cultural expectations. Our human study with 33
participants (11 native Persian, 11 heritage, and 11 non-Iranian speakers)
forms baselines in varying degrees of familiarity with Persian norms. This work
lays the foundation for developing diverse and culturally aware LLMs, enabling
applications that better navigate complex social interactions.

TL;DR: Proposes a novel metric and fusion-based approach for maintaining style consistency in automated crisis response generation, outperforming baselines in both quality and uniformity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical need for stylistic consistency in automated crisis communications to build trust with affected populations, as current methods often overlook this important factor.

Method: Two-stage process: first assesses style of candidate responses, then optimizes and integrates them through instance-level fusion to reduce stylistic variation while maintaining quality.

Result: Experimental results across multiple datasets show the approach consistently outperforms baselines in both response quality and stylistic uniformity.

Conclusion: The proposed fusion-based generation method effectively addresses the gap in maintaining stylistic consistency for automated crisis communications, providing more trustworthy and reliable responses.

Abstract: In response to the urgent need for effective communication with
crisis-affected populations, automated responses driven by language models have
been proposed to assist in crisis communications. A critical yet often
overlooked factor is the consistency of response style, which could affect the
trust of affected individuals in responders. Despite its importance, few
studies have explored methods for maintaining stylistic consistency across
generated responses. To address this gap, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating style consistency and introduce a fusion-based generation approach
grounded in this metric. Our method employs a two-stage process: it first
assesses the style of candidate responses and then optimizes and integrates
them at the instance level through a fusion process. This enables the
generation of high-quality responses while significantly reducing stylistic
variation between instances. Experimental results across multiple datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines in both
response quality and stylistic uniformity.

TL;DR: A framework called Controlled-Literacy uses RAG with RL to generate health misinformation counterspeech tailored to different health literacy levels, outperforming uniform response approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Health misinformation online threatens public health, and existing counterspeech methods produce uniform responses that ignore how audience health literacy affects accessibility and effectiveness.

Method: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels, using a reward function that combines user preferences and readability-based rewards.

Result: Controlled-Literacy outperforms baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech adapted to target health literacy levels.

Conclusion: This research improves public health communication equity by enhancing counterspeech accessibility and comprehension for diverse health literacy audiences.

Abstract: Health misinformation spreading online poses a significant threat to public
health. Researchers have explored methods for automatically generating
counterspeech to health misinformation as a mitigation strategy. Existing
approaches often produce uniform responses, ignoring that the health literacy
level of the audience could affect the accessibility and effectiveness of
counterspeech. We propose a Controlled-Literacy framework using
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
generate tailored counterspeech adapted to different health literacy levels. In
particular, we retrieve knowledge aligned with specific health literacy levels,
enabling accessible and factual information to support generation. We design a
reward function incorporating subjective user preferences and objective
readability-based rewards to optimize counterspeech to the target health
literacy level. Experiment results show that Controlled-Literacy outperforms
baselines by generating more accessible and user-preferred counterspeech. This
research contributes to more equitable and impactful public health
communication by improving the accessibility and comprehension of counterspeech
to health misinformation.

TL;DR: Evaluation of 7 LLMs on Islamic inheritance law knowledge shows significant performance gap - o3 and Gemini 2.5 excel (>90% accuracy) while ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral struggle (<50%) with legal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in the specialized domain of Islamic inheritance law ('ilm al-mawarith), which requires understanding complex legal rules and computational distribution of shares.

Method: Used a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios to test models' ability to understand inheritance context and compute share distributions prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence.

Result: Significant performance gap observed: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, while ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. Error analysis revealed recurring failure patterns including scenario misunderstandings, incorrect rule application, and insufficient domain knowledge.

Conclusion: LLMs show limitations in structured legal reasoning for Islamic jurisprudence. The findings highlight important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation, suggesting directions for improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning tasks.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We
assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice
questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models'
ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of
shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant
performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas
ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect
important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a
detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models,
including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of
legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight
limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for
improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning. Code:

### [59] [A Paradigm Gap in Urdu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01084)
*Farah Adeeba,Rajesh Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The perfective form of the -ya: kar construction in Urdu became ungrammatical due to a morphosyntactic conflict between nominative subject requirements and ergative case assignment rules in transitive perfectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate why the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction, which was freely used in 19th century Urdu literature, became sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and Hindi.

Method: Historical text analysis, large-scale corpus study confirming absence of perfective forms, and subjective evaluation tasks with native speakers judging perfective examples.

Result: Perfective forms are absent from modern usage and judged as highly unnatural by native speakers, confirming a diachronic shift from 19th century to modern grammar.

Conclusion: The grammatical gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic conflict between the construction's requirements and core grammatical rules, making the perfective form unstable and leading to its functional replacement by other constructions.

Abstract: In this paper, we document a paradigm gap in the combinatorial possibilities
of verbs and aspect in Urdu: the perfective form of the -ya: kar construction
(e.g. ro-ya: ki: cry-Pfv do.Pfv) is sharply ungrammatical in modern Urdu and
Hindi, despite being freely attested in 19th century literature. We investigate
this diachronic shift through historical text analysis, a large-scale corpus
study which confirms the stark absence of perfective forms and subjective
evaluation tasks with native speakers, who judge perfective examples as highly
unnatural. We argue that this gap arose from a fundamental morphosyntactic
conflict: the construction's requirement for a nominative subject and an
invariant participle clashes with the core grammatical rule that transitive
perfective assign ergative case. This conflict rendered the perfective form
unstable, and its functional replacement by other constructions allowed the gap
to become entrenched in the modern grammar.

### [60] [Privacy-Preserving Reasoning with Knowledge-Distilled Parametric Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01088)
*Jinwen Chen,Hainan Zhang,Liang Pang,Yongxin Tong,Haibo Zhou,Yuan Zhan,Wei Lin,Zhiming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DistilledPRAG is a privacy-preserving parametric RAG system that encodes documents as LoRA parameters without exposing raw content, achieving better accuracy and generalization than previous methods while maintaining RAG-level performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems risk private data leakage by uploading plaintext documents to cloud. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses privacy but has high latency and poor generalization due to reliance on synthetic QA data and lack of alignment with standard RAG.

Method: Proposes DistilledPRAG with three steps: (1) synthesizes QA pairs from single/multi-documents for cross-document reasoning, (2) masks plaintext documents and translates to LoRA via parameter generator while maintaining RAG document structure, (3) trains parameter generator to match standard RAG's hidden states and output logits using synthetic QA guidance.

Result: Experiments on four QA datasets show DistilledPRAG outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data.

Conclusion: DistilledPRAG successfully achieves high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level performance, solving the critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning without exposing original documents.

Abstract: The current RAG system requires uploading plaintext documents to the cloud,
risking private data leakage. Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by encoding
documents as LoRA within LLMs, enabling reasoning without exposing raw content.
However, it still faces two issues: (1) PRAG demands synthesizing QA pairs and
fine-tuning LLM for each individual document to create its corresponding LoRA,
leading to unacceptable inference latency. (2) The performance of PRAG relies
solely on synthetic QA data, lacking internal alignment with standard RAG,
resulting in poor generalization on out-of-distribution(OOD) inputs. Therefore,
achieving high-efficiency parameterization while maintaining RAG-level
performance remains a critical challenge for privacy-preserving reasoning. In
this paper, we propose DistilledPRAG, a generalizable knowledge-distilled
parametric RAG model aligned with standard RAG in document structure and
parameter activation. We first synthesize QA pairs from single and
multi-documents to enhance cross-document reasoning. Then, we mask the
plaintext documents with a special token and translate them to LoRA via a
parameter generator, maintaining the standard RAG document structure. Finally,
guided by synthetic QA data, we train the parameter generator to match standard
RAG's hidden states and output logits, enabling RAG-style reasoning without
original documents. Experiments on four QA datasets show that DistilledPRAG
outperforms baselines in accuracy and generalizes well on OOD data.

*Xiaoqiang Lin,Aritra Ghosh,Bryan Kian Hsiang Low,Anshumali Shrivastava,Vijai Mohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFRAG is an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications by exploiting sparsity in retrieved passages, achieving 30.85% speedup without performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG applications face significant latency and memory issues due to processing long-context inputs with mostly irrelevant retrieved passages, creating a trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency.

Method: Proposes REFRAG framework that compresses, senses, and expands to eliminate unnecessary computations over RAG context by exploiting block-diagonal attention patterns and sparsity structure in retrieved passages.

Result: Achieves 30.85% time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75x improvement over previous work) without loss in perplexity, extends context size by 16x, and maintains accuracy across diverse long-context tasks including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and document summarization.

Conclusion: REFRAG effectively addresses the latency-efficiency trade-off in RAG applications by leveraging sparsity patterns, delivering substantial speedup with no accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and
agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and
demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced
throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system
efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary
objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In
RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval,
with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often
exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during
re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those
in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most
computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be
eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG,
an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve
latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we
demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to
previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization
framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs
by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context
tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document
summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm
that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to
LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

*Yulong Wu,Viktor Schlegel,Riza Batista-Navarro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM performance on question answering declines as reading passages naturally diverge from pretraining content, even when all necessary information remains present.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how natural evolution of context paragraphs affects question answering performance in generative LLMs, particularly as text content changes over time from pretraining versions.

Method: Proposed a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of reading passages from QA benchmarks, analyzing LLM performance across semantic similarity scores that quantify alignment with pretraining content.

Result: Experiments on six QA datasets and eight LLMs showed performance declines as passages diverge from pretraining versions. BoolQ accuracy dropped over 30% from highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding 70 across several models.

Conclusion: Natural text evolution poses a significant challenge to LLM language understanding capabilities, as performance decreases when content differs from what was seen during pretraining.

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question
answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we
propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of
reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM
performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how
closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this
framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available
training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading
passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during
pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains
present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops
by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding
70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution
poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of
LLMs.

TL;DR: Dream-Coder 7B is an open-source discrete diffusion language model for code generation that adaptively chooses decoding strategies based on task complexity, achieving 21.4% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional autoregressive models decode strictly left-to-right, which may not be optimal for different coding tasks. The authors aim to create a model that can adapt its decoding strategy based on the complexity and nature of the coding problem.

Method: Adapted a pretrained AR checkpoint to discrete diffusion framework with continuous-time weighted cross-entropy objective. Used supervised fine-tuning with random truncation and padding penalty, followed by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on curated prompt sets.

Result: Achieved 21.4% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410-2505) and demonstrated competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval benchmarks.

Conclusion: Dream-Coder 7B successfully demonstrates emergent any-order generation capabilities and adaptive decoding strategies for different coding tasks, providing a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches for code generation.

Abstract: We present Dream-Coder 7B, an open-source discrete diffusion language model
for code generation that exhibits emergent any-order generation capabilities.
Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly
left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based
on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms,
left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved
reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR
checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted
cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised
fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a
padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii)
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality
prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement
learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B
Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates
competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We
release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training
recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate
reproducibility and further research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes entity-aligned translation (EAT) approach using LLMs for cross-lingual NER from Latin to non-Latin script languages


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot CL-NER approaches work well for Latin script languages but degrade for non-Latin script languages due to structural differences

Method: Uses entity-aligned translation with dual-translation strategy via LLMs and fine-tunes on multilingual Wikipedia data for better entity alignment

Result: Not specified in abstract

Conclusion: EAT approach addresses cross-lingual NER challenges for non-Latin script languages through improved entity alignment

Abstract: Cross-lingual Named Entity Recognition (CL-NER) aims to transfer knowledge
from high-resource languages to low-resource languages. However, existing
zero-shot CL-NER (ZCL-NER) approaches primarily focus on Latin script language
(LSL), where shared linguistic features facilitate effective knowledge
transfer. In contrast, for non-Latin script language (NSL), such as Chinese and
Japanese, performance often degrades due to deep structural differences. To
address these challenges, we propose an entity-aligned translation (EAT)
approach. Leveraging large language models (LLMs), EAT employs a
dual-translation strategy to align entities between NSL and English. In
addition, we fine-tune LLMs using multilingual Wikipedia data to enhance the
entity alignment from source to target languages.

TL;DR: Tea-MOELoRA is a parameter-efficient multi-task framework combining LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts to handle Chinese IE tasks across different temporal domains without performance interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning a single model on heterogeneous Chinese IE tasks across Classical and Modern documents causes interference and reduced performance due to task and temporal domain differences.

Method: Combines LoRA with Mixture-of-Experts design, using multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialized for different IE tasks and eras, with a task-era-aware router for dynamic expert allocation.

Result: Outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating effective leveraging of task and temporal knowledge.

Conclusion: Tea-MOELoRA successfully addresses the challenge of multi-task learning across diverse temporal domains in Chinese IE through parameter-efficient expert specialization.

Abstract: Chinese information extraction (IE) involves multiple tasks across diverse
temporal domains, including Classical and Modern documents. Fine-tuning a
single model on heterogeneous tasks and across different eras may lead to
interference and reduced performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
Tea-MOELoRA, a parameter-efficient multi-task framework that combines LoRA with
a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Multiple low-rank LoRA experts specialize in
different IE tasks and eras, while a task-era-aware router mechanism
dynamically allocates expert contributions. Experiments show that Tea-MOELoRA
outperforms both single-task and joint LoRA baselines, demonstrating its
ability to leverage task and temporal knowledge effectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAT framework enhances LLMs for knowledge graph completion through structure-aware alignment-tuning, addressing representation space inconsistencies and unifying instructions across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-enhanced KGC methods ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures, and use separate instructions for different tasks leading to duplicate work.

Method: Hierarchical knowledge alignment to align graph embeddings with natural language space via multi-task contrastive learning, plus structural instruction tuning with unified graph instruction and lightweight knowledge adapter.

Result: SAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two KGC tasks across four datasets, with 8.7% to 29.8% improvements in link prediction.

Conclusion: The proposed SAT framework effectively addresses representation space inconsistencies and provides a unified approach for structure-aware reasoning in knowledge graph completion tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make
predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have
exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily
focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising
advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing
methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural
language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate
instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and
time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel
framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning.
Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align
graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive
learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in
performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph
instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results
on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link
prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in long-context LLM capabilities is constrained by the absence of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both training and evaluation purposes.

Method: Modular, extensible framework using prompt-based interaction with LLMs to generate synthetic long-context data. Supports multiple training objectives (SFT, DPO, GRPO) and four generation paradigms: multi-turn dialogues, document-grounded pairs, verifiable tasks, and long-context reasoning examples.

Result: The framework enables scalable, controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation through templated prompting, model-agnostic architecture, and metadata-enriched outputs.

Conclusion: This approach facilitates advancing long-context capabilities in LLMs by providing a systematic method for generating high-quality synthetic datasets that address current limitations in long-text processing and reasoning.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long

including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core
generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded
input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses interpretive ambiguity in AI systems governed by natural language principles, proposing a computational framework inspired by legal mechanisms to improve consistency in rule interpretation and application.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI systems increasingly rely on natural language principles, but face interpretive ambiguity similar to legal systems. Current alignment pipelines lack institutional safeguards that legal systems use to manage ambiguity, leading to inconsistent model behavior.

Method: Proposes a computational framework with two legal-inspired mechanisms: (1) rule refinement pipeline to minimize interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules, and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints to reduce inconsistency in rule application.

Result: Evaluated on 5,000-scenario subset of WildChat dataset, showing both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters.

Conclusion: The approach offers a systematic way to manage interpretive ambiguity, representing an essential step toward building more robust, law-following AI systems.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a
key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored:
interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how
these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems
use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent
appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines
offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can
lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we
identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems
constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We
then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a
rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising
ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative
action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce
inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide
judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of
the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve
judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach
offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an
essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing simultaneous speech translation systems struggle to balance translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, especially in multilingual scenarios with divergent read/write policies.

Method: Unsupervised policy learning framework combining prefix-based training with Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn read/write decisions implicitly, requiring minimal transformer modifications.

Result: 500M parameter model outperforms Seamless baseline with under 7% BLEU degradation at 1.5s lag and under 3% at 3s lag across 6 language pairs. Also successfully extended to streaming TTS.

Conclusion: SimulMEGA provides an effective framework for simultaneous speech translation that generalizes across modalities and achieves superior latency-quality tradeoffs without inference-time overhead.

Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) enables real-time cross-lingual
communication by jointly optimizing speech recognition and machine translation
under strict latency constraints. Existing systems struggle to balance
translation quality, latency, and semantic coherence, particularly in
multilingual many-to-many scenarios where divergent read and write policies
hinder unified strategy learning. In this paper, we present SimulMEGA
(Simultaneous Generation by Mixture-of-Experts Gating), an unsupervised policy
learning framework that combines prefix-based training with a
Mixture-of-Experts refiner to learn effective read and write decisions in an
implicit manner, without adding inference-time overhead. Our design requires
only minimal modifications to standard transformer architectures and
generalizes across both speech-to-text and text-to-speech streaming tasks.
Through comprehensive evaluation on six language pairs, our 500M parameter
speech-to-text model outperforms the Seamless baseline, achieving under 7
percent BLEU degradation at 1.5 seconds average lag and under 3 percent at 3
seconds. We further demonstrate the versatility of SimulMEGA by extending it to
streaming TTS with a unidirectional backbone, yielding superior latency quality
tradeoffs.

### [71] [Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning through Model Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01213)
*Ege Süalp,Mina Rezaei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Growth-based pretraining (Stack LLM) shows modest improvements in resisting catastrophic forgetting compared to standard LLMs, with better retention in reading comprehension and stable bias ratios, though both models still experience degradation in reasoning and comprehension over time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge in continual learning for LLMs, where models lose prior knowledge when fine-tuned on new tasks. Model growth strategies using smaller models to train larger ones show promise but their impact on forgetting remains under-explored.

Method: Evaluated growth-based pretraining via transformer stacking (Stack LLM) against a standard LLM baseline across sequential fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension, and bias evaluation.

Result: Both models improved in domain knowledge, but reasoning and reading comprehension degraded over time. Stack LLM showed less degradation, especially in reading comprehension, and maintained steady bias ratios (60-61%) while the baseline LLM became more neutral.

Conclusion: Growth-based pretraining provides modest improvements in resisting catastrophic forgetting with enhanced retention capabilities, though trade-offs exist in handling social biases and complete prevention of forgetting remains challenging.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is a significant challenge in continual learning, in
which a model loses prior knowledge when it is fine-tuned on new tasks. This
problem is particularly critical for large language models (LLMs) undergoing
continual learning, as retaining performance across diverse domains is
important for their general utility. In this paper, we explore model growth, a
promising strategy that leverages smaller models to expedite and structure the
training of larger ones for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem.
Although growth-based pretraining, particularly via transformer stacking, has
shown promise in accelerating convergence, its impact on forgetting remains
under-explored. Therefore, we evaluate whether growth-based models can retain
previously learned capabilities more effectively across a sequence of
fine-tuning tasks involving domain knowledge, reasoning, reading comprehension,
and bias. Our findings show that both models -- one trained with growth (Stack
LLM) and one without (LLM) -- exhibit improvements in domain knowledge.
However, reasoning and reading comprehension degrade over time, indicating
signs of catastrophic forgetting. Stack LLM consistently shows less
degradation, especially in reading comprehension, suggesting enhanced retention
capabilities. Interestingly, in bias evaluation, the baseline LLM becomes
progressively more neutral with continued fine-tuning, while Stack LLM
maintains a steady bias ratio around 60--61\%. These results indicate that
growth-based pretraining may deliver modest improvements in resisting
catastrophic forgetting, though trade-offs remain in handling social biases.

*Wei Huang,Huang Wei,Yinggui Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DaMoC framework helps quickly select optimal LLMs for fine-tuning by compressing data through token optimization and filtering, and compressing models via layer pruning and sparse merging, achieving 20x training time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific tasks and require fine-tuning, but selecting the best model from many open-source options is challenging and time-consuming.

Method: Two-level approach: 1) Data compression through systematic data filtering (distribution/quality/hybrid methods), token compression, and iterative text rewriting; 2) Model compression using layer similarity scoring for pruning and sparse merging to preserve capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments on medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general Q&A, and reading comprehension datasets show the framework can select optimal LLMs while saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

Conclusion: DaMoC provides an effective framework for rapid LLM selection and fine-tuning optimization through combined data and model compression techniques.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many
open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream
tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal
LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses
this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering
methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three
distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,
and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the
density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we
use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model
Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and
remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging
paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.
Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general
Q&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while
saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

*Hao Yang,Zhiyu Yang,Yunjie Zhang,Shanyi Zhu,Lin Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates the working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, examining how models balance pretrained knowledge with in-context learning through lexical analysis, noise introduction, and prompt engineering experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the growing popularity of Chain-of-Thought reasoning for enhancing model inference, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear, prompting this investigation into how models actually perform reasoning.

Method: The researchers conducted fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales, incrementally introduced noisy exemplars to test model robustness, and investigated prompt engineering techniques to induce slow thinking in LLMs.

Result: Three key findings: (1) Models quickly learn reasoning structures but heavily rely on pretrained priors; (2) Sufficient exemplars shift decision-making to in-context signals while misleading prompts cause instability; (3) Long Chain-of-Thought prompting improves downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought reasoning involves a dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors, with prompt engineering capable of inducing more deliberate reasoning processes that enhance model performance.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing
model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought
reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the
working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the
dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first
conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the
model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars,
we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous
in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can
induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning
structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning
patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient
exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to
in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long
Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning
chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

### [74] [Annotation and modeling of emotions in a textual corpus: an evaluative approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01260)
*Jonas Noblet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper demonstrates that language models can effectively model emotion labeling processes and identify underlying linguistic features driving annotation variability in emotionally annotated text corpora.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotion analysis in text remains challenging with significant annotation disagreements. The authors aim to show that despite this variability, stable statistical patterns exist and language models can capture the evaluative criteria used in emotion annotation.

Method: Used language models trained on manually annotated industrial corpus following an evaluative approach to emotion. Analyzed annotation disagreements and modeled the labeling process to identify linguistic features driving variability.

Result: Language models successfully modeled the labeling process and showed that annotation variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Models demonstrated capability to distinguish emotional situations based on evaluative criteria.

Conclusion: The evaluative approach to emotion annotation, though underutilized, provides valuable insights. Language models can effectively capture and model the complex process of emotion labeling, offering a complementary perspective to traditional emotion analysis methods.

Abstract: Emotion is a crucial phenomenon in the functioning of human beings in
society. However, it remains a widely open subject, particularly in its textual
manifestations. This paper examines an industrial corpus manually annotated
following an evaluative approach to emotion. This theoretical framework, which
is currently underutilized, offers a different perspective that complements
traditional approaches. Noting that the annotations we collected exhibit
significant disagreement, we hypothesized that they nonetheless follow stable
statistical trends. Using language models trained on these annotations, we
demonstrate that it is possible to model the labeling process and that
variability is driven by underlying linguistic features. Conversely, our
results indicate that language models seem capable of distinguishing emotional
situations based on evaluative criteria.

*Juhyun Oh,Inha Cha,Michael Saxon,Hyunseung Lim,Shaily Bhatt,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current cultural evaluation methods for LLMs are inadequate as they treat culture as static trivia. The paper proposes intentional cultural evaluation that examines cultural assumptions in all aspects of evaluation, not just explicitly cultural tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches reduce culture to static facts or values through multiple-choice questions, neglecting the pluralistic and interactive nature of culture and overlooking how cultural assumptions permeate even "neutral" evaluation settings.

Method: The paper systematically characterizes what, how, and when culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, emphasizing researcher positionality and proposing HCI-inspired participatory methodologies for involving communities in evaluation design.

Result: The position paper argues for a paradigm shift from trivia-centered evaluation to intentional cultural evaluation that examines embedded cultural assumptions throughout the evaluation process.

Conclusion: The paper calls for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering unknown important applications, and fostering inclusive, culturally aligned NLP research through community involvement and participatory design approaches.

Abstract: The prevailing ``trivia-centered paradigm'' for evaluating the cultural
alignment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly inadequate as these
models become more advanced and widely deployed. Existing approaches typically
reduce culture to static facts or values, testing models via multiple-choice or
short-answer questions that treat culture as isolated trivia. Such methods
neglect the pluralistic and interactive realities of culture, and overlook how
cultural assumptions permeate even ostensibly ``neutral'' evaluation settings.
In this position paper, we argue for \textbf{intentionally cultural
evaluation}: an approach that systematically examines the cultural assumptions
embedded in all aspects of evaluation, not just in explicitly cultural tasks.
We systematically characterize the what, how, and circumstances by which
culturally contingent considerations arise in evaluation, and emphasize the
importance of researcher positionality for fostering inclusive, culturally
aligned NLP research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions
for moving beyond current benchmarking practices, discovering important
applications that we don't know exist, and involving communities in evaluation
design through HCI-inspired participatory methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableZoomer is an LLM-powered agent framework that addresses table QA challenges through structured schema representation, query-aware table zooming, and Program-of-Thoughts execution to improve accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges in industrial table QA applications including structural heterogeneity, target data localization difficulties, and complex reasoning bottlenecks that limit their practical deployment.

Method: Proposes TableZoomer with three innovations: (1) structured table schema instead of verbalized tables, (2) query-aware table zooming mechanism for dynamic sub-table generation, and (3) Program-of-Thoughts strategy to transform queries into executable code. Integrates with ReAct paradigm for iterative reasoning.

Result: Achieves 19.34% accuracy improvement on DataBench dataset and 25% improvement on TableBench Fact Checking task compared to conventional PoT methods when implemented with Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM.

Conclusion: TableZoomer framework maintains usability advantages while significantly enhancing performance and scalability across tables of varying scales, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing industrial table QA challenges.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in the table question
answering (TQA) task through prompt engineering, they face challenges in
industrial applications, including structural heterogeneity, difficulties in
target data localization, and bottlenecks in complex reasoning. To address
these limitations, this paper presents TableZoomer, a novel LLM-powered,
programming-based agent framework. It introduces three key innovations: (1)
replacing the original fully verbalized table with structured table schema to
bridge the semantic gap and reduce computational complexity; (2) a query-aware
table zooming mechanism that dynamically generates sub-table schema through
column selection and entity linking, significantly improving target
localization efficiency; and (3) a Program-of-Thoughts (PoT) strategy that
transforms queries into executable code to mitigate numerical hallucination.
Additionally, we integrate the reasoning workflow with the ReAct paradigm to
enable iterative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework maintains the usability advantages while substantially enhancing
performance and scalability across tables of varying scales. When implemented
with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct LLM, TableZoomer achieves accuracy improvements of
19.34% and 25% over conventional PoT methods on the large-scale DataBench
dataset and the small-scale Fact Checking task of TableBench dataset,
respectively.

### [77] [Can Smaller LLMs do better? Unlocking Cross-Domain Potential through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Text Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01314)
*Anum Afzal,Mehul Kumawat,Florian Matthes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques enable LLMs to adapt to low-resource domains without full retraining, achieving better performance than few-shot learning and larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain adaptation to low-resource areas where labeled data is scarce, and full fine-tuning is computationally expensive.

Method: Benchmarked six PEFT techniques on Llama-3-8B-Instruct using 14 datasets across Scientific, Medical, Legal, and News domains for text summarization, exploring within-domain and cross-domain adapters.

Result: Within-domain adapters outperformed few-shot learning and larger Llama-3-70B-Instruct models. Cross-domain adapters and strategic adapter combinations leveraged linguistic similarities for better low-resource performance.

Conclusion: PEFT techniques provide efficient domain adaptation for LLMs in low-resource settings, with both within-domain and cross-domain adapters offering significant performance improvements over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), being generic task solvers, are versatile.
However, despite the vast amount of data they are trained on, there are
speculations about their adaptation capabilities to a new domain. Additionally,
the simple fine-tuning of the model to incorporate knowledge of a new domain is
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This becomes more challenging
when the domain in question is also low-resource, and labeled data is
unavailable. We leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques (PEFTs) on
high-resource datasets to address these challenges to improve performance on
unseen low-resource domains. Throughout our experiments, we evaluate whether
intrinsic linguistic commonalities between datasets can be leveraged for
efficient domain adaptation. We benchmark six PEFTs with
\texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} on 14 training datasets from the Scientific,
Medical, Legal, and News domains for a Text Summarization task. Our experiments
show that for low-resource domains, inference using Within-Domain Adapters can
achieve better performance than Few-Shot as well as a much larger
\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}. Lastly, in the absence of Within-Domain
Adapters, we explore the concept of using Cross-Domain Adapters as well as the
strategic combinations of adapters to leverage intrinsic language similarities
across domains, facilitating better adaptability and performance in
low-resource settings.

TL;DR: LongCat-Flash is a 560B parameter MoE language model with novel Zero-computation Experts and Shortcut-connected MoE designs for computational efficiency, achieving 100+ TPS inference at $0.70 per million tokens and competitive performance in agentic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for scalable efficiency in large language models by optimizing computational budget allocation and improving inference throughput while maintaining advanced agentic capabilities.

Method: Uses Mixture-of-Experts architecture with two novel designs: Zero-computation Experts for dynamic computational allocation (18.6B-31.3B params per token) and Shortcut-connected MoE for computation-communication overlap. Includes comprehensive scaling framework with hyperparameter transfer, model-growth initialization, and stability suite.

Result: Trained on 20+ trillion tokens in 30 days, achieves over 100 tokens per second inference at $0.70 per million output tokens. Delivers competitive performance among leading models with exceptional strengths in agentic tasks.

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash successfully combines computational efficiency with advanced capabilities through novel architectural designs, making large-scale model training and inference more practical while maintaining strong performance, particularly in agentic applications.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic
capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash
adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic
computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per
token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b)
Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap
window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput
compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling
framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth
initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation
to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy
among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete
model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving
over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million
output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we
conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted
mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further
augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers
highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional
strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is
open-sourced to foster community research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KoBLEX is a Korean legal QA benchmark for evaluating provision-grounded multi-hop reasoning, with ParSeR method achieving significant performance improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing legal benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded question answering, requiring a specialized benchmark for Korean legal reasoning.

Method: Created KoBLEX benchmark with 226 scenario-based QA instances using LLM-human expert pipeline. Proposed ParSeR method with parametric provisions and three-stage retrieval for legal reasoning.

Result: ParSeR outperforms strong baselines, achieving +37.91 higher F1 and +30.81 higher LF-Eval compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The proposed KoBLEX benchmark and ParSeR method effectively address provision-grounded legal QA, with LF-Eval metric showing high correlation with human judgments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performances in general
domains and are now extending into the expert domain of law. Several benchmarks
have been proposed to evaluate LLMs' legal capabilities. However, these
benchmarks fail to evaluate open-ended and provision-grounded Question
Answering (QA). To address this, we introduce a Korean Benchmark for Legal
EXplainable QA (KoBLEX), designed to evaluate provision-grounded, multi-hop
legal reasoning. KoBLEX includes 226 scenario-based QA instances and their
supporting provisions, created using a hybrid LLM-human expert pipeline. We
also propose a method called Parametric provision-guided Selection Retrieval
(ParSeR), which uses LLM-generated parametric provisions to guide legally
grounded and reliable answers. ParSeR facilitates multi-hop reasoning on
complex legal questions by generating parametric provisions and employing a
three-stage sequential retrieval process. Furthermore, to better evaluate the
legal fidelity of the generated answers, we propose Legal Fidelity Evaluation
(LF-Eval). LF-Eval is an automatic metric that jointly considers the question,
answer, and supporting provisions and shows a high correlation with human
judgments. Experimental results show that ParSeR consistently outperforms
strong baselines, achieving the best results across multiple LLMs. Notably,
compared to standard retrieval with GPT-4o, ParSeR achieves +37.91 higher F1
and +30.81 higher LF-Eval. Further analyses reveal that ParSeR efficiently
delivers consistent performance across reasoning depths, with ablations
confirming the effectiveness of ParSeR.

TL;DR: LLMs can master complex card games through fine-tuning on gameplay data, achieving near-AI performance levels while handling multiple games simultaneously, though with some general capability tradeoffs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether large language models can achieve similar success in complex games as specialized AI systems like AlphaGo, particularly in the domain of card games.

Method: Systematic assessment of LLMs across eight diverse card games through fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data, evaluating performance impact and general capability retention.

Result: LLMs approach strong game AI performance through supervised fine-tuning, can master multiple games simultaneously with performance benefits for similar games, but experience general capability decline that can be mitigated with general instruction data.

Conclusion: LLMs demonstrate strong learning ability and versatility in complex card games, showing potential for game mastery while highlighting the need to balance specialized training with general capability preservation.

Abstract: Complex games have long been an important benchmark for testing the progress
of artificial intelligence algorithms. AlphaGo, AlphaZero, and MuZero have
defeated top human players in Go and Chess, garnering widespread societal
attention towards artificial intelligence. Concurrently, large language models
(LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various tasks, raising the
question of whether LLMs can achieve similar success in complex games. In this
paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in mastering complex card games. We
systematically assess the learning capabilities of LLMs across eight diverse
card games, evaluating the impact of fine-tuning on high-quality gameplay data,
and examining the models' ability to retain general capabilities while
mastering these games. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can approach the
performance of strong game AIs through supervised fine-tuning on high-quality
data, (2) LLMs can master multiple complex card games simultaneously, with
performance augmentation for games with similar rules and conflicts for
dissimilar ones, and (3) LLMs experience a decline in general capabilities when
mastering complex games, but this decline can be mitigated by integrating a
certain amount of general instruction data. The evaluation results demonstrate
strong learning ability and versatility of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reasoning capabilities can be extracted as compact task vectors from fine-tuned models and transferred to other models through simple arithmetic operations, improving performance on reasoning benchmarks without costly retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often require expensive optimization like reinforcement learning to master complex reasoning tasks. This work aims to demonstrate that reasoning ability can be extracted and transferred between models as a compact vector, reducing the need for costly retraining.

Method: Extract a reasoning vector v_reason = θ_GRPO - θ_SFT from two identically initialized Qwen2.5 models (one fine-tuned with SFT, the other with GRPO on the same dataset). This vector is hypothesized to capture reasoning capability from reinforcement learning while factoring out shared SFT knowledge. The vector is then added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple arithmetic.

Result: The reasoning vector consistently improves performance across diverse benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and BigBenchHard (+12.3% for 1.5B model). Performance improvements persist under adversarial conditions. Subtracting the vector causes significant degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating its strong contribution to reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities developed through expensive training can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by recycling prior computational investments.

Abstract: Large language models often require costly optimization, such as
reinforcement learning, to master complex reasoning tasks. This work
demonstrates that reasoning ability, once learned, can be extracted and
transferred between models as a compact task vector. We source two publicly
available, identically initialized Qwen2.5 models, one fine-tuned with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and the other with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) on the same dataset. From these, we extract a reasoning
vector: $v_{\text{reason}} = \theta_{\text{GRPO}} - \theta_{\text{SFT}}$. We
hypothesize that this vector captures the reasoning capability instilled by
reinforcement learning while factoring out shared knowledge from the SFT
process. When added to compatible instruction-tuned models through simple
arithmetic, this vector consistently improves performance across diverse
reasoning benchmarks: GSM8K (+4.9%), HumanEval (+4.3%), SciQ (+1.7%), and
BigBenchHard (+12.3% for the 1.5B model). The performance improvements persist
under adversarial conditions. Conversely, subtracting the vector causes
significant performance degradation (-11.8% on GSM8K), demonstrating the
vector's strong contribution to the model's reasoning abilities. This work
shows how reasoning capabilities, typically developed through expensive
training, can be extracted from existing open-source models and reused through
simple tensor arithmetic, offering a practical way to enhance models by
recycling prior computational investments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Online harms like hate speech threaten user safety and platform trust. There's a need for tools that combine automated speed with human judgment while providing clear explanations for decisions.

Method: Built as an AI agent system using Large Language Models with specialized tools: BERT-based classifier for flagging harmful content, comparison with hate speech examples, Urban Dictionary for slang lookup, chain-of-thought reasoning generation, and platform guideline checking.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with a macro F1 score of 0.91, surpassing existing methods in hate speech detection.

Conclusion: WATCHED effectively supports human moderators by providing AI-assisted hate speech detection with transparent explanations, facilitating collaboration between AI and human oversight to reduce online harms.

Abstract: Online harms are a growing problem in digital spaces, putting user safety at
risk and reducing trust in social media platforms. One of the most persistent
forms of harm is hate speech. To address this, we need tools that combine the
speed and scale of automated systems with the judgment and insight of human
moderators. These tools should not only find harmful content but also explain
their decisions clearly, helping to build trust and understanding. In this
paper, we present WATCHED, a chatbot designed to support content moderators in
tackling hate speech. The chatbot is built as an Artificial Intelligence Agent
system that uses Large Language Models along with several specialised tools. It
compares new posts with real examples of hate speech and neutral content, uses
a BERT-based classifier to help flag harmful messages, looks up slang and
informal language using sources like Urban Dictionary, generates
chain-of-thought reasoning, and checks platform guidelines to explain and
support its decisions. This combination allows the chatbot not only to detect
hate speech but to explain why content is considered harmful, grounded in both
precedent and policy. Experimental results show that our proposed method
surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, reaching a macro F1 score of 0.91.
Designed for moderators, safety teams, and researchers, the tool helps reduce
online harms by supporting collaboration between AI and human oversight.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets for cross-document relations limits automated assistance development.

Method: Domain-agnostic framework: generate semi-synthetic interconnected documents, perform automatic evaluation to shortlist best approaches, then conduct extensive human evaluation on natural text pairs.

Result: Combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78% human approval rate for links, more than doubling precision of retrievers alone in peer review and news domains.

Conclusion: Framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding and provides foundation for cross-document tasks; code, data, and protocols are openly available.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained relations between documents is crucial for many
application domains. However, the study of automated assistance is limited by
the lack of efficient methods to create training and evaluation datasets of
cross-document links. To address this, we introduce a new domain-agnostic
framework for selecting a best-performing approach and annotating
cross-document links in a new domain from scratch. We first generate and
validate semi-synthetic datasets of interconnected documents. This data is used
to perform automatic evaluation, producing a shortlist of best-performing
linking approaches. These approaches are then used in an extensive human
evaluation study, yielding performance estimates on natural text pairs. We
apply our framework in two distinct domains -- peer review and news -- and show
that combining retrieval models with LLMs achieves 78\% link approval from
human raters, more than doubling the precision of strong retrievers alone. Our
framework enables systematic study of cross-document understanding across
application scenarios, and the resulting novel datasets lay foundation for
numerous cross-document tasks like media framing and peer review. We make the
code, data, and annotation protocols openly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the statistical and linguistic properties of neural audio codec tokens and how they relate to speech synthesis quality and intelligibility.

Method: Comparative analysis of NAC tokens examining adherence to linguistic statistical laws (Zipf's, Heaps'), entropy, redundancy, and evaluation using ASR error rates and UTMOS scores for quality assessment.

Result: NAC tokens, especially 3-grams, exhibit language-like statistical patterns, and these properties correlate with improved performance in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into NAC token sequence structure and can inform the design of more effective generative speech models.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of the statistical and linguistic
properties of neural audio codecs (NACs). We investigate discrete speech tokens
produced by various NAC models, examining their adherence to linguistic
statistical laws such as Zipf's law and Heaps' law, as well as their entropy
and redundancy. To assess how these token-level properties relate to semantic
and acoustic preservation in synthesized speech, we evaluate intelligibility
using error rates of automatic speech recognition, and quality using the UTMOS
score. Our results reveal that NAC tokens, particularly 3-grams, exhibit
language-like statistical patterns. Moreover, these properties, together with
measures of information content, are found to correlate with improved
performances in speech recognition and resynthesis tasks. These findings offer
insights into the structure of NAC token sequences and inform the design of
more effective generative speech models.

Motivation: Large language models perform well on math problems but fail at meta-reasoning tasks like identifying errors in student stepwise solutions, even with reference solutions available.

Result: Experiments on VtG and PRM800K datasets show state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with error step localization, but the proposed intermediate correction method helps improve performance.

Conclusion: Generating intermediate corrected solutions that better match student reasoning patterns can enhance LLMs' ability to locate the first error step in mathematical problem-solving sequences.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word
problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such
as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the
challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two
error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that
state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student
solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we
propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution,
aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Vis-CoT is an interactive framework that converts chain-of-thought reasoning into visual graphs, allowing human intervention to improve LLM reasoning accuracy and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought prompting in LLMs is opaque and difficult to verify, debug, and control in high-stakes settings, making human oversight necessary.

Method: Converts linear CoT text into interactive reasoning graphs where users can visualize logical flow, identify flawed steps, prune incorrect paths, and graft new user-defined premises.

Result: Improves final-answer accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines on GSM8K and StrategyQA, with large gains in perceived usability and trust.

Conclusion: Vis-CoT provides a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong reasoning via chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting, but the process is opaque, which makes verification, debugging, and
control difficult in high-stakes settings. We present Vis-CoT, a
human-in-the-loop framework that converts linear CoT text into an interactive
reasoning graph. Users can visualize the logical flow, identify flawed steps,
and intervene by pruning incorrect paths and grafting new, user-defined
premises. This shifts interaction from passive observation to active
collaboration, steering models toward more accurate and trustworthy
conclusions. Across GSM8K and StrategyQA, Vis-CoT improves final-answer
accuracy by up to 24 percentage points over non-interactive baselines. A user
study also shows large gains in perceived usability and trust. Vis-CoT points
to a practical path for more reliable, understandable, and collaborative
reasoning by combining LLMs with targeted human oversight.

### [87] [On the Alignment of Large Language Models with Global Human Opinion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01418)
*Yang Liu,Masahiro Kaneko,Chenhui Chu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show inconsistent opinion alignment across countries and historical periods, with language-based prompting being an effective steering method for better country-specific alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies on LLM opinion alignment focus mainly on US demographics and lack global country samples, historical period analysis, and investigation of language influence on opinion steering.

Method: Created an evaluation framework using World Values Survey (WVS) to systematically assess LLM opinion alignment across different countries, languages, and historical periods worldwide.

Result: LLMs appropriately or over-align with only a few countries while under-aligning with most countries. Changing prompt language to match questionnaire language effectively steers LLMs to better align with corresponding country opinions. LLMs show better alignment with contemporary populations.

Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive investigation of LLM opinion alignment across global, language, and temporal dimensions, revealing significant alignment disparities and demonstrating language as an effective steering mechanism.

Abstract: Today's large language models (LLMs) are capable of supporting multilingual
scenarios, allowing users to interact with LLMs in their native languages. When
LLMs respond to subjective questions posed by users, they are expected to align
with the views of specific demographic groups or historical periods, shaped by
the language in which the user interacts with the model. Existing studies
mainly focus on researching the opinions represented by LLMs among demographic
groups in the United States or a few countries, lacking worldwide country
samples and studies on human opinions in different historical periods, as well
as lacking discussion on using language to steer LLMs. Moreover, they also
overlook the potential influence of prompt language on the alignment of LLMs'
opinions. In this study, our goal is to fill these gaps. To this end, we create
an evaluation framework based on the World Values Survey (WVS) to
systematically assess the alignment of LLMs with human opinions across
different countries, languages, and historical periods around the world. We
find that LLMs appropriately or over-align the opinions with only a few
countries while under-aligning the opinions with most countries. Furthermore,
changing the language of the prompt to match the language used in the
questionnaire can effectively steer LLMs to align with the opinions of the
corresponding country more effectively than existing steering methods. At the
same time, LLMs are more aligned with the opinions of the contemporary
population. To our knowledge, our study is the first comprehensive
investigation of the topic of opinion alignment in LLMs across global,
language, and temporal dimensions. Our code and data are publicly available at

*Markus Oehri,Giulia Conti,Kaviraj Pather,Alexandre Rossi,Laia Serra,Adrian Parody,Rogvi Johannesen,Aviaja Petersen,Arben Krasniqi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniCR is a unified framework that converts various uncertainty evidence into calibrated correctness probabilities and enforces user-specified error budgets through principled refusal mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models need to know when not to answer to maintain trustworthiness, requiring a systematic approach to handle uncertainty from multiple sources and provide calibrated refusal decisions.

Method: Learns lightweight calibration head with temperature scaling and proper scoring, uses black-box features for API-only models, employs conformal risk control for distribution-free guarantees, and aligns confidence with semantic fidelity using atomic factuality scores for long-form generation.

Result: Consistent improvements in calibration metrics, lower area under risk-coverage curve, higher coverage at fixed risk compared to baseline methods across short-form QA, code generation, and retrieval-augmented long-form QA tasks.

Conclusion: UniCR provides a portable evidence-to-probability-to-decision framework that improves model trustworthiness without fine-tuning base models and remains valid under distribution shift, with evidence contradiction, semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency being key abstention drivers.

Abstract: Deployed language models must decide not only what to answer but also when
not to answer. We present UniCR, a unified framework that turns heterogeneous
uncertainty evidence including sequence likelihoods, self-consistency
dispersion, retrieval compatibility, and tool or verifier feedback into a
calibrated probability of correctness and then enforces a user-specified error
budget via principled refusal. UniCR learns a lightweight calibration head with
temperature scaling and proper scoring, supports API-only models through
black-box features, and offers distribution-free guarantees using conformal
risk control. For long-form generation, we align confidence with semantic
fidelity by supervising on atomic factuality scores derived from retrieved
evidence, reducing confident hallucinations while preserving coverage.
Experiments on short-form QA, code generation with execution tests, and
retrieval-augmented long-form QA show consistent improvements in calibration
metrics, lower area under the risk-coverage curve, and higher coverage at fixed
risk compared to entropy or logit thresholds, post-hoc calibrators, and
end-to-end selective baselines. Analyses reveal that evidence contradiction,
semantic dispersion, and tool inconsistency are the dominant drivers of
abstention, yielding informative user-facing refusal messages. The result is a
portable recipe of evidence fusion to calibrated probability to risk-controlled
decision that improves trustworthiness without fine-tuning the base model and
remains valid under distribution shift.

*Yuchen Wu,Liang Ding,Li Shen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Reason-KE is a reasoning-chain-based knowledge editing framework that enables efficient and reliable updates to LLMs without full retraining, achieving 90.2% multi-hop QA accuracy with strong noise resilience.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs remain static after training, making timely integration of emerging facts expensive. Existing knowledge editing methods either rely on superficial cues or have complex pipelines that fail under noisy, multi-hop conditions.

Method: End-to-end reasoning-chain framework with four structured stages: fact acknowledgment, relevance determination, selective application, and final reasoning. Trained on MQuAKE-CF dataset with up to four irrelevant facts to filter distractors in a single pass.

Result: Achieved 90.2% multi-hop QA accuracy on Qwen2.5-7B, with only 6.3% drop under heavy distraction and <1% drop when answers are leaked. Quantitative analysis confirms resilience and efficiency.

Conclusion: Reason-KE establishes a new state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates, demonstrating superior performance in handling noisy, multi-hop conditions through structured reasoning chains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of world knowledge but
remain static once trained, making the timely integration of emerging facts
prohibitively expensive via full retraining. Knowledge-editing techniques have
thus emerged to inject or overwrite specific facts into LLMs, yet they either
over-rely on superficial cues or incur complex, iterative pipelines that
collapse under noisy, multi-hop conditions. We introduce Reason-KE, an
end-to-end reasoning-chain-based editing framework that steers a pretrained LLM
through four structured stages-fact acknowledgment, relevance determination,
selective application, and final reasoning-to filter distractors in a single
pass. Trained on MQuAKE-CF with up to four irrelevant facts, Reason-KE elevates
Qwen2.5-7B's multi-hop QA accuracy to 90.2% while suffering merely a 6.3% drop
under heavy distraction and <1% when answers are leaked. Our quantitative
analysis confirms Reason-KE's resilience and efficiency, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for reliable LLM knowledge updates.

*Youchao Zhou,Heyan Huang,Yicheng Liu,Rui Dai,Xinglin Wang,Xingchen Zhang,Shumin Shi,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) can properly refuse to answer when they lack knowledge, finding they exhibit significant over-refusal behavior and exploring methods to mitigate this issue while maintaining answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research focuses on individual effectiveness of RALMs and refusal post-training but overlooks evaluating RALMs' refusal capability, particularly whether they know when they don't know.

Method: The study examines RALM calibration across different knowledge states, investigates Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods, and develops a simple refusal method for refusal post-trained models.

Result: LLMs show significant over-refusal behavior; In-context fine-tuning mitigates over-refusal while R-tuning magnifies it; refusal ability may conflict with answer quality; a simple refusal method improves overall answer quality.

Conclusion: The study provides comprehensive understanding of factors influencing RALM systems, revealing over-refusal issues and offering solutions to balance refusal capability with answer quality.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet
factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are
primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval
Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current
research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while
overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study,
we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know?
Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated
regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the
influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs
exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal
post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware
Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that
the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified
by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with
the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal
method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality
in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more
comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM
systems.

*Andreas Ottem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeVe introduces a modular 5-phase architecture for RAG systems that verifies information before context composition, achieving 57-75% context reduction while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG systems suffer from irrelevant/redundant information due to simple top-k semantic search, degrading performance and efficiency.

Method: Five-phase modular design: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval, context prioritization, and token budgeting for fine-grained control.

Result: 57% context reduction on Wikipedia dataset and 75% reduction on HotpotQA dataset compared to standard RAG, with improved efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: MeVe provides a scalable framework for reliable LLM applications through refined context distillation, enabling better grounding and factual support.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints
because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The
approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant
information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This
paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory
Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by
proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval
and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently
tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval,
context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables
fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling
task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation
of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy
QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that
by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly
improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset
and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard
RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and
reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information,
MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support
[16].

*Thomas Compton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of community unionism in 1920s National Boot & Shoe Union vs 2010s-2020s Unite Community using NLP techniques, revealing divergent engagement models despite both engaging with community themes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine how community unionism discourse differs across historical periods and organizational contexts, and to assess the continuity of CU features like coalition-building and grassroots engagement over time.

Method: Used BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting alongside word frequency analysis to analyze union discourse from archival materials and contemporary sources.

Result: Significant differences found: Unite Community shows strong alignment with outward-facing social justice themes, while B&S Union focused on internal administration and traditional servicing model. Modern NLP techniques proved effective for historical labor archive analysis.

Conclusion: Both unions engage with community themes but have fundamentally different models of engagement, challenging assumptions about continuity and universality of community unionism across time and sectors.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of community unionism (CU) in two
distinct historical and organizational contexts: the National Boot and Shoe
Union (B\&S) in the 1920s and Unite Community in the 2010s--2020s. Using
BERTopic for thematic modeling and cTF-IDF weighting, alongside word frequency
analysis, the study examines the extent to which each union's discourse aligns
with key features of CU -- such as coalition-building, grassroots engagement,
and action beyond the workplace. The results reveal significant differences in
thematic focus and discursive coherence. While Unite Community demonstrates
stronger alignment with outward-facing, social justice-oriented themes, the
B\&S corpus emphasizes internal administration, industrial relations, and
member services -- reflecting a more traditional, servicing-oriented union
model. The analysis also highlights methodological insights, demonstrating how
modern NLP techniques can enhance the study of historical labor archives.
Ultimately, the findings suggest that while both unions engage with
community-related themes, their underlying models of engagement diverge
significantly, challenging assumptions about the continuity and universality of
community unionism across time and sector.

### [93] [CAT: Causal Attention Tuning For Injecting Fine-grained Causal Knowledge into Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01535)
*Kairong Han,Wenshuo Zhao,Ziyu Zhao,JunJian Ye,Lujia Pan,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs often capture spurious correlations instead of true causal relationships, leading to poor OOD performance. The paper proposes Causal Attention Tuning (CAT) to inject fine-grained causal knowledge into attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained on large-scale data frequently learn spurious correlations rather than genuine causal relationships, resulting in suboptimal performance particularly in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Method: Proposes Causal Attention Tuning (CAT) with an automated pipeline that generates token-level causal signals using human priors, and introduces Re-Attention mechanism to guide training and focus on causal structures while reducing attention noise and biases.

Result: Experimental results on the proposed Spurious Token Game benchmark and multiple downstream tasks show that CAT effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and maintains robustness in OOD scenarios.

Conclusion: The CAT approach successfully addresses the limitation of LLMs in capturing causal relationships, enabling more robust performance through attention mechanism enhancements with causal knowledge injection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize
causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we
find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious
correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal
performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that
injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose
an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate
token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide
training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise
and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious
Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our
approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains
robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at

TL;DR: In-N-Out dataset converts API documentation into structured API graphs to help tool agents better handle complex multi-tool queries requiring compositional API calls, nearly doubling performance compared to using documentation alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tool agents struggle with complex tasks requiring proper API identification and sequencing. Current approaches using raw API documentation are insufficient for handling compositional API calls in multi-tool queries.

Method: Convert API documentation into structured API graphs capturing API dependencies. Create In-N-Out dataset with expert-annotated API graphs from real-world API benchmarks. Use this for tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation.

Result: Significant performance improvement on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation (nearly double that of LLMs using documentation alone). Models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of the performance gap.

Conclusion: Explicit API graphs show promise for tool agents. In-N-Out dataset is a valuable resource that helps models learn API documentation comprehension and parameter relationships. Dataset and code will be publicly released.

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a
way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex,
these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper
order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into
a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for
multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we
introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from
two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out
significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query
generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover,
graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap,
showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and
parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit
API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource.
We will release the dataset and code publicly.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EAGLE is a novel self-evaluation calibration method that uses internal hidden states from multiple intermediate layers to improve LLM confidence scoring and reduce overconfidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often exhibit overconfidence and generate plausible but incorrect answers, especially after RLHF training, creating challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment.

Method: Extracts internal beliefs from multiple intermediate layers during self-evaluation, aggregates layer-wise beliefs, and calculates expectation over confidence score distribution to produce refined confidence scores.

Result: Extensive experiments show EAGLE significantly improves calibration performance over existing baselines across diverse datasets and LLMs.

Conclusion: EAGLE effectively leverages internal model states to provide more accurate confidence estimation, addressing LLM overconfidence issues for safer deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, but often exhibit overconfidence and generate
plausible yet incorrect answers. This overconfidence, especially in models
undergone Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), poses significant
challenges for reliable uncertainty estimation and safe deployment. In this
paper, we propose EAGLE (Expectation of AGgregated internaL bEief), a novel
self-evaluation-based calibration method that leverages the internal hidden
states of LLMs to derive more accurate confidence scores. Instead of relying on
the model's final output, our approach extracts internal beliefs from multiple
intermediate layers during self-evaluation. By aggregating these layer-wise
beliefs and calculating the expectation over the resulting confidence score
distribution, EAGLE produces a refined confidence score that more faithfully
reflects the model's internal certainty. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets and LLMs demonstrate that EAGLE significantly improves calibration
performance over existing baselines. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
EAGLE, including a layer-wise examination of uncertainty patterns, a study of
the impact of self-evaluation prompts, and an analysis of the effect of
self-evaluation score range.

### [96] [Testing the assumptions about the geometry of sentence embedding spaces: the cosine measure need not apply](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01606)
*Vivi Nastase,Paola Merlo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sentence embeddings' geometric closeness in transformer space does not predict performance on linguistic tasks, as cosine similarity captures only shallow commonalities rather than meaningful task-specific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the geometric properties of sentence embeddings (like closeness in embedding space) correlate with their performance on linguistic tasks, given that this relationship holds for word embeddings.

Method: Computed sentence embeddings using three approaches: averaged token embeddings, [CLS] token embeddings, and random token embeddings. Analyzed correlation between embedding distances and performance on various linguistic tasks.

Result: Cosine similarity captures only shallow commonalities between sentence embeddings and is not predictive of task performance. Linguistic information is encoded in weighted dimension combinations not reflected in embedding space geometry.

Conclusion: The geometry of sentence embedding space is not a reliable indicator of performance on linguistic tasks, as meaningful information is encoded in complex dimension interactions rather than simple spatial proximity.

Abstract: Transformer models learn to encode and decode an input text, and produce
contextual token embeddings as a side-effect. The mapping from language into
the embedding space maps words expressing similar concepts onto points that are
close in the space. In practice, the reverse implication is also assumed: words
corresponding to close points in this space are similar or related, those that
are further are not.
  Does closeness in the embedding space extend to shared properties for
sentence embeddings? We present an investigation of sentence embeddings and
show that the geometry of their embedding space is not predictive of their
relative performances on a variety of tasks.
  We compute sentence embeddings in three ways: as averaged token embeddings,
as the embedding of the special [CLS] token, and as the embedding of a random
token from the sentence. We explore whether there is a correlation between the
distance between sentence embedding variations and their performance on
linguistic tasks, and whether despite their distances, they do encode the same
information in the same manner.
  The results show that the cosine similarity -- which treats dimensions
shallowly -- captures (shallow) commonalities or differences between sentence
embeddings, which are not predictive of their performance on specific tasks.
Linguistic information is rather encoded in weighted combinations of different
dimensions, which are not reflected in the geometry of the sentence embedding
space.

*Shanshan Wang,Junchao Wu,Fengying Ye,Jingming Yao,Lidia S. Chao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new benchmark for detecting AI-generated modern Chinese poetry shows current detectors fail to reliably identify LLM-created poems, with style being the most challenging feature to detect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry is disrupting the poetry ecosystem, and existing detection methods don't address the distinctive characteristics of this poetic form, creating an urgent need for specialized detection tools.

Method: Constructed a high-quality dataset with 800 human-written poems from professional poets and 41,600 AI-generated poems from four mainstream LLMs, then systematically evaluated six detectors on this dataset.

Result: Current detectors cannot reliably detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs, with intrinsic qualities (especially style) being the most difficult poetic features to detect.

Conclusion: The proposed benchmark is effective and necessary, laying a foundation for future detection of AI-generated poetry and highlighting the limitations of current detection methods for this specific domain.

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made
AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on
detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved
modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese
poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or
AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly
disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying
AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel
benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first
construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six
professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs.
Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on
this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be
used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The
most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially
style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our
proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of
AI-generated poetry.

TL;DR: TransGAT combines fine-tuned Transformers with Graph Attention Networks for automated essay scoring, achieving superior performance with 0.854 QWK score on analytic scoring dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual essay scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent, while current AES approaches use static word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning and often overlook specific writing aspects in holistic scoring.

Method: Two-stream approach pairing fine-tuned Transformers (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTaV3) with separate GATs. First stream generates essay-level predictions, second applies GAT to Transformer token embeddings using syntactic dependency edges, then fuses both streams.

Result: Outperforms baseline models on ELLIPSE dataset with average Quadratic Weighted Kappa of 0.854 across all analytic scoring dimensions.

Conclusion: TransGAT demonstrates the potential of integrating contextual Transformers with relational GNNs to advance automated essay scoring systems through effective analytic scoring.

Abstract: Essay writing is a critical component of student assessment, yet manual
scoring is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Automated Essay Scoring (AES)
offers a promising alternative, but current approaches face limitations. Recent
studies have incorporated Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into AES using static
word embeddings that fail to capture contextual meaning, especially for
polysemous words. Additionally, many methods rely on holistic scoring,
overlooking specific writing aspects such as grammar, vocabulary, and cohesion.
To address these challenges, this study proposes TransGAT, a novel approach
that integrates fine-tuned Transformer models with GNNs for analytic scoring.
TransGAT combines the contextual understanding of Transformers with the
relational modeling strength of Graph Attention Networks (GAT). It performs
two-stream predictions by pairing each fine-tuned Transformer (BERT, RoBERTa,
and DeBERTaV3) with a separate GAT. In each pair, the first stream generates
essay-level predictions, while the second applies GAT to Transformer token
embeddings, with edges constructed from syntactic dependencies. The model then
fuses predictions from both streams to produce the final analytic score.
Experiments on the ELLIPSE dataset show that TransGAT outperforms baseline
models, achieving an average Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.854 across all
analytic scoring dimensions. These findings highlight the potential of TransGAT
to advance AES systems.

TL;DR: A method for calculating word similarity using phonetic transcriptions with Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, implemented in Rust with CPU/GPU parallelization for efficient large-scale processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient computational approach for analyzing phonetic similarity between words across languages using pronunciation data.

Method: Uses Needleman-Wunsch algorithm on phonetic transcriptions, implemented in Rust with parallel CPU and GPU processing using CUDA/cudarc. Constructs fully-connected similarity graphs and applies clustering algorithms.

Result: Successfully demonstrated feasibility and effectiveness in analyzing phonetic language structures with significant performance improvements from GPU acceleration.

Conclusion: The method provides an effective approach for phonetic similarity analysis that can be expanded to multiple languages and handles large datasets efficiently.

Abstract: We present a method to calculate the similarity between words based on their
phonetic transcription (their pronunciation) using the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm. We implement this algorithm in Rust and parallelize it on both CPU
and GPU to handle large datasets efficiently. The GPU implementation leverages
CUDA and the cudarc Rust library to achieve significant performance
improvements. We validate our approach by constructing a fully-connected graph
where nodes represent words and edges have weights according to the similarity
between the words. This graph is then analyzed using clustering algorithms to
identify groups of phonetically similar words. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method in analyzing the phonetic
structure of languages. It might be easily expanded to other languages.

### [100] [Bridging Thoughts and Words: Graph-Based Intent-Semantic Joint Learning for Fake News Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01660)
*Zhengjia Wang,Qiang Sheng,Danding Wang,Beizhe Hu,Juan Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection by combining semantic clues with news intent signals through heterogeneous graph structures and dynamic pathway-based alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fake news detectors focus only on semantic patterns like emotional words and stylistic features, which are surface-level and can shift rapidly in dynamic environments, leading to limited performance. The paper aims to incorporate news intent to deeply understand inherent deception thoughts rather than surface patterns alone.

Method: InSide models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via graph-based joint learning. It reformulates signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enables long-range context interaction through entity guidance, and uses coarse-to-fine intent modeling. A dynamic pathway-based graph alignment strategy establishes a common space for effective message passing and aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Incorporating news intent alongside semantic signals through graph-based joint modeling provides a more robust approach to fake news detection that captures deeper deception patterns beyond surface-level semantic clues.

Abstract: Fake news detection is an important and challenging task for defending online
information integrity. Existing state-of-the-art approaches typically extract
news semantic clues, such as writing patterns that include emotional words,
stylistic features, etc. However, detectors tuned solely to such semantic clues
can easily fall into surface detection patterns, which can shift rapidly in
dynamic environments, leading to limited performance in the evolving news
landscape. To address this issue, this paper investigates a novel perspective
by incorporating news intent into fake news detection, bridging intents and
semantics together. The core insight is that by considering news intents, one
can deeply understand the inherent thoughts behind news deception, rather than
the surface patterns within words alone. To achieve this goal, we propose
Graph-based Intent-Semantic Joint Modeling (InSide) for fake news detection,
which models deception clues from both semantic and intent signals via
graph-based joint learning. Specifically, InSide reformulates news semantic and
intent signals into heterogeneous graph structures, enabling long-range context
interaction through entity guidance and capturing both holistic and
implementation-level intent via coarse-to-fine intent modeling. To achieve
better alignment between semantics and intents, we further develop a dynamic
pathway-based graph alignment strategy for effective message passing and
aggregation across these signals by establishing a common space. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed InSide compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Abdelkrime Aries*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Character-level pre-trained language model (chDzDT) for Algerian dialect that handles complex morphology, code-switching, and multiple scripts by training on isolated words rather than token sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The Algerian dialect is under-represented in NLP due to its complex morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and lexical influences from other languages, which make conventional tokenization approaches ineffective.

Method: Developed chDzDT - a character-level PLM trained on isolated words from diverse sources (YouTube comments, French/English/Berber Wikipedia, Tatoeba project) to encode morphological patterns without relying on token boundaries or standardized orthography.

Result: The model demonstrates robust morphological encoding capabilities and serves as an effective morphology-focused encoder for downstream tasks in low-resource dialects.

Conclusion: Character-level modeling shows strong potential for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and provides a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems that can handle linguistic diversity.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural
language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations.
However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated
models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex
morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical
influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization
and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained
language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that
rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design
allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending
on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from
diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber
Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and
linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of
Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a
multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive
evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for
downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of
character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and
lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

### [102] [Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01790)
*Andong Hua,Kenan Tang,Chenhe Gu,Jindong Gu,Eric Wong,Yao Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompt sensitivity in LLMs may be more due to evaluation artifacts than inherent model weaknesses, as LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation shows reduced variance and better correlation across prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether the widely reported high prompt sensitivity is truly an inherent weakness of LLMs or largely an artifact of evaluation processes.

Method: Systematically evaluated 7 LLMs across 6 benchmarks using 12 diverse prompt templates, comparing heuristic evaluation methods with LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations.

Result: Found that prompt sensitivity largely stems from heuristic evaluation methods that overlook semantically correct responses. LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations showed substantial reduction in performance variance and higher correlation in model rankings.

Conclusion: Modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e.,
repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to
significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely
accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and
ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness
of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this
question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family)
across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12
diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems
from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid
answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed
through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt
LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance
variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across
prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt
templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an
artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

*Shreyas Tirumala,Nishant Jain,Danny D. Leybzon,Trent D. Buskirk*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI interviewers using LLMs outperform traditional IVR systems for both quantitative and qualitative data collection, but face challenges with transcription errors, emotion detection, and follow-up quality that limit their utility for qualitative research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the fitness of AI interviewing systems based on Large Language Models for quantitative and qualitative research data collection compared to traditional Interactive Voice Response systems.

Method: Review of emerging evidence and evaluation across two dimensions: input/output performance (speech recognition, recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (probing, clarifying, branching logic). Field studies were conducted to assess capabilities.

Result: AI interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and qualitative data collection. However, they face issues with real-time transcription error rates, limited emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality.

Conclusion: While AI interviewers show superior performance over IVR systems, their utility and adoption for qualitative data collection may be context-dependent due to current limitations in transcription accuracy, emotion handling, and follow-up consistency.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI
interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in
real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when
such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within
quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of
AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems
across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition,
answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to
probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI
interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and
qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited
emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the
utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be
context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

*Zhimeng Luo,Abhibha Gupta,Adam Frisch,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel LLM-based approach converts EHR OPQRST assessment extraction from sequence labeling to text generation with reasoning, enhancing interpretability and addressing limited labeled data in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML methods fail to efficiently extract critical patient information from complex unstructured EHR data, making clinical tools ineffective for patient care.

Method: Reframe task from sequence labeling to text generation using LLMs, incorporating reasoning steps that mimic physician cognition. Propose modified NER metrics with semantic similarity measures like BERT Score for evaluation.

Result: Significant advancement in AI healthcare applications, providing scalable solution that improves accuracy and usability of EHR information extraction.

Conclusion: The approach aids clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhances patient care outcomes by improving information extraction from electronic health records.

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records
(EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured
nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to
capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to
utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel
approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task
from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide
reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach
enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled
data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of
evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by
proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics.
This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT
Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent
of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant
advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that
improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs,
thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing
patient care outcomes.

*Zhimeng Luo,Zhendong Wang,Rui Meng,Diyang Xue,Adam Frisch,Daqing He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Weakly supervised method for extracting and linking medical entities from chief complaints without human annotation, using split-and-match algorithm and BERT-based model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chief complaint records vary widely in medical notations across institutions, making standardization difficult for record keeping and text mining. Current methods require human annotation which is time-consuming and expensive.

Method: 1) Split-and-match algorithm to generate weak annotations on 1.2M de-identified chief complaint records 2) Train BERT-based model with weak labels to locate entity mentions and link to pre-defined ontology

Result: Superior performance over previous methods without any human annotation requirements

Conclusion: The proposed weakly supervised approach effectively standardizes chief complaint entity extraction and linking across medical institutions without costly human annotation.

Abstract: A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the
patient's own words. It helps medical professionals to quickly understand a
patient's situation, and also serves as a short summary for medical text
mining. However, chief complaint records often take a variety of entering
methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record
keeping or text mining. In this study, we propose a weakly supervised method to
automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions
in chief complaint text and link them to a pre-defined ontology. We conducted
extensive experiments, and the results showed that our Weakly Supervised Entity
Extraction and Linking (\ours) method produced superior performance over
previous methods without any human annotation.

*Sachin Pawar,Manoj Apte,Girish K. Palshikar,Basit Ali,Nitin Ramrakhiyani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DRAssist system uses LLMs to assist human judges in resolving disputes by extracting structured elements from unstructured descriptions and providing multi-level resolution outputs across insurance and domain name disputes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disputes occur across many domains and are typically resolved by human judges through complex fact analysis and argument evaluation. There's a need for AI assistance to help judges handle this workload more efficiently.

Method: Developed DRAssist system that identifies key structural elements (facts, disagreement aspects, arguments) from unstructured dispute descriptions, then uses multiple prompting strategies with LLMs to produce resolution outputs at three levels: identifying stronger party, evaluating specific demands, and assessing argument strength.

Result: The system was evaluated on automobile insurance and domain name disputes, comparing LLM performance against relevant baselines using appropriate evaluation metrics (specific results not detailed in abstract).

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively serve as assistants to human judges in dispute resolution by providing structured analysis and multi-level evaluation of disputes across different domains.

Abstract: Disputes between two parties occur in almost all domains such as taxation,
insurance, banking, healthcare, etc. The disputes are generally resolved in a
specific forum (e.g., consumer court) where facts are presented, points of
disagreement are discussed, arguments as well as specific demands of the
parties are heard, and finally a human judge resolves the dispute by often
favouring one of the two parties. In this paper, we explore the use of large
language models (LLMs) as assistants for the human judge to resolve such
disputes, as part of our DRAssist system. We focus on disputes from two
specific domains -- automobile insurance and domain name disputes. DRAssist
identifies certain key structural elements (e.g., facts, aspects or
disagreement, arguments) of the disputes and summarizes the unstructured
dispute descriptions to produce a structured summary for each dispute. We then
explore multiple prompting strategies with multiple LLMs for their ability to
assist in resolving the disputes in these domains. In DRAssist, these LLMs are
prompted to produce the resolution output at three different levels -- (i)
identifying an overall stronger party in a dispute, (ii) decide whether each
specific demand of each contesting party can be accepted or not, (iii) evaluate
whether each argument by each contesting party is strong or weak. We evaluate
the performance of LLMs on all these tasks by comparing them with relevant
baselines using suitable evaluation metrics.

*Chao Xue,Ziyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StructCoh is a graph-enhanced contrastive learning framework that combines structural reasoning with representation optimization for text semantic matching, achieving state-of-the-art results on legal and academic document matching tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained language models excel at token-level interactions but often overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic discrimination in text matching tasks.

Method: Uses a dual-graph encoder with dependency parsing and topic modeling to construct semantic graphs, then employs graph isomorphism networks. Features hierarchical contrastive learning with node-level regularization and graph-aware contrastive objectives using explicit and implicit negative sampling.

Result: Achieves 86.7% F1-score (+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching and demonstrates significant improvements on three legal document matching benchmarks and academic plagiarism detection datasets.

Conclusion: StructCoh effectively combines structural reasoning with representation optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by better capturing hierarchical structural patterns and fine-grained semantic distinctions.

Abstract: Text semantic matching requires nuanced understanding of both structural
relationships and fine-grained semantic distinctions. While pre-trained
language models excel at capturing token-level interactions, they often
overlook hierarchical structural patterns and struggle with subtle semantic
discrimination. In this paper, we proposed StructCoh, a graph-enhanced
contrastive learning framework that synergistically combines structural
reasoning with representation space optimization. Our approach features two key
innovations: (1) A dual-graph encoder constructs semantic graphs via dependency
parsing and topic modeling, then employs graph isomorphism networks to
propagate structural features across syntactic dependencies and cross-document
concept nodes. (2) A hierarchical contrastive objective enforces consistency at
multiple granularities: node-level contrastive regularization preserves core
semantic units, while graph-aware contrastive learning aligns inter-document
structural semantics through both explicit and implicit negative sampling
strategies. Experiments on three legal document matching benchmarks and
academic plagiarism detection datasets demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, StructCoh achieves 86.7% F1-score
(+6.2% absolute gain) on legal statute matching by effectively identifying
argument structure similarities.

TL;DR: DeepSeek V3 outperformed GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Copilot in analyzing longitudinal dental cases, showing superior accuracy and expert ratings while maintaining readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to interpret longitudinal patient narratives in healthcare, using dentistry as a testbed due to its structured clinical data.

Method: Evaluated 4 LLMs on 34 standardized longitudinal periodontal cases (258 QA pairs) using automated metrics and blinded evaluations by licensed dentists.

Result: DeepSeek V3 achieved highest faithfulness (median 0.528 vs 0.367-0.457) and expert ratings (median 4.5/5 vs 4.0/5) without compromising readability.

Conclusion: DeepSeek is the leading LLM for medical case analysis and shows promise as an adjunct tool in medical education and research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet
their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains
inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured
clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs'
reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a
model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the
competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini
2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal
dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized
longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we
assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by
licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating
superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert
ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising
readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis,
endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and
research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

TL;DR: Genetic Prompt combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to enhance synthetic data generation quality and diversity through simulated crossover and mutation operations on semantic text attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models are good at generating synthetic data but struggle with maintaining quality and diversity, requiring better methods to produce synthetic distributions closer to real-world data.

Method: A framework that treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences and uses LLMs to simulate genetic operations (crossover and mutation), integrated with active learning for optimal parent selection to expand search space.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, shows robust performance across various model sizes, and boosts downstream model performance when fused with original training data, especially in class-imbalanced scenarios.

Conclusion: Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality synthetic data that benefits a wide range of NLP applications by improving data quality and diversity through genetic algorithm principles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating synthetic data, but ensuring
its quality and diversity remains challenging. We propose Genetic Prompt, a
novel framework that combines genetic algorithms with LLMs to augment synthetic
data generation. Our approach treats semantic text attributes as gene sequences
and leverages the LLM to simulate crossover and mutation operations. This
genetic process enhances data quality and diversity by creating novel attribute
combinations, yielding synthetic distributions closer to real-world data. To
optimize parent selection, we also integrate an active learning scheme that
expands the offspring search space. Our experiments on multiple NLP tasks
reveal several key findings: Genetic Prompt not only significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines but also shows robust performance across various
generator model sizes and scales. Moreover, we demonstrate that fusing our
synthetic data with the original training set significantly boosts downstream
model performance, particularly for class-imbalanced scenarios. Our findings
validate that Genetic Prompt is an effective method for producing high-quality
synthetic data for a wide range of NLP applications.

*Elisabetta Rocchetti,Alfio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction-tuning improves LLMs' length-controlled text generation by specializing deeper layers, with attention heads dominant in English and MLPs compensating in Italian.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models struggle with explicit length constraints like precise word count generation, and this study aims to understand how foundation models differ from instruction-tuned models in handling this task across English and Italian.

Method: The study analyzes performance and internal component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived from Direct Logit Attribution, comparing foundation models and instruction-tuned models on length-controlled text generation.

Result: Instruction-tuning substantially improves length control by specializing components in deeper layers. Attention heads in later layers show increasingly positive contributions in English, while in Italian, final-layer MLPs exhibit stronger positive role as a compensatory mechanism.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for better task adherence, with component-level strategies adapting to linguistic context - attention heads dominant in English and MLPs playing compensatory role in Italian.

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a
precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation
models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text
generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal
component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived
from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning
substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in
deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models
show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian,
while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a
stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results
indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence,
with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

TL;DR: CRPO is a novel prompt optimization framework that uses contrastive reasoning with retrieved reference prompts to improve LLM performance by learning from both good and bad examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples for better prompt optimization.

Method: Retrieves top k reference prompts from HelpSteer2 dataset and uses two paradigms: tiered contrastive reasoning (comparing high/medium/low quality prompts) and multi-metric contrastive reasoning (analyzing best prompts along each evaluation dimension).

Result: Experimental results on HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: Contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning shows promise for advancing automatic prompt optimization by enabling models to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail.

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for
improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the
goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work
focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the
potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from
contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a
retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference
prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for
helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs
two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning,
where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own
generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive
reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation
dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By
explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model
to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more
robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2
benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our
findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning
for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

TL;DR: JudgeAgent is a dynamic evaluation framework that uses interviewer-style interactions to overcome limitations of current static LLM evaluation methods, providing more accurate assessment of model capabilities through adaptive difficulty adjustment and knowledge-driven testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods based on predefined question sets have limitations including limited interaction, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulty verifying result validity, making it hard to precisely determine model knowledge and capability boundaries.

Method: Proposes JudgeAgent framework with knowledge-driven data synthesis, target-adaptive difficulty adjustment, and comprehensive evaluation approach including benchmark grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback using interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its dynamic evaluation paradigm in providing accurate and effective evaluation results compared to traditional static methods.

Conclusion: JudgeAgent addresses key challenges in LLM evaluation through its adaptive dynamic framework, offering more precise determination of model capabilities and knowledge boundaries through interactive, difficulty-adjusted testing.

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential
step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The
current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them
with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers
controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited
interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in
verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely
determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address
these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic
evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm.
JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark
grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes
knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment
methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective
evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating
evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its
dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: CMRAG is a co-modality RAG framework that simultaneously leverages text and images for document QA, outperforming vision-only methods by integrating structured parsing, cross-modal retrieval, and VLM generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods have limitations with multimodal documents - text-based methods miss visual information while vision-only methods ignore text semantics, leading to suboptimal performance in document QA tasks.

Method: 1) Structured parsing to obtain co-modality representations of text segments and image regions 2) Separate retrieval from text and image channels 3) Cross-modal retrieval result aggregation 4) VLM prompting for final response generation

Result: Significantly outperforms pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks

Conclusion: Integrating co-modality information in a unified RAG framework is effective for improving complex document VQA system performance

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a core paradigm in document
question answering tasks. However, existing methods have limitations when
dealing with multimodal documents: one category of methods relies on layout
analysis and text extraction, which can only utilize explicit text information
and struggle to capture images or unstructured content; the other category
treats document segmentation as visual input and directly passes it to visual
language models (VLMs) for processing, yet it ignores the semantic advantages
of text, leading to suboptimal generation results. This paper proposes
co-modality-based RAG (CMRAG), which can simultaneously leverage text and
images for efficient retrieval and generation. Specifically, we first perform
structured parsing on documents to obtain co-modality representations of text
segments and image regions. Subsequently, in response to user queries, we
retrieve candidate evidence from text and image channels, respectively, and
aggregate the results at the cross-modal retrieval level. Finally, we prompt
the VLM to generate the final response based on the co-modality retrieval
results. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
pure-vision-based RAG in visual document question answering tasks. The findings
of this paper show that integrating co-modality information into the RAG
framework in a unified manner is an effective approach to improving the
performance of complex document visual question-answering (VQA) systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMBEDKAR framework uses speculative decoding with constitutional guidance to reduce caste and religious biases in LLMs for Indian context without model retraining, achieving 26.41% bias reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address specific caste and religious biases prevalent in Indian society that LLMs reflect from training data.

Method: Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer using speculative decoding where a small model generates text and a constitutionally-guided large model verifies and enforces bias-robust trajectories, without parameter updates.

Result: Achieves absolute bias reduction of up to 26.41% compared to baseline models while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses local Indian biases through constitutional guidance and speculative decoding, providing an effective and efficient bias mitigation approach without model retraining.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can inadvertently reflect societal biases
present in their training data, leading to harmful or prejudiced outputs. In
the Indian context, our empirical evaluations across a suite of models reveal
that biases around caste and religion are particularly salient. Yet, most
existing mitigation strategies are Western-centric and fail to address these
local nuances. We propose AMBEDKAR, a framework inspired by the egalitarian
vision of Dr B. R. Ambedkar, architect of the Indian Constitution, to guide LLM
outputs toward fairness, neutrality, and inclusion in line with Articles 14 to
17. Our approach introduces a Constitution-Aware Decoding Layer, guided by the
AI Constitution of India and applied only at inference time, without any
parameter updates to the base model. We incorporate a speculative decoding
algorithm that proactively reduces casteist and communal bias during
generation. This mitigation layer operates directly within the decoding
process, avoiding changes to model internals and lowering the computational and
infrastructural costs associated with retraining. We reinterpret speculative
decoding not merely as an efficiency tool but as a mechanism for fairness. In
this framework, a Small Language Model (SLM) acts as a potentially biased
generator, while a constitutionally guided Large Language Model (LLM) serves as
the verifier. Rather than accelerating generation, the LLM enforces bias-robust
trajectories in the SLM outputs. This inversion of roles gives rise to a
fairness-by-speculation paradigm. Our approach yields an absolute reduction of
bias up to 26.41 percent compared to baseline. Our source code, datasets, and
results are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/AMBEDKAR-983B/

*David Demitri Africa,Suchir Salhan,Yuval Weiss,Paula Buttery,Richard Diehl Martinez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small decoder LMs pretrained with MAML show improved zero-shot NER performance in low-resource languages, with 2-6 pp F1 gains and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address NER in low-resource languages where large multilingual LMs are infeasible due to memory/latency constraints, by enabling small LMs to adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to unseen languages.

Method: Replace part of autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) during pretraining of small decoder LMs (11M-570M parameters). Tested on Tagalog and Cebuano as challenging typologically similar languages.

Result: MAML improved zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp with head-only tuning and 1-3 pp with full tuning, while reducing convergence time by up to 8%. Largest gains for single-token person entities co-occurring with Tagalog case particles.

Conclusion: Meta-learning during pretraining enables small LMs to better adapt to low-resource languages, with surface anchors like case particles being particularly important for zero-shot transfer.

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled
by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible
in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs
can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to
languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the
autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML).
Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in
their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed.
Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp
under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence
time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that
co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of
surface anchors.

*Kyeongman Park,Nakyeong Yang,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Avoidance Decoding is a novel decoding strategy that penalizes similarity to previous outputs to increase diversity in LLM-generated stories, achieving 2.6x higher diversity and 30% less repetition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in story generation tasks, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt.

Method: A decoding strategy that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs using two adaptive similarity measures: Concept-level Similarity Penalty (prioritized early) and Narrative-level Similarity Penalty (emphasized later).

Result: Achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while mitigating text degeneration. Activates a broader range of neurons.

Conclusion: The method effectively leverages the model's intrinsic creativity to produce more diverse and less repetitive story outputs while maintaining natural plot development.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous
outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative
diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token
logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby
encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances
two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is
prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2)
Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to
ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to
2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30%
compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration.
Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons,
demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FActBench is a comprehensive fact-checking benchmark for medical domain LLMs that uses CoT prompting and NLI techniques, with unanimous voting correlating best with expert evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with specialized domains like medicine where factuality is critical, and there's a need for reliable fact-checking tools and data sources to mitigate hallucinations.

Method: Created FActBench covering 4 generation tasks and 6 state-of-the-art LLMs for medical domain, using Chain-of-Thought prompting and Natural Language Inference techniques for fact-checking.

Result: Experiments showed that fact-checking scores obtained through unanimous voting of both techniques (CoT and NLI) correlate best with domain expert evaluation.

Conclusion: The unanimous voting approach combining CoT prompting and NLI provides the most reliable fact-checking method that aligns with expert assessment in medical domain LLM evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models tend to struggle when dealing with specialized domains.
While all aspects of evaluation hold importance, factuality is the most
critical one. Similarly, reliable fact-checking tools and data sources are
essential for hallucination mitigation. We address these issues by providing a
comprehensive Fact-checking Benchmark FActBench covering four generation tasks
and six state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for the Medical domain.
We use two state-of-the-art Fact-checking techniques: Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
Prompting and Natural Language Inference (NLI). Our experiments show that the
fact-checking scores acquired through the Unanimous Voting of both techniques
correlate best with Domain Expert Evaluation.

*Jaime Collado-Montañez,L. Alfonso Ureña-López,Arturo Montejo-Ráez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Smaller language models with external fact retrieval tools outperform monolithic models by separating linguistic competence from factual memorization, offering more efficient and sustainable NLP solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of large language models including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and high computational costs caused by combining linguistic competence and factual memorization in single models.

Method: Proposed Fundamental Language Model (FLM) paradigm using smaller linguistically competent models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. Evaluated models from 135M to 32B parameters across linguistic competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge dimensions.

Result: Found that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster, indicating model size is more tied to memorization than core language ability.

Conclusion: Supports modular approach with compact linguistically proficient models as foundation for tool-augmented systems, offering path toward more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models offer impressive language capabilities but suffer from
well-known limitations, including hallucinations, biases, privacy concerns, and
high computational costs. These issues are largely driven by the combination of
linguistic competence and factual memorization within a single monolithic
model. This paper introduces and empirically supports the Fundamental Language
Model (FLM) paradigm, which advocates for smaller, linguistically competent
models that offload factual retrieval to external tools. We evaluate models
ranging from 135M to 32B parameters across three dimensions: linguistic
competence, external factual knowledge, and internal factual knowledge. Our
findings reveal that while both linguistic competence and factual knowledge
improve with scale, internal factual knowledge grows significantly faster,
suggesting that model size is more closely tied to memorization than to core
language ability. These results support a modular approach to language
modeling, where compact, linguistically proficient models serve as the
foundation for tool-augmented systems. The FLM paradigm offers a path toward
more efficient, interpretable, and sustainable NLP solutions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can track team shared mental models and detect discrepancies in team dialogues, but struggle with spatial reasoning and prosodic cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage LLMs for analyzing team communication by detecting blind spots and discrepancies in shared understanding during collaborative tasks.

Method: Two-step framework: 1) LLM annotates team dialogues to identify shared mental model elements, 2) Secondary LLM compares LLM vs human annotations against gold standards to detect divergences.

Result: LLMs show apparent coherence on straightforward annotation tasks but systematically fail in scenarios requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

Conclusion: While LLMs can be effective for basic team dialogue analysis, they have limitations in complex reasoning scenarios, particularly involving spatial understanding and subtle communication cues.

Abstract: What if large language models could not only infer human mindsets but also
expose every blind spot in team dialogue such as discrepancies in the team
members' joint understanding? We present a novel, two-step framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) both as human-style annotators of team
dialogues to track the team's shared mental models (SMMs) and as automated
discrepancy detectors among individuals' mental states. In the first step, an
LLM generates annotations by identifying SMM elements within task-oriented
dialogues from the Cooperative Remote Search Task (CReST) corpus. Then, a
secondary LLM compares these LLM-derived annotations and human annotations
against gold-standard labels to detect and characterize divergences. We define
an SMM coherence evaluation framework for this use case and apply it to six
CReST dialogues, ultimately producing: (1) a dataset of human and LLM
annotations; (2) a reproducible evaluation framework for SMM coherence; and (3)
an empirical assessment of LLM-based discrepancy detection. Our results reveal
that, although LLMs exhibit apparent coherence on straightforward
natural-language annotation tasks, they systematically err in scenarios
requiring spatial reasoning or disambiguation of prosodic cues.

*Shihui Yang,Chengfeng Dou,Peidong Guo,Kai Lu,Qiang Ju,Fei Deng,Rihui Xin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DCPO introduces dynamic clipping and smooth advantage standardization to fix zero gradient issues in RLVR, achieving SOTA performance on multiple benchmarks with improved training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR approaches like GRPO suffer from zero gradients due to fixed clipping bounds and identical reward standardization, leading to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses.

Method: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO) with adaptive clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities for better exploration, and smooth advantage standardization across cumulative training steps for improved response utilization.

Result: Achieved SOTA on 4 benchmarks: 46.7/38.8 (Avg@1/Avg@32) on AIME24 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B, 23.3/19.0 on AIME25 with Qwen2.5-14B. 28% improvement in nonzero advantage, doubled training efficiency, and order-of-magnitude reduction in token clipping ratio.

Conclusion: DCPO effectively leverages generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in LLMs, solving zero gradient problems and significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero
gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for
token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards,
which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of
generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy
Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that
adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior
probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage
standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training
steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated
responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based
on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under
greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24
benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the
Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO
achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO
(20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the
nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency
over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of
magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance.
These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more
efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Survey paper on implicit reasoning in LLMs, focusing on internal computation mechanisms without explicit intermediate steps, organized by execution paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surveys discuss latent representations but lack dedicated mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs.

Method: Introduces taxonomy centered on execution paradigms, organizing methods into three categories: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent execution.

Result: Provides structured overview of evaluation metrics and benchmarks for assessing implicit reasoning effectiveness and reliability.

Conclusion: Fills the gap in understanding internal reasoning mechanisms in LLMs and provides comprehensive framework for analyzing implicit reasoning approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a
wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step
problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent
studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward
implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures
without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings
advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better
alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed
latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and
mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs
remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered
on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to
computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution
paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation
unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent
execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based
evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further
provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in
existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit
reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at:

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable method using LLMs as automated annotators to build temporal opinion knowledge bases with structured opinion extraction from text, enabling time-series analysis for applications like forecasting and trend analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methodologies underutilize time-series opinion analysis due to lack of temporally grounded fine-grained annotations, creating a gap in downstream applications such as forecasting and trend analysis.

Method: Integrates established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation pipeline for structured opinion extraction without manual prompt engineering, using three data models based on sentiment and opinion mining literature as schemas.

Result: Rigorous quantitative evaluation using human-annotated test samples shows successful annotation with two separate LLMs, with inter-annotator agreement computed across fine-grained opinion dimensions following human annotation protocols.

Conclusion: The resulting knowledge base provides time-aligned, structured opinions compatible with applications in RAG, temporal question answering, and timeline summarization, addressing the annotation gap in temporal opinion analysis.

Abstract: We propose a scalable method for constructing a temporal opinion knowledge
base with large language models (LLMs) as automated annotators. Despite the
demonstrated utility of time-series opinion analysis of text for downstream
applications such as forecasting and trend analysis, existing methodologies
underexploit this potential due to the absence of temporally grounded
fine-grained annotations. Our approach addresses this gap by integrating
well-established opinion mining formulations into a declarative LLM annotation
pipeline, enabling structured opinion extraction without manual prompt
engineering. We define three data models grounded in sentiment and opinion
mining literature, serving as schemas for structured representation. We perform
rigorous quantitative evaluation of our pipeline using human-annotated test
samples. We carry out the final annotations using two separate LLMs, and
inter-annotator agreement is computed label-wise across the fine-grained
opinion dimensions, analogous to human annotation protocols. The resulting
knowledge base encapsulates time-aligned, structured opinions and is compatible
with applications in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), temporal question
answering, and timeline summarisation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel approach for Arabic disease classification using LLM-based preprocessing (summarization, refinement, NER) combined with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models and majority voting ensemble, achieving 80.56% accuracy on social telehealth data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social telehealth platforms generate vast amounts of Arabic medical text data that can be leveraged for disease classification, but existing methods need improvement in processing complex Arabic medical language.

Method: Three Arabic medical text preprocessing methods (summarization, refinement, NER) using LLMs, followed by fine-tuning Arabic transformer models (CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, AsafayaBERT), and employing majority voting ensemble on original and preprocessed text representations.

Result: Achieved best classification accuracy of 80.56%, demonstrating effectiveness of combining various text representations and model predictions for Arabic medical text understanding.

Conclusion: The integration of LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformers and ensemble learning is effective for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth data, representing the first such approach in this domain.

Abstract: Social telehealth has made remarkable progress in healthcare by allowing
patients to post symptoms and participate in medical consultations remotely.
Users frequently post symptoms on social media and online health platforms,
creating a huge repository of medical data that can be leveraged for disease
classification. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLAMA3 and GPT-3.5, along
with transformer-based models like BERT, have demonstrated strong capabilities
in processing complex medical text. In this study, we evaluate three Arabic
medical text preprocessing methods such as summarization, refinement, and Named
Entity Recognition (NER) before applying fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
(CAMeLBERT, AraBERT, and AsafayaBERT). To enhance robustness, we adopt a
majority voting ensemble that combines predictions from original and
preprocessed text representations. This approach achieved the best
classification accuracy of 80.56%, thus showing its effectiveness in leveraging
various text representations and model predictions to improve the understanding
of medical texts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
integrates LLM-based preprocessing with fine-tuned Arabic transformer models
and ensemble learning for disease classification in Arabic social telehealth
data.

TL;DR: EmoPerso is a self-supervised framework that improves personality detection from text by leveraging emotion-aware modeling, synthetic data augmentation, and multi-task learning with cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personality detection methods rely heavily on large annotated datasets and treat emotion and personality as independent variables, overlooking their interactions, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality labels.

Method: EmoPerso uses generative mechanisms for synthetic data augmentation, extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features, employs multi-task learning with personality prediction, and uses cross-attention modules to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and emotional representations. It also adopts a self-taught strategy for iterative reasoning enhancement.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models in personality detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed EmoPerso framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by integrating emotion-aware modeling and self-supervised learning, achieving superior performance in personality detection from text without relying on large-scale annotated datasets.

Abstract: Personality detection from text is commonly performed by analysing users'
social media posts. However, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale
annotated datasets, making it challenging to obtain high-quality personality
labels. Moreover, most studies treat emotion and personality as independent
variables, overlooking their interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel
self-supervised framework, EmoPerso, which improves personality detection
through emotion-aware modelling. EmoPerso first leverages generative mechanisms
for synthetic data augmentation and rich representation learning. It then
extracts pseudo-labeled emotion features and jointly optimizes them with
personality prediction via multi-task learning. A cross-attention module is
employed to capture fine-grained interactions between personality traits and
the inferred emotional representations. To further refine relational reasoning,
EmoPerso adopts a self-taught strategy to enhance the model's reasoning
capabilities iteratively. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets
demonstrate that EmoPerso surpasses state-of-the-art models. The source code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs don't consistently integrate external definitions and often default to internal knowledge, with domain-specific tasks benefiting more from explicit definitions than general tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions or primarily rely on their parametric knowledge during task-solving.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) with various label definition conditions including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions.

Result: Explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, but their integration is neither guaranteed nor consistent. Models often default to internal representations, especially in general tasks, while domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.

Conclusion: LLMs' processing of external knowledge alongside pre-existing capabilities requires deeper understanding, as they show inconsistent integration of external definitions and frequent reliance on internalized representations.

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely
on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct
controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general
and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated,
LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that
while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their
integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor
consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases.
Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general
tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions.
These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs
process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated framework audits foundation models against their providers' behavioral guidelines, finding systematic inconsistencies and compliance gaps up to 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation model providers publish behavioral guidelines but there's no systematic audit to verify if models actually adhere to these specifications.

Method: Developed an automated framework that parses behavioral statements, generates targeted prompts, and uses models themselves as judges to evaluate three-way consistency between provider specifications, model outputs, and model judgments.

Result: Applied to 16 models from 6 developers across 100+ behavioral statements, revealing systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up to 20% across providers.

Conclusion: Establishes a necessary baseline for foundation model accountability - models should consistently satisfy developer specifications when judged by developer evaluator models, but current implementations show significant gaps.

Abstract: Companies that develop foundation models publish behavioral guidelines they
pledge their models will follow, but it remains unclear if models actually do
so. While providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have published
detailed specifications describing both desired safety constraints and
qualitative traits for their models, there has been no systematic audit of
adherence to these guidelines. We introduce an automated framework that audits
models against their providers specifications by parsing behavioral statements,
generating targeted prompts, and using models to judge adherence. Our central
focus is on three way consistency between a provider specification, its model
outputs, and its own models as judges; an extension of prior two way generator
validator consistency. This establishes a necessary baseline: at minimum, a
foundation model should consistently satisfy the developer behavioral
specifications when judged by the developer evaluator models. We apply our
framework to 16 models from six developers across more than 100 behavioral
statements, finding systematic inconsistencies including compliance gaps of up
to 20 percent across providers.

TL;DR: GRAM-R² is a generative reward model that produces both preference labels and reward rationales through self-training on unlabeled data, outperforming discriminative and generative baselines across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models heavily rely on large-scale labeled preference data, and existing pre-training approaches fail to instill explicit reasoning capabilities into reward models.

Method: Proposed self-training approach leveraging unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning. Developed GRAM-R², a generative reward model that produces preference labels and accompanying rationales.

Result: GRAM-R² consistently delivers strong performance in response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, outperforming several strong baselines.

Conclusion: GRAM-R² serves as an effective foundation model for reward reasoning that can be applied to wide range of tasks with minimal fine-tuning, supporting downstream applications like response ranking and task-specific reward tuning.

Abstract: Significant progress in reward modeling over recent years has been driven by
a paradigm shift from task-specific designs towards generalist reward models.
Despite this trend, developing effective reward models remains a fundamental
challenge: the heavy reliance on large-scale labeled preference data.
Pre-training on abundant unlabeled data offers a promising direction, but
existing approaches fall short of instilling explicit reasoning into reward
models. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-training approach that leverages
unlabeled data to elicit reward reasoning in reward models. Based on this
approach, we develop GRAM-R$^2$, a generative reward model trained to produce
not only preference labels but also accompanying reward rationales. GRAM-R$^2$
can serve as a foundation model for reward reasoning and can be applied to a
wide range of tasks with minimal or no additional fine-tuning. It can support
downstream applications such as response ranking and task-specific reward
tuning. Experiments on response ranking, task adaptation, and reinforcement
learning from human feedback demonstrate that GRAM-R$^2$ consistently delivers
strong performance, outperforming several strong discriminative and generative
baselines.

### [129] [MoSEs: Uncertainty-Aware AI-Generated Text Detection via Mixture of Stylistics Experts with Conditional Thresholds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02499)
*Junxi Wu,Jinpeng Wang,Zheng Liu,Bin Chen,Dongjian Hu,Hao Wu,Shu-Tao Xiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MoSEs framework for AI-generated text detection using stylistic modeling and dynamic threshold estimation, achieving 11.34% average improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing AI-generated text detection methods that neglect stylistic modeling and rely on static thresholds, which limits detection performance.

Method: Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework with three components: Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE) that jointly models linguistic statistical properties and semantic features for dynamic threshold estimation.

Result: Achieves 11.34% average improvement in detection performance compared to baselines, with 39.15% improvement in low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: MoSEs framework effectively addresses stylistic modeling and dynamic threshold estimation challenges in AI-generated text detection, showing significant performance improvements especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public
concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build
trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect
stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits
the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic
Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty
quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three
core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the
Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE).
For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and
provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic
statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the
optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels
with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average
improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More
inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource
case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

*Nishant Tanksale,Tanmay Kokate,Darshan Gohad,Sarvadnyaa Barate,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID dataset for evaluating semantic understanding in 10 low-resource Indic languages through headline identification task with four variants per article.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of high-quality benchmarks for semantic evaluation in low-resource Indic languages, particularly for sentence transformers which show strong performance in high-resource settings but remain underexplored in Indic contexts.

Method: Created a curated dataset of 20,000 news articles per language with four headline variants (original, semantically similar, lexically similar, unrelated) to test fine-grained semantic understanding. Benchmarked multilingual and language-specific sentence transformers using cosine similarity for headline selection task.

Result: Multilingual models consistently perform well across languages, while language-specific models show varying effectiveness. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for evaluating semantic understanding in RAG pipelines and can be repurposed for multiple NLP tasks.

Conclusion: The L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID dataset bridges the benchmark gap for semantic evaluation in low-resource Indic languages, demonstrating the effectiveness of multilingual models and providing a versatile resource for various NLP applications including RAG systems and LLM evaluations.

Abstract: Semantic evaluation in low-resource languages remains a major challenge in
NLP. While sentence transformers have shown strong performance in high-resource
settings, their effectiveness in Indic languages is underexplored due to a lack
of high-quality benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce
L3Cube-IndicHeadline-ID, a curated headline identification dataset spanning ten
low-resource Indic languages: Marathi, Hindi, Tamil, Gujarati, Odia, Kannada,
Malayalam, Punjabi, Telugu, Bengali and English. Each language includes 20,000
news articles paired with four headline variants: the original, a semantically
similar version, a lexically similar version, and an unrelated one, designed to
test fine-grained semantic understanding. The task requires selecting the
correct headline from the options using article-headline similarity. We
benchmark several sentence transformers, including multilingual and
language-specific models, using cosine similarity. Results show that
multilingual models consistently perform well, while language-specific models
vary in effectiveness. Given the rising use of similarity models in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, this dataset also serves as a
valuable resource for evaluating and improving semantic understanding in such
applications. Additionally, the dataset can be repurposed for multiple-choice
question answering, headline classification, or other task-specific evaluations
of LLMs, making it a versatile benchmark for Indic NLP. The dataset is shared
publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/indic-nlp

### [131] [The Forgotten Code: Validating a Century-Old Translation System with AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02506)
*Jean-Marie Le Ray*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI successfully validates and revives Federico Pucci's 1931 mechanical translation system, demonstrating consistent translation results across multiple languages using his method nearly a century later.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To breathe new life into Federico Pucci's pioneering 1931 mechanical translation system, validate its effectiveness using modern AI, and establish Pucci's historical significance in machine translation history alongside figures like Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver.

Method: Using AI to retranslate the exact same text excerpts that Pucci translated in 1931 (Dante's La Vita Nuova from Italian to French, and Voltaire's Zadig from French to Italian) following Pucci's original method of international keys and ideograms for Romance languages.

Result: The AI translations showed low average difference with only minor variations compared to Pucci's 1931 translations. The method was then successfully extended to English, Spanish, and German, producing consistent results. Modern technical texts were also translated successfully.

Conclusion: Pucci's 1931 mechanical translation system is validated and proven effective using modern AI, reviving an almost unknown invention and establishing Pucci as a significant precursor in machine translation history whose work deserves recognition alongside other pioneers.

Abstract: A pioneering rule-based mechanical translation system (precursor of modern
RBMTs) was first presented in December 1929 by its inventor, Federico Pucci,
who later published the full method in a book titled "Il traduttore meccanico
ed il metodo per corrispondersi fra Europei conoscendo ciascuno solo la propria
lingua: Parte I", in Salerno (Italy), in 1931. This study illustrates how AI
breathes new life into the system of international keys and ideograms devised
by Pucci to translate from/into any Romance language (at least as a first
step). The methodology involves having the AIs retranslate, following Pucci's
method, the two text excerpts originally translated in 1931 and clearly
documented in his publication: a passage from Dante's La Vita Nuova, translated
from Italian into French, and a passage from Voltaire's Zadig, translated from
French into Italian. The result is notable: the two texts, translated 94 years
apart using the same method--by Pucci in 1931 and by AIs in 2025--show a low
average difference, with only minor variations observed. With Pucci's system
thus validated, it became feasible to have the AIs reproduce the excerpts in
English, Spanish, and German according to his method. The results were
consistent, and Pucci--via Artificial Intelligence--was tasked with translating
more modern and technical texts, thereby reviving, nearly a century later, an
invention that had remained almost entirely unknown and never applied beyond
its creator, now brought to wider attention and opened to possible
experimentation. Such a demonstration would not only affirm Pucci's historical
status but also place him among the precursors and intellectual contributors to
machine translation, whose work merits examination alongside figures such as
Troyanskij, Booth, and Weaver, with possible consequences for how the history
of the field is understood.

### [132] [Top-H Decoding: Adapting the Creativity and Coherence with Bounded Entropy in Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02510)
*Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo,Seyedarmin Azizi,Souvik Kundu,Massoud Pedram*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Top-H decoding is a new sampling method that better balances diversity and coherence in LLM text generation by effectively incorporating model confidence through entropy-constrained optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling techniques like temperature scaling, top-p, and min-p sampling struggle to properly incorporate model confidence information, often relying on limited heuristics that underutilize the full probability distribution.

Method: The authors formulate an entropy-constrained minimum divergence problem, prove it's equivalent to an NP-hard entropy-constrained mass maximization problem, and develop top-H decoding as a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve it.

Result: Top-H outperforms min-p sampling by up to 25.63% on creative writing benchmarks while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets like GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. LLM-as-judge evaluation confirms it produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures.

Conclusion: Top-H decoding advances state-of-the-art in open-ended text generation, effectively balancing creativity and coherence, and can be easily integrated into creative writing applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a
wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in
open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving
logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including
temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim
to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in
the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the
corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a
single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the
information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of
the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We
first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity
and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained
minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be
equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem,
which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally
efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical
evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA)
alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing
benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as
GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms
that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where
creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in
open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing
applications. The code is available at
https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

*Mayur Shirke,Amey Shembade,Pavan Thorat,Madhushri Wagh,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Code-mixed fine-tuned models (HingRoBERTa, HingBERT) outperform both non-code-mixed multilingual models and zero-shot LLMs like Google Gemini for Hindi-English NER tasks, demonstrating the importance of domain-specific pretraining for code-mixed text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NER in code-mixed text like Hinglish presents unique challenges due to informal structure, transliteration, and frequent language switching, requiring specialized approaches beyond standard multilingual models.

Method: Comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models (HingBERT, HingMBERT, HingRoBERTa), non-code-mixed multilingual models (BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa, MuRIL), and zero-shot LLMs (Google Gemini) on benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics.

Result: Code-mixed models, particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based models, achieved the best performance, outperforming both non-code-mixed models and Google Gemini. Non-code-mixed models showed limited adaptability, while Gemini exhibited competitive zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: Specialized code-mixed fine-tuned models are most effective for Hinglish NER tasks, though modern LLMs show promising generalization capabilities in zero-shot settings, highlighting the trade-off between domain specialization and generalization.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) in code-mixed text, particularly Hindi-English
(Hinglish), presents unique challenges due to informal structure,
transliteration, and frequent language switching. This study conducts a
comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed
multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained
on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained
on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google
Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER
tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using
Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models,
particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform
others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to
domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show
limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot
performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study
provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized
models for code-mixed NER tasks.

### [134] [Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522)
*Jiaming Li,Longze Chen,Ze Gong,Yukun Chen,Lu Wang,Wanwei He,Run Luo,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PACS is a novel RLVR framework that reformulates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards as a supervised learning task, achieving implicit actor-critic coupling for more stable training and superior performance on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in RL-based approaches, which limits their effectiveness in improving LLM reasoning capabilities.

Method: PACS treats outcome rewards as predictable labels and reformulates RLVR as a supervised learning task using cross-entropy loss, achieving implicit actor-critic coupling through a score function parameterized by the policy model.

Result: PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines like PPO and GRPO, achieving 59.78% at pass@256 on AIME 2025 with improvements of 13.32 and 14.36 points over the baselines respectively.

Conclusion: The supervised learning formulation provides a simple yet powerful framework for LLM post-training with verifiable rewards, offering more stable and efficient training while recovering classical policy gradient updates implicitly.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have
empowered large language models (LLMs) to tackle challenging reasoning tasks
such as mathematics and programming. RLVR leverages verifiable outcome rewards
to guide policy optimization, enabling LLMs to progressively improve output
quality in a grounded and reliable manner. Despite its promise, the RLVR
paradigm poses significant challenges, as existing methods often suffer from
sparse reward signals and unstable policy gradient updates, particularly in
RL-based approaches. To address the challenges, we propose $\textbf{PACS}$, a
novel RLVR framework that achieves im$\textbf{P}$licit $\textbf{A}$ctor
$\textbf{C}$ritic coupling via a $\textbf{S}$upervised learning framework. By
treating the outcome reward as a predictable label, we reformulate the RLVR
problem into a supervised learning task over a score function parameterized by
the policy model and optimized using cross-entropy loss. A detailed gradient
analysis shows that this supervised formulation inherently recovers the
classical policy gradient update while implicitly coupling actor and critic
roles, yielding more stable and efficient training. Benchmarking on challenging
mathematical reasoning tasks, PACS outperforms strong RLVR baselines, such as
PPO and GRPO, achieving superior reasoning performance. For instance, PACS
achieves 59.78\% at pass@256 on AIME 2025, representing improvements of 13.32
and 14.36 points over PPO and GRPO. This simple yet powerful framework offers a
promising avenue for LLMs post-training with verifiable rewards. Our code and
data are available as open source at https://github.com/ritzz-ai/PACS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Monolingual ASR models with 27M parameters outperform multilingual counterparts when trained on balanced high-quality data mix, achieving 48% lower error rates than Whisper Tiny and matching larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the assumption that multilingual ASR models always outperform monolingual ones, particularly for underrepresented languages and small model sizes.

Method: Train monolingual systems on carefully balanced mix of high-quality human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data for 27M parameter models.

Result: Models achieve error rates 48% lower than Whisper Tiny, outperform 9x larger Whisper Small, and match/outperform 28x larger Whisper Medium model.

Conclusion: Monolingual training with quality data enables superior on-device ASR for underrepresented languages, advancing state-of-the-art for small models.

Abstract: We present the Flavors of Moonshine, a suite of tiny automatic speech
recognition (ASR) models specialized for a range of underrepresented languages.
Prevailing wisdom suggests that multilingual ASR models outperform monolingual
counterparts by exploiting cross-lingual phonetic similarities. We challenge
this assumption, showing that for sufficiently small models (27M parameters),
training monolingual systems on a carefully balanced mix of high-quality
human-labeled, pseudo-labeled, and synthetic data yields substantially superior
performance. On average, our models achieve error rates 48% lower than the
comparably sized Whisper Tiny model, outperform the 9x larger Whisper Small
model, and in most cases match or outperform the 28x larger Whisper Medium
model. These results advance the state of the art for models of this size,
enabling accurate on-device ASR for languages that previously had limited
support. We release Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Ukrainian, and
Vietnamese Moonshine models under a permissive open-source license.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DARLING is a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes for both response quality and semantic diversity in LLMs, addressing the diversity loss problem in post-training while maintaining or improving response quality across various tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training of LLMs prioritizes accuracy and helpfulness at the expense of diversity, limiting their usefulness in creative and exploratory tasks like brainstorming and problem solving.

Method: Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING) with a learned partition function to measure semantic diversity beyond lexical variations, combined with quality reward during online RL.

Result: Outperforms quality-only RL baselines on non-verifiable tasks (instruction following, creative writing) and achieves higher pass@1 and pass@k on verifiable tasks (competition math), producing outputs with higher quality and novelty.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, leading to higher-quality responses while maintaining semantic diversity across different task types and model sizes.

Abstract: Post-training of Large Language Models (LMs) often prioritizes accuracy and
helpfulness at the expense of diversity. This creates a tension: while
post-training improves response quality, it also sharpens output distributions
and reduces the range of ideas, limiting the usefulness of LMs in creative and
exploratory tasks such as brainstorming, storytelling, or problem solving. We
address this challenge with Diversity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (DARLING), a
framework that jointly optimizes for response quality and semantic diversity.
At its core, DARLING introduces a learned partition function to measure
diversity beyond surface-level lexical variations. This diversity signal is
then combined with a quality reward during online reinforcement learning,
encouraging models to generate outputs that are both high-quality and distinct.
Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that DARLING
generalizes to two regimes: non-verifiable tasks (instruction following and
creative writing) and verifiable tasks (competition math). On five benchmarks
in the first setting, DARLING consistently outperforms quality-only RL
baselines, producing outputs that are simultaneously of higher quality and
novelty. In the second setting, DARLING achieves higher pass@1 (solution
quality) and pass@k (solution variety). Most strikingly, explicitly optimizing
for diversity catalyzes exploration in online RL, which manifests itself as
higher-quality responses.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PalmX 2025 is the first shared task benchmarking LLM cultural competence in Arabic and Islamic cultures through multiple-choice questions, showing fine-tuning significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained on web data are skewed towards Western cultures, leading to diminished understanding of Arabic and Islamic communities, especially for under-represented topics.

Method: Created two subtasks with MCQs in Modern Standard Arabic covering General Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture across 22 Arab countries, with 26 and 19 teams participating respectively.

Result: Fine-tuning substantially boosted performance - top systems achieved 72.15% accuracy on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning was most effective.

Conclusion: Task-specific fine-tuning significantly improves LLM cultural competence, with parameter-efficient methods being particularly effective, though data augmentation utility varies by domain.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently reflect the vast data distributions
they encounter during their pre-training phase. As this data is predominantly
sourced from the web, there is a high chance it will be skewed towards
high-resourced languages and cultures, such as those of the West. Consequently,
LLMs often exhibit a diminished understanding of certain communities, a gap
that is particularly evident in their knowledge of Arabic and Islamic cultures.
This issue becomes even more pronounced with increasingly under-represented
topics. To address this critical challenge, we introduce PalmX 2025, the first
shared task designed to benchmark the cultural competence of LLMs in these
specific domains. The task is composed of two subtasks featuring
multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA): General
Arabic Culture and General Islamic Culture. These subtasks cover a wide range
of topics, including traditions, food, history, religious practices, and
language expressions from across 22 Arab countries. The initiative drew
considerable interest, with 26 teams registering for Subtask 1 and 19 for
Subtask 2, culminating in nine and six valid submissions, respectively. Our
findings reveal that task-specific fine-tuning substantially boosts performance
over baseline models. The top-performing systems achieved an accuracy of 72.15%
on cultural questions and 84.22% on Islamic knowledge. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning emerged as the predominant and most effective approach among
participants, while the utility of data augmentation was found to be
domain-dependent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMMKD is a knowledge distillation framework that creates lightweight image-text retrieval models by combining multi-modal feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation with modality decoupling, and adaptive optimization to reduce conflicts between teachers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLP models are too computationally heavy for mobile deployment, so there's a need for lightweight yet effective image-text retrieval models that maintain performance while reducing complexity.

Method: Uses feature fusion network to merge image-text features, employs multi-teacher distillation with pre-computed text features as class vectors, applies KL scatter for distribution matching, and implements adaptive dynamic weighting based on gradient space diversity.

Result: Achieves superior performance on three benchmark datasets while significantly reducing model complexity compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: AMMKD provides an effective and flexible framework for deploying lightweight image-text retrieval models on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: The success of large-scale visual language pretraining (VLP) models has
driven widespread adoption of image-text retrieval tasks. However, their
deployment on mobile devices remains limited due to large model sizes and
computational complexity. We propose Adaptive Multi-Modal Multi-Teacher
Knowledge Distillation (AMMKD), a novel framework that integrates multi-modal
feature fusion, multi-teacher distillation, and adaptive optimization to
deliver lightweight yet effective retrieval models. Specifically, our method
begins with a feature fusion network that extracts and merges discriminative
features from both the image and text modalities. To reduce model parameters
and further improve performance, we design a multi-teacher knowledge
distillation framework to pre-train two CLIP teacher models. We decouple
modalities by pre-computing and storing text features as class vectors via the
teacher text encoder to enhance efficiency. To better align teacher and student
outputs, we apply KL scatter for probability distribution matching. Finally, we
design an adaptive dynamic weighting scheme that treats multi-teacher
distillation as a multi-objective optimization problem. By leveraging gradient
space diversity, we dynamically adjust the influence of each teacher, reducing
conflicts and guiding the student toward more optimal learning directions.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMMKD
achieves superior performance while significantly reducing model complexity,
validating its effectiveness and flexibility.

algorithm performance and energy consumption. It proposes an innovative
two-dimensional sustainability evaluation system. Different from the
traditional single performance-oriented evaluation paradigm, this study
pioneered two quantitative indicators that integrate energy efficiency ratio
and accuracy: the sustainable harmonic mean (FMS) integrates accumulated energy
consumption and performance parameters through the harmonic mean to reveal the
algorithm performance under unit energy consumption; the area under the
sustainability curve (ASC) constructs a performance-power consumption curve to
characterize the energy efficiency characteristics of the algorithm throughout
the cycle. To verify the universality of the indicator system, the study
constructed benchmarks in various multimodal tasks, including image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and batch and online learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the system can provide a quantitative basis for
evaluating cross-task algorithms and promote the transition of green AI
research from theory to practice. Our sustainability evaluation framework code
can be found here, providing methodological support for the industry to
establish algorithm energy efficiency standards.

Method: Introduced MESTI to transform video sequences into single images preserving micro-movement characteristics, and developed MEGANet with Gradient Attention block to enhance fine-grained motion feature extraction.

Result: MESTI consistently improved performance when replacing inputs of existing MER networks. MEGANet with MESTI achieved highest accuracy to date on CASMEII and SAMM datasets, setting new benchmark.

Conclusion: MESTI is a superior input modality and MEGANet is an advanced recognition network that paves the way for more effective micro-expression recognition systems in various applications.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task due to the subtle
and fleeting nature of micro-expressions. Traditional input modalities, such as
Apex Frame, Optical Flow, and Dynamic Image, often fail to adequately capture
these brief facial movements, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this
study, we introduce the Micro-expression Spatio-Temporal Image (MESTI), a novel
dynamic input modality that transforms a video sequence into a single image
while preserving the essential characteristics of micro-movements.
Additionally, we present the Micro-expression Gradient Attention Network
(MEGANet), which incorporates a novel Gradient Attention block to enhance the
extraction of fine-grained motion features from micro-expressions. By combining
MESTI and MEGANet, we aim to establish a more effective approach to MER.
Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MESTI,
comparing it with existing input modalities across three CNN architectures
(VGG19, ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0). Moreover, we demonstrate that replacing
the input of previously published MER networks with MESTI leads to consistent
performance improvements. The performance of MEGANet, both with MESTI and
Dynamic Image, is also evaluated, showing that our proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art results on the CASMEII and SAMM datasets. The combination of
MEGANet and MESTI achieves the highest accuracy reported to date, setting a new
benchmark for micro-expression recognition. These findings underscore the
potential of MESTI as a superior input modality and MEGANet as an advanced
recognition network, paving the way for more effective MER systems in a variety
of applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to cubic memory scaling and significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. Existing methods struggle with these challenges.

Method: Treats voxels as tokens and uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures, extending discrete diffusion beyond sequential domains to spatially coherent 3D generation.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on Minecraft house structures from 3D-Craft dataset, producing realistic and coherent structures even with over 98% sparsity, outperforming prior baselines and auto-regressive formulations.

Conclusion: Discrete diffusion represents a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling, successfully addressing the challenges of memory scaling and class imbalance in sparse voxel generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult
due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the
significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold
Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel
structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete
diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete
diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains
such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on
Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that,
unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion
produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over
98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize
generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete
diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

### [144] [Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00108)
*Anas M. Ali,Anis Koubaa,Bilel Benjdira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SGLC framework for high-resolution image dehazing that combines global contextual understanding with local detail enhancement, showing significant PSNR improvements on high-res datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dehazing models struggle with high-resolution images, often requiring downsampling or patch processing which degrades performance due to inability to effectively combine global context with local details.

Method: SGLC framework with two components: Global Features Generator (GFG) for initial dehazing using broad contextual understanding, and Local Features Enhancer (LFE) for refining localized details and pixel-level features. Integrated with Uformer architecture and is model-agnostic.

Result: Experimental results show considerable improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) on high-resolution datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in addressing haze in large-scale imagery.

Conclusion: SGLC enables robust dehazing for high-resolution inputs by effectively capturing interplay between global appearance and local structure, with model-agnostic design allowing augmentation of any dehazing network.

Abstract: Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital
images, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in
the computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have
demonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated
high-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to
downsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads
to a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the
difficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with
localized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this
chapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local
Features Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for
high-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:
the Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The
GFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual
understanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary
output by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby
capturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To
evaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer
architecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on
high-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in
addressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is
model-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed
global-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners
can harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving
visual fidelity in high-resolution environments.

*Ivan Slootweg,Natalia P. García-De-La-Puente,Geert Litjens,Salma Dammak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First large-scale self-supervised model for kidney abnormality detection in drug safety studies, showing UNI foundation model features alone are insufficient but self-supervised methods can achieve better-than-chance performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kidney abnormality detection in preclinical drug development requires examining thousands of whole-slide images, which is time-consuming and costly. Most slides are normal, making automated detection valuable for efficiency.

Method: Used UNI foundation model features and tested a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier. Then applied self-supervised methods to the same features for abnormality detection across 158 drug safety assessment studies.

Result: KNN classifier performed at chance level, showing FM features alone are insufficient. Self-supervised method achieved AUC of 0.62 and negative predictive value of 89%, demonstrating better-than-chance performance.

Conclusion: Self-supervised methods show promise for detecting kidney abnormalities and could be developed to rule out normal slides, reducing costs and time in drug safety assessment studies.

Abstract: Kidney abnormality detection is required for all preclinical drug
development. It involves a time-consuming and costly examination of hundreds to
thousands of whole-slide images per drug safety study, most of which are
normal, to detect any subtle changes indicating toxic effects. In this study,
we present the first large-scale self-supervised abnormality detection model
for kidney toxicologic pathology, spanning drug safety assessment studies from
158 compounds. We explore the complexity of kidney abnormality detection on
this scale using features extracted from the UNI foundation model (FM) and show
that a simple k-nearest neighbor classifier on these features performs at
chance, demonstrating that the FM-generated features alone are insufficient for
detecting abnormalities. We then demonstrate that a self-supervised method
applied to the same features can achieve better-than-chance performance, with
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.62 and a
negative predictive value of 89%. With further development, such a model can be
used to rule out normal slides in drug safety assessment studies, reducing the
costs and time associated with drug development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-step text-to-image retrieval method that converts text queries to visual queries using diffusion models, then uses vision models for image similarity matching, outperforming text-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-and-language models like CLIP map text and images to distant regions in representation space, limiting retrieval performance for semantic category queries.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Transform text query into visual query using generative diffusion model, 2) Estimate image-to-image similarity with vision model. Includes aggregation network to combine multiple generated images and fuse similarity scores across modalities.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the approach consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively bridges the modality gap between text and images by leveraging generative models and vision encoders, achieving superior retrieval performance for semantic category queries.

Abstract: This work explores text-to-image retrieval for queries that specify or
describe a semantic category. While vision-and-language models (VLMs) like CLIP
offer a straightforward open-vocabulary solution, they map text and images to
distant regions in the representation space, limiting retrieval performance. To
bridge this modality gap, we propose a two-step approach. First, we transform
the text query into a visual query using a generative diffusion model. Then, we
estimate image-to-image similarity with a vision model. Additionally, we
introduce an aggregation network that combines multiple generated images into a
single vector representation and fuses similarity scores across both query
modalities. Our approach leverages advancements in vision encoders, VLMs, and
text-to-image generation models. Extensive evaluations show that it
consistently outperforms retrieval methods relying solely on text queries.

*Younggun Kim,Sirnam Swetha,Fazil Kagdi,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM benchmark and Safe-LLaVA dataset address biometric leakage in MLLMs by providing evaluation metrics and privacy-preserving training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes without explicit requests, raising privacy concerns in real-world applications.

Method: Introduce PRISM benchmark to assess biometric leakage and create Safe-LLaVA dataset by removing biometric information from LLaVA data.

Result: Evaluation reveals widespread biometric leakages across MLLMs; fine-tuning on Safe-LLaVA significantly reduces privacy violations.

Conclusion: PRISM and Safe-LLaVA establish new standards for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of multimodal language models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and
reveal sensitive biometric attributes - such as race, gender, age, body weight,
and eye color - even when such information is not explicitly requested. This
raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and
socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available
dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric
leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware
Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to
assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2)
implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic
faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA
datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and
instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first
privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing
explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations
on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes,
highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on
Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric
leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA & PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned
development and evaluation of MLLMs. The Safe-LLaVA dataset & PRISM benchmark
are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/kyh9191/Safe-LLaVA,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEME is a cross-modal alignment method that enhances vision-language models for embodied AI tasks by learning ego-centric world models with spatio-temporal reasoning capabilities, achieving 1-3% improvements in accuracy and exploration efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack adequate spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation capabilities for dynamic, open-set embodied tasks like navigation and question answering, due to insufficient modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world understanding.

Method: Proposes VEME framework with three components: 1) cross-modal alignment bridging objects, spatial representations and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues, 2) dynamic implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding for task-relevant memory recall, 3) instruction-based navigation framework using embodied priors for long-term planning.

Result: Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE show 1%-3% improvement in accuracy and exploration efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: The method successfully enhances reasoning and planning in dynamic environments by embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, addressing limitations of current VLMs in embodied intelligence tasks.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in
unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence.
While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene
understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to
dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question
answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained
spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we
propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization
in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model.
Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment
framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with
spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic,
implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant
geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and
reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and
efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic
experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in
dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate
1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phyllodes tumors are difficult to distinguish from benign fibroadenomas preoperatively, leading to unnecessary surgical excisions. Current diagnostic methods lack accuracy.

Method: Dual-branch neural network that extracts and fuses features from breast ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects. Used class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation to handle class imbalance and prevent data leakage.

Result: Multimodal method outperformed unimodal baselines. ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved best performance with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294 respectively.

Conclusion: Multimodal AI shows potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool that can reduce unnecessary biopsies and improve clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are
difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to
benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To
address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates
breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve
diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts
and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects
with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold
cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The
results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines
in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image
encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal
setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and
0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to
serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and
improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

performance by examining data quality (source and sample size), model
architecture (selection and fine-tuning), training strategies (augmentation,
normalization, and optimization), and ensemble predictions. This study
reproduces the experiments in a previous systematic comparison of neural

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FHT2SP algorithm combines fast computation with high accuracy for Hough Transform, achieving near-optimal complexity while maintaining constant-bounded error independent of image size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fast Hough Transform algorithms either have optimal complexity but poor accuracy that worsens with scale, or have good accuracy but near-cubic computational cost. There's a need for an algorithm that achieves both speed and accuracy.

Method: Builds on Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes beyond power-of-two constraints, and integrates it into the FHT2DT algorithm. Uses appropriate superpixel size selection to balance complexity and accuracy.

Result: Achieves near-optimal computational complexity O(wh ln³ w) while keeping approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size. Error is controllable via a meta-parameter.

Conclusion: FHT2SP successfully bridges the gap between fast but inaccurate and accurate but slow HT algorithms, providing both computational efficiency and constant-bounded accuracy for arbitrary image sizes.

Abstract: The Hough transform (HT) is a fundamental tool across various domains, from
classical image analysis to neural networks and tomography. Two key aspects of
the algorithms for computing the HT are their computational complexity and
accuracy - the latter often defined as the error of approximation of continuous
lines by discrete ones within the image region. The fast HT (FHT) algorithms
with optimal linearithmic complexity - such as the Brady-Yong algorithm for
power-of-two-sized images - are well established. Generalizations like $FHT2DT$
extend this efficiency to arbitrary image sizes, but with reduced accuracy that
worsens with scale. Conversely, accurate HT algorithms achieve constant-bounded
error but require near-cubic computational cost. This paper introduces $FHT2SP$
algorithm - a fast and highly accurate HT algorithm. It builds on our
development of Brady's superpixel concept, extending it to arbitrary shapes
beyond the original power-of-two square constraint, and integrates it into the
$FHT2DT$ algorithm. With an appropriate choice of the superpixel's size, for an
image of shape $w \times h$, the $FHT2SP$ algorithm achieves near-optimal
computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(wh \ln^3 w)$, while keeping the
approximation error bounded by a constant independent of image size, and
controllable via a meta-parameter. We provide theoretical and experimental
analyses of the algorithm's complexity and accuracy.

Conclusion: VLM-guided generative workflows show promise for advancing industrial computer vision beyond classical pipeline limitations, demonstrating superior performance with language-guided refinement.

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material
variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of
classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a
language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in
manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized
into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using
a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language
modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process
and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack
datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge
continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the
refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including
Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided
workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1
consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIMO is a novel transductive few-shot learning method for vision-language models that combines information-theoretic concepts with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transductive few-shot learning has been well-studied for vision-only models but is underdeveloped for vision-language models (VLMs), with only a few recent methods exploring this area, indicating the need for VLM-tailored approaches.

Method: Proposes Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss with three components: mutual information between vision inputs and textual class descriptions, KL divergence penalty from text-driven zero-shot predictions, and standard cross-entropy loss. Also explores parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies.

Result: LIMO outperforms recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. PEFT strategies provide substantial performance boosts.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates the effectiveness of information-theoretic approaches and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for transductive few-shot learning in vision-language models, showing strong potential for adapting subsets of model parameters in this setting.

Abstract: Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing
on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent
context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent
methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs
and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we
leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive
transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel
Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three
complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and
the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the
text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss
based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed
fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and
explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly,
we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of
adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot
setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms
the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields
significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphGen uses nuclear morphology and spatial organization features with contrastive learning to improve domain generalization in histopathology, making AI systems more robust to staining variations and institutional differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological cues like nuclear atypia and spatial organization that remain consistent across different institutions, while current ML systems struggle with domain shifts caused by variations in tissue preparation, staining, and imaging conditions.

Method: MorphGen integrates histopathology images, augmentations, and nuclear segmentation masks in a supervised contrastive learning framework. It aligns latent representations of images and nuclear masks to prioritize diagnostic features over domain-specific artifacts, and incorporates stochastic weight averaging for flatter minima and better generalization.

Result: The method shows improved out-of-distribution robustness, with attention maps revealing reliance on nuclear morphology, cellular composition, and spatial organization. It demonstrates resilience to image corruptions and adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: MorphGen successfully learns cancer representations that are resilient to domain shifts by explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial organization, addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for digital pathology.

Abstract: Domain generalization in computational histopathology is hindered by
heterogeneity in whole slide images (WSIs), caused by variations in tissue
preparation, staining, and imaging conditions across institutions. Unlike
machine learning systems, pathologists rely on domain-invariant morphological
cues such as nuclear atypia (enlargement, irregular contours, hyperchromasia,
chromatin texture, spatial disorganization), structural atypia (abnormal
architecture and gland formation), and overall morphological atypia that remain
diagnostic across diverse settings. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that
explicitly modeling biologically robust nuclear morphology and spatial
organization will enable the learning of cancer representations that are
resilient to domain shifts. We propose MorphGen (Morphology-Guided
Generalization), a method that integrates histopathology images, augmentations,
and nuclear segmentation masks within a supervised contrastive learning
framework. By aligning latent representations of images and nuclear masks,
MorphGen prioritizes diagnostic features such as nuclear and morphological
atypia and spatial organization over staining artifacts and domain-specific
features. To further enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate
stochastic weight averaging (SWA), steering optimization toward flatter minima.
Attention map analyses revealed that MorphGen primarily relies on nuclear
morphology, cellular composition, and spatial cell organization within tumors
or normal regions for final classification. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
of the learned representations to image corruptions (such as staining
artifacts) and adversarial attacks, showcasing not only OOD generalization but
also addressing critical vulnerabilities in current deep learning systems for
digital pathology. Code, datasets, and trained models are available at:

### [156] [Towards Adaptive Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00320)
*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Chenrui He,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A visual token pruning method for Large Multimodal Models that reduces computational costs by 88.9% while maintaining performance through mutual information-based pruning and diversity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models suffer from high computational and memory costs due to increased token counts during inference. Existing pruning methods have limitations including costly calibration and suboptimal importance metrics.

Method: Proposes visual-only token pruning that preserves cross-modal alignment using mutual information to remove semantically misaligned tokens, and maximizes intra-modal diversity through expected pairwise distance optimization with a greedy algorithm.

Result: Achieves 88.9% token reduction on LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B models while maintaining strong performance, resulting in 56.7% improvement in inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed visual token pruning strategy effectively reduces computational overhead while preserving both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity, making LMMs more efficient without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across
various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token
sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly
processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially
raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has
emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning
methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,
leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy
differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively
on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy
that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal
informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning
strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual
tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual
modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained
tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the
expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently
with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as
LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference
speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrared and visible image fusion research focuses on improving performance but neglects real-time applicability on devices. There's a need for fast fusion methods that work efficiently even on low-power mobile devices.

Method: Proposes a look-up table structure with low-order approximation encoding and high-level joint contextual scene encoding. Uses efficient LUT distillation strategy instead of traditional quantization methods, integrating multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) performance into MM-LUT model.

Result: Achieves less than one-tenth the time of current lightweight SOTA fusion algorithms. Ensures high operational speed across various scenarios, including low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate superiority, reliability, and stability.

Conclusion: LUT-Fuse provides a breakthrough in efficiency and performance for infrared and visible image fusion, enabling real-time applications on resource-constrained devices while maintaining high fusion quality.

Abstract: Current advanced research on infrared and visible image fusion primarily
focuses on improving fusion performance, often neglecting the applicability on
real-time fusion devices. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that
towards extremely fast fusion via distillation to learnable lookup tables
specifically designed for image fusion, termed as LUT-Fuse. Firstly, we develop
a look-up table structure that utilizing low-order approximation encoding and
high-level joint contextual scene encoding, which is well-suited for
multi-modal fusion. Moreover, given the lack of ground truth in multi-modal
image fusion, we naturally proposed the efficient LUT distillation strategy
instead of traditional quantization LUT methods. By integrating the performance
of the multi-modal fusion network (MM-Net) into the MM-LUT model, our method
achieves significant breakthroughs in efficiency and performance. It typically
requires less than one-tenth of the time compared to the current lightweight
SOTA fusion algorithms, ensuring high operational speed across various
scenarios, even in low-power mobile devices. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority, reliability, and stability of our fusion approach. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TO-SDG framework that uses target domain textual descriptions (without target data) to improve single domain generalization via STAR module that aligns source features with target semantics using CLIP embeddings and spectral projection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDG methods neglect available textual descriptions of target deployment environments, which could guide model generalization without requiring target data.

Method: STAR module: uses target-anchored subspace from text embeddings to recenter image features, spectral projection to retain target-aligned directions, vision-language distillation to align features with VLM geometry, and feature-space Mixup for smooth transitions.

Result: Superior performance across various image classification and object detection benchmarks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: Minimal textual metadata significantly enhances generalization under data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target environments with unseen data.

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically
under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization
(SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning
invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual
descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented
Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the
textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to
guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget
Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into
source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR
uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target
description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then
utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues
while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language
distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR
further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source
and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image
classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority.
This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and
often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe
data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target
environments with unseen data.

### [161] [Iterative Low-rank Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00356)
*Jin Ye,Fengchao Xiong,Jun Zhou,Yuntao Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ILRNet is a novel iterative low-rank network that combines model-driven and data-driven approaches for hyperspectral image denoising, achieving state-of-the-art performance through wavelet domain processing and adaptive singular value thresholding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral image denoising is crucial for subsequent tasks, and while clean HSIs reside in low-dimensional subspaces with low-rank properties, it's challenging to effectively use these physical properties while preserving image details.

Method: ILRNet integrates a rank minimization module within U-Net architecture, transforming features to wavelet domain and applying singular value thresholding to low-frequency components. It features adaptive parameter learning and iterative refinement that combines intermediate results with noisy inputs.

Result: Experimental results show ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ILRNet effectively leverages spectral low-rankness in feature domain through adaptive learning and iterative refinement, providing superior denoising while preserving image details.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for
subsequent tasks. The clean HSI usually reside in a low-dimensional subspace,
which can be captured by low-rank and sparse representation, known as the
physical prior of HSI. It is generally challenging to adequately use such
physical properties for effective denoising while preserving image details.
This paper introduces a novel iterative low-rank network (ILRNet) to address
these challenges. ILRNet integrates the strengths of model-driven and
data-driven approaches by embedding a rank minimization module (RMM) within a
U-Net architecture. This module transforms feature maps into the wavelet domain
and applies singular value thresholding (SVT) to the low-frequency components
during the forward pass, leveraging the spectral low-rankness of HSIs in the
feature domain. The parameter, closely related to the hyperparameter of the
singular vector thresholding algorithm, is adaptively learned from the data,
allowing for flexible and effective capture of low-rankness across different
scenarios. Additionally, ILRNet features an iterative refinement process that
adaptively combines intermediate denoised HSIs with noisy inputs. This manner
ensures progressive enhancement and superior preservation of image details.
Experimental results demonstrate that ILRNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both synthetic and real-world noise removal tasks.

Conclusion: SurgLLM effectively addresses spatial and temporal challenges in surgical video understanding, providing a versatile solution for Computer-Assisted Surgery systems with enhanced performance across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted
Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two
major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and
insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development
of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an
effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video
understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness.
Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise
Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video
encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video
Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate
surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware
Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved
multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of
surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble
to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM.
Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks,
including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness

*Guangzong Si,Hao Yin,Xianfei Li,Qing Ding,Wenlong Liao,Tao He,Pai Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper challenges the common assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations in MLLMs share the same cause, proposing instead that they have distinct origins and introducing VPFC as a targeted mitigation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for addressing object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models fail because they incorrectly assume omission and fabrication hallucinations have a common cause, leading to trade-offs where reducing omissions increases fabrications.

Method: The authors propose Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method based on their Visual-Semantic Attention Potential Field framework, which reveals how models construct visual evidence for object presence/absence.

Result: VPFC effectively reduces omission hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations, demonstrating that the two types of hallucinations have distinct causes that require different mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: The research reveals a critical oversight in current object hallucination research and provides new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination mitigation strategies by addressing omission and fabrication hallucinations separately.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive advances,
yet object hallucination remains a persistent challenge. Existing methods,
based on the flawed assumption that omission and fabrication hallucinations
share a common cause, often reduce omissions only to trigger more fabrications.
In this work, we overturn this view by demonstrating that omission
hallucinations arise from insufficient confidence when mapping perceived visual
features to linguistic expressions, whereas fabrication hallucinations result
from spurious associations within the cross-modal representation space due to
statistical biases in the training corpus. Building on findings from visual
attention intervention experiments, we propose the Visual-Semantic Attention
Potential Field, a conceptual framework that reveals how the model constructs
visual evidence to infer the presence or absence of objects. Leveraging this
insight, we introduce Visual Potential Field Calibration (VPFC), a
plug-and-play hallucination mitigation method that effectively reduces omission
hallucinations without introducing additional fabrication hallucinations. Our
findings reveal a critical oversight in current object hallucination research
and chart new directions for developing more robust and balanced hallucination
mitigation strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPO-VLM is a two-stage defense framework that combines activation steering and policy optimization to protect Vision Language Models from adversarial attacks while maintaining visual grounding performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and existing defense methods using task-specific contrastive prompts have suboptimal performance and degrade visual grounding capabilities.

Method: Two-stage approach: Stage I computes adaptive layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources to suppress harmful behaviors. Stage II refines these vectors through sequence-level preference optimization with toxicity assessment and visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment.

Result: SPO-VLM enhances safety against attacks through activation steering and preference optimization while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without compromising visual understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework effectively balances efficiency and effectiveness, providing robust defense against adversarial attacks while preserving the VLM's core visual-textual integration capabilities.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but
remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has
emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific
contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal
performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these
limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM
(\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines
activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model
robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering
vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful
behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering
vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage
integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards
based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded
text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and
effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with
deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM
enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference
optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without
compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model
weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APPT method enables direct 3D point cloud processing by fine-tuning pre-trained models with minimal parameters, using point embeddings and permutation-invariant features to preserve spatial geometries without heterogeneous mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of applying pre-trained foundation models to 3D point cloud analysis due to data scarcity and the limitations of existing "high-to-low" mapping approaches that lose spatial geometries.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) that converts point clouds into embeddings with local geometry aggregation, uses permutation-invariant features for relative positions, and employs a weight-sharing prompt generator to calibrate self-attention across modalities.

Result: Enables direct point cloud processing without heterogeneous mappings, preserves spatial geometries, and reduces computational overhead while maintaining model performance.

Conclusion: APPT provides a generalizable framework for adapting any modality foundation model to 3D point cloud analysis with parameter efficiency and preserved spatial information.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for foundation models in 1D
textual and 2D visual analysis have demonstrated remarkable efficacy. However,
due to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a
challenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual
models to 3D domains through "high-to-low" mapping, these approaches often lead
to the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for
adapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly
leverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any
modality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive
Point-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a
modest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without
heterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by
aggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear
layers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the
inherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of
images and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the
relative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched
with location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate
self-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce
computational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights
with the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without
adding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen
foundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating
for the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoiseCutMix: A novel data augmentation method that combines CutMix with diffusion models to generate natural, high-resolution images with fused characteristics from two classes by partially combining estimated noise during the diffusion process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional class-combining augmentation methods like CutMix often produce unnatural boundaries due to contextual differences between images. The authors aim to leverage diffusion models' ability to generate natural, high-resolution images while maintaining the diversity benefits of CutMix-style augmentation.

Method: The proposed NoiseCutMix method partially combines the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes in a diffusion model. This allows for natural fusion of characteristics from both classes while avoiding the unnatural boundaries that plague traditional CutMix approaches.

Result: The method was evaluated through classification experiments and compared against conventional data augmentation techniques, random image generation using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: NoiseCutMix successfully addresses the limitations of traditional class-combining augmentation methods by integrating CutMix concepts with diffusion models, producing natural, high-resolution augmented images that preserve fused characteristics from multiple classes.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method that introduces
the concept of CutMix into the generation process of diffusion models, thereby
exploiting both the ability of diffusion models to generate natural and
high-resolution images and the characteristic of CutMix, which combines
features from two classes to create diverse augmented data. Representative data
augmentation methods for combining images from multiple classes include CutMix
and MixUp. However, techniques like CutMix often result in unnatural boundaries
between the two images due to contextual differences. Therefore, in this study,
we propose a method, called NoiseCutMix, to achieve natural, high-resolution
image generation featuring the fused characteristics of two classes by
partially combining the estimated noise corresponding to two different classes
in a diffusion model. In the classification experiments, we verified the
effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with conventional data
augmentation techniques that combine multiple classes, random image generation
using Stable Diffusion, and combinations of these methods. Our codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two crossmodal knowledge distillation methods (UDAKD and FSKD) to transfer knowledge from 2D image models to 3D LiDAR segmentation without requiring 3D annotations, leveraging synchronized camera-LiDAR data in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce the high cost and time investment of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds for semantic segmentation by leveraging abundant real-world image datasets and crossmodal knowledge transfer.

Method: Two crossmodal knowledge distillation approaches: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge Distillation (FSKD). Uses pretrained 2D image models on unlabeled 2D data and aligns 3D network outputs with corresponding 2D network points through known 2D-3D correspondence. Employs self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds for domain adaptation.

Result: The proposed methods consistently surpass state-of-the-art approaches in performance, validating their effectiveness for 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation without 3D annotations.

Conclusion: Crossmodal knowledge distillation successfully enables 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation by transferring knowledge from 2D image models, eliminating the need for costly 3D annotations while achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR data plays a pivotal role in autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches rely on extensive annotated data for point
cloud analysis, incurring high costs and time investments. In contrast,
realworld image datasets offer abundant availability and substantial scale. To
mitigate the burden of annotating 3D LiDAR point clouds, we propose two
crossmodal knowledge distillation methods: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Knowledge Distillation (UDAKD) and Feature and Semantic-based Knowledge
Distillation (FSKD). Leveraging readily available spatio-temporally
synchronized data from cameras and LiDARs in autonomous driving scenarios, we
directly apply a pretrained 2D image model to unlabeled 2D data. Through
crossmodal knowledge distillation with known 2D-3D correspondence, we actively
align the output of the 3D network with the corresponding points of the 2D
network, thereby obviating the necessity for 3D annotations. Our focus is on
preserving modality-general information while filtering out modality-specific
details during crossmodal distillation. To achieve this, we deploy
self-calibrated convolution on 3D point clouds as the foundation of our domain
adaptation module. Rigorous experimentation validates the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, consistently surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art
approaches in the field.

### [169] [Visually Grounded Narratives: Reducing Cognitive Burden in Researcher-Participant Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00381)
*Runtong Wu,Jiayao Song,Fei Teng,Xianhao Ren,Yuyan Gao,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAME is a novel paradigm that transforms research documents into coherent story images to reduce cognitive burden in narrative inquiry, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the immense burden of data analysis in narrative inquiry where researchers transform various data into hand-drafted narratives and participants engage in member checking with large document volumes.

Method: Proposed NAME paradigm with actor location and shape module for plausible image generation, and developed evaluation metrics for perceptual quality and narrative consistency.

Result: Achieved significant improvements: reduced FID score from 195 to 152 using only 0.96% of data, and from 175 to 152 (70:30 split) and nearly halved from 96 to 49 (95:5 split). Scored 3.62 vs baseline 2.66 on new metric.

Conclusion: NAME successfully reduces cognitive burden in narrative analysis by generating coherent story images from research documents, demonstrating superior performance with minimal data requirements compared to traditional methods.

Abstract: Narrative inquiry has been one of the prominent application domains for the
analysis of human experience, aiming to know more about the complexity of human
society. However, researchers are often required to transform various forms of
data into coherent hand-drafted narratives in storied form throughout narrative
analysis, which brings an immense burden of data analysis. Participants, too,
are expected to engage in member checking and presentation of these narrative
products, which involves reviewing and responding to large volumes of
documents. Given the dual burden and the need for more efficient and
participant-friendly approaches to narrative making and representation, we made
a first attempt: (i) a new paradigm is proposed, NAME, as the initial attempt
to push the field of narrative inquiry. Name is able to transfer research
documents into coherent story images, alleviating the cognitive burden of
interpreting extensive text-based materials during member checking for both
researchers and participants. (ii) We develop an actor location and shape
module to facilitate plausible image generation. (iii) We have designed a set
of robust evaluation metrics comprising three key dimensions to objectively
measure the perceptual quality and narrative consistency of generated
characters. Our approach consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across different data partitioning schemes. Remarkably, while the baseline
relies on the full 100% of the available data, our method requires only 0.96%
yet still reduces the FID score from 195 to 152. Under identical data volumes,
our method delivers substantial improvements: for the 70:30 split, the FID
score decreases from 175 to 152, and for the 95:5 split, it is nearly halved
from 96 to 49. Furthermore, the proposed model achieves a score of 3.62 on the
newly introduced metric, surpassing the baseline score of 2.66.

### [170] [HERO-VQL: Hierarchical, Egocentric and Robust Visual Query Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00385)
*Joohyun Chang,Soyeon Hong,Hyogun Lee,Seong Jong Ha,Dongho Lee,Seong Tae Kim,Jinwoo Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERO-VQL is a novel method for egocentric visual query localization that uses top-down attention guidance and egocentric augmentation to handle viewpoint changes and occlusions in first-person videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Egocentric videos present challenges like frequent viewpoint changes, object appearance variations, and partial occlusions that make accurate object localization difficult for existing methods.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization (HERO-VQL) with two key components: Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) using class tokens and principal component scores, and Egocentric Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT) that enhances query diversity and simulates viewpoint changes.

Result: Extensive experiments on VQ2D dataset show that HERO-VQL significantly outperforms baseline methods in handling egocentric challenges.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses the unique challenges of egocentric visual query localization by drawing inspiration from human cognitive processes and incorporating robust attention mechanisms and augmentation strategies.

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the egocentric visual query localization (VQL), where
a model should localize the query object in a long-form egocentric video.
Frequent and abrupt viewpoint changes in egocentric videos cause significant
object appearance variations and partial occlusions, making it difficult for
existing methods to achieve accurate localization. To tackle these challenges,
we introduce Hierarchical, Egocentric and RObust Visual Query Localization
(HERO-VQL), a novel method inspired by human cognitive process in object
recognition. We propose i) Top-down Attention Guidance (TAG) and ii) Egocentric
Augmentation based Consistency Training (EgoACT). Top-down Attention Guidance
refines the attention mechanism by leveraging the class token for high-level
context and principal component score maps for fine-grained localization. To
enhance learning in diverse and challenging matching scenarios, EgoAug enhances
query diversity by replacing the query with a randomly selected corresponding
object from groundtruth annotations and simulates extreme viewpoint changes by
reordering video frames. Additionally, CT loss enforces stable object
localization across different augmentation scenarios. Extensive experiments on
VQ2D dataset validate that HERO-VQL effectively handles egocentric challenges,
significantly outperforming baselines.

### [171] [Double-Constraint Diffusion Model with Nuclear Regularization for Ultra-low-dose PET Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00395)
*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCDM is a parameter-efficient diffusion model for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction that uses frozen pre-trained weights with trainable double-constraint controllers to handle different dose levels without full retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultra-low-dose PET reduces radiation exposure but causes increased noise and reduced image quality. Existing methods lack flexibility for different dose levels and require extensive retraining.

Method: Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM) with frozen pre-trained diffusion model weights. Uses two trainable modules: Nuclear Transformer Constraint (NTC) for low-rank feature compression and Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC) to control the diffusion model using compressed features.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose reduction factors and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios. Effective even at ultra-low doses (1% of full dose) on UDPET and Clinical datasets.

Conclusion: DCDM provides flexible, parameter-efficient ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction with strong performance across varying dose levels without complete model retraining.

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction holds
significant potential for reducing patient radiation exposure and shortening
examination times. However, it may also lead to increased noise and reduced
imaging detail, which could decrease the image quality. In this study, we
present a Double-Constraint Diffusion Model (DCDM), which freezes the weights
of a pre-trained diffusion model and injects a trainable double-constraint
controller into the encoding architecture, greatly reducing the number of
trainable parameters for ultra-low-dose PET reconstruction. Unlike full
fine-tuning models, DCDM can adapt to different dose levels without retraining
all model parameters, thereby improving reconstruction flexibility.
Specifically, the two constraint modules, named the Nuclear Transformer
Constraint (NTC) and the Encoding Nexus Constraint (ENC), serve to refine the
pre-trained diffusion model. The NTC leverages the nuclear norm as an
approximation for matrix rank minimization, integrates the low-rank property
into the Transformer architecture, and enables efficient information extraction
from low-dose images and conversion into compressed feature representations in
the latent space. Subsequently, the ENC utilizes these compressed feature
representations to encode and control the pre-trained diffusion model,
ultimately obtaining reconstructed PET images in the pixel space. In clinical
reconstruction, the compressed feature representations from NTC help select the
most suitable ENC for efficient unknown low-dose PET reconstruction.
Experiments conducted on the UDPET public dataset and the Clinical dataset
demonstrated that DCDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on known dose
reduction factors (DRF) and generalizes well to unknown DRF scenarios, proving
valuable even at ultra-low dose levels, such as 1% of the full dose.

### [172] [DAOVI: Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00396)
*Ryosuke Seshimo,Mariko Isogawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DAOVI, a deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting that addresses distortion in equirectangular projection using geodesic distance motion evaluation and depth-aware feature propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional videos capture entire surroundings but often contain unwanted objects. Existing video inpainting methods don't handle the distortion in equirectangular projection of 360-degree videos.

Method: Introduces Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI) with two modules: temporal motion evaluation using geodesic distance in image space, and depth-aware feature propagation in feature space to handle geometric distortion.

Result: Experimental results show DAOVI outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in omnidirectional video inpainting.

Conclusion: The proposed DAOVI model effectively addresses the unique challenges of omnidirectional video inpainting by considering geometric distortion and achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a
variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their
wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This
problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal
of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency.
Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a
narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular
projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting,
called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI
introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image
space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature
propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the
geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

*Yushuo Chen,Ruizhi Shao,Youxin Pang,Hongwen Zhang,Xinyi Wu,Rihui Wu,Yebin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel framework using video generative model Human4DiT to reconstruct human avatars from monocular videos, generating additional supervision from alternative viewpoints to enhance details and reduce artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches struggle to capture fine-grained dynamic details and generate plausible novel viewpoints due to limited avatar model capacity and insufficient observational data from monocular videos.

Method: Leverages Human4DiT video generative model to generate human motions from alternative perspectives as additional supervision. Uses video fine-tuning to inject physical identity for consistent motion reproduction, and patch-based denoising for higher-resolution outputs with finer details.

Result: Outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in human avatar reconstruction from monocular videos, demonstrating effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Conclusion: The framework successfully overcomes limitations of previous methods by using generative models to provide additional supervision signals, enriching unseen region details and regularizing avatar representation to mitigate artifacts.

Abstract: We present a novel framework to reconstruct human avatars from monocular
videos. Recent approaches have struggled either to capture the fine-grained
dynamic details from the input or to generate plausible details at novel
viewpoints, which mainly stem from the limited representational capacity of the
avatar model and insufficient observational data. To overcome these challenges,
we propose to leverage the advanced video generative model, Human4DiT, to
generate the human motions from alternative perspective as an additional
supervision signal. This approach not only enriches the details in previously
unseen regions but also effectively regularizes the avatar representation to
mitigate artifacts. Furthermore, we introduce two complementary strategies to
enhance video generation: To ensure consistent reproduction of human motion, we
inject the physical identity into the model through video fine-tuning. For
higher-resolution outputs with finer details, a patch-based denoising algorithm
is employed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
recent state-of-the-art approaches and validate the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies.

*Lianyu Hu,Fanhua Shang,Wei Feng,Liang Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightVLM is a training-free method that accelerates Vision-Language Models by reducing tokens during encoding and compressing KV Cache during decoding, achieving significant speedups with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Vision-Language Models suffer from slow inference speeds due to high computational costs in both encoding and decoding stages, limiting their real-world deployment despite their capabilities.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Pyramid token merging during encoding to hierarchically reduce tokens while keeping dominant ones, 2) KV Cache compression during decoding to remove unnecessary caches and improve throughput.

Result: Achieves 100% performance with only 35% image tokens, 98% performance with 3% tokens. 2.02× throughput improvement, 3.65× prefilling time reduction, 3.21× inference time reduction for long sequences.

Conclusion: LightVLM enables efficient deployment of large VLMs by significantly accelerating inference while maintaining performance, making heavy models faster than smaller counterparts and facilitating practical applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LightVLM, a simple but effective method that can
be seamlessly deployed upon existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to greatly
accelerate the inference process in a training-free manner. We divide the
inference procedure of VLMs into two stages, i.e., encoding and decoding, and
propose to simultaneously accelerate VLMs in both stages to largely improve
model efficiency. During encoding, we propose pyramid token merging to reduce
tokens of different LLM layers in a hierarchical manner by finally only keeping
a few dominant tokens to achieve high efficiency. During decoding, aimed at
reducing the high latency of outputting long sequences, we propose KV Cache
compression to remove unnecessary caches to increase the network throughput.
Experimental results show that LightVLM successfully retains 100% performance
when only preserving 35% image tokens, and maintains around 98% performance
when keeping only 3% image tokens. LightVLM could 2.02$\times$ the network
throughput and reduce the prefilling time by 3.65$\times$. LightVLM also makes
large VLMs faster again by enabling a heavy model (e.g., InternVL2.5 26B) to
infer faster than significantly smaller models (e.g., InternVL2.5 8B),
hopefully facilitating the real-world deployment. When generating long text
sequences (e.g., 4096 tokens), LightVLM could reduce the inference time by
3.21$\times$, largely outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: Face-MoGLE is a novel diffusion transformer framework that enables precise semantic control over face generation through mask-conditioned latent factorization and a mixture of global/local experts with dynamic gating.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face generation approaches struggle with disentangling semantic controls from generation pipelines while maintaining photorealism, requiring a better architectural solution.

Method: Uses semantic-decoupled latent modeling with mask-conditioned space factorization, mixture of global and local experts for holistic and fine-grained control, and dynamic time-dependent gating network that evolves with diffusion steps.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in both multimodal and monomodal face generation settings with robust zero-shot generalization capability, providing high-quality controllable face generation.

Conclusion: Face-MoGLE offers a powerful and flexible solution for controllable face generation with strong potential in generative modeling and security applications.

Abstract: Controllable face generation poses critical challenges in generative modeling
due to the intricate balance required between semantic controllability and
photorealism. While existing approaches struggle with disentangling semantic
controls from generation pipelines, we revisit the architectural potential of
Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through the lens of expert specialization. This
paper introduces Face-MoGLE, a novel framework featuring: (1)
Semantic-decoupled latent modeling through mask-conditioned space
factorization, enabling precise attribute manipulation; (2) A mixture of global
and local experts that captures holistic structure and region-level semantics
for fine-grained controllability; (3) A dynamic gating network producing
time-dependent coefficients that evolve with diffusion steps and spatial
locations. Face-MoGLE provides a powerful and flexible solution for
high-quality, controllable face generation, with strong potential in generative
modeling and security applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in multimodal and monomodal face generation settings and its
robust zero-shot generalization capability. Project page is available at

*Lubin Gan,Xiaoman Wu,Jing Zhang,Zhifeng Wang,Linhao Qu,Siying Wu,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemaMIL introduces Semantic Reordering and Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module to improve WSI analysis with better accuracy and efficiency than attention-based MIL and transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Attention-based MIL methods overlook contextual relationships, transformers have quadratic computational cost and overfitting issues, and state space models lose histological meaning when shuffling patch order.

Method: Integrates Semantic Reordering (clusters and arranges semantically similar patches) with Semantic-guided Retrieval State Space Module (selects representative queries to adjust state space parameters for global modeling).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four WSI subtype datasets with fewer FLOPs and parameters compared to strong baselines.

Conclusion: SemaMIL effectively addresses limitations of existing MIL approaches by preserving histological context while maintaining computational efficiency and achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has become the leading approach for
extracting discriminative features from whole slide images (WSIs) in
computational pathology. Attention-based MIL methods can identify key patches
but tend to overlook contextual relationships. Transformer models are able to
model interactions but require quadratic computational cost and are prone to
overfitting. State space models (SSMs) offer linear complexity, yet shuffling
patch order disrupts histological meaning and reduces interpretability. In this
work, we introduce SemaMIL, which integrates Semantic Reordering (SR), an
adaptive method that clusters and arranges semantically similar patches in
sequence through a reversible permutation, with a Semantic-guided Retrieval
State Space Module (SRSM) that chooses a representative subset of queries to
adjust state space parameters for improved global modeling. Evaluation on four
WSI subtype datasets shows that, compared to strong baselines, SemaMIL achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer FLOPs and parameters.

TL;DR: SA-LDL algorithm addresses label ambiguity in age estimation through stage-wise adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, achieving competitive results on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label ambiguity poses significant challenges in age estimation, and existing methods overlook varying ambiguity degrees across different age stages.

Method: Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL) that analyzes embedding similarities to identify stage-wise ambiguity patterns, using adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss.

Result: Achieved MAE of 1.74 on MORPH-II and 2.15 on FG-NET datasets, demonstrating competitive performance.

Conclusion: SA-LDL effectively captures structured label ambiguity patterns, leading to more accurate and robust age estimation compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Label ambiguity poses a significant challenge in age estimation tasks. Most
existing methods address this issue by modeling correlations between adjacent
age groups through label distribution learning. However, they often overlook
the varying degrees of ambiguity present across different age stages. In this
paper, we propose a Stage-wise Adaptive Label Distribution Learning (SA-LDL)
algorithm, which leverages the observation -- revealed through our analysis of
embedding similarities between an anchor and all other ages -- that label
ambiguity exhibits clear stage-wise patterns. By jointly employing stage-wise
adaptive variance modeling and weighted loss function, SA-LDL effectively
captures the complex and structured nature of label ambiguity, leading to more
accurate and robust age estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SA-LDL achieves competitive performance, with MAE of 1.74 and 2.15 on the
MORPH-II and FG-NET datasets.

TL;DR: Proposes Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework that separates feature learning from flow estimation using a 3-layer ConvNet for better accuracy-efficiency trade-off in deformable image registration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in learning-based deformable image registration including computational complexity and handling large deformations, by analyzing how ConvNets influence registration performance.

Method: EOIR framework uses only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and 3-layer flow estimators to build Laplacian feature pyramid, progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under large-deformation model.

Result: Superior accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs across five datasets of different modalities and anatomical regions, with comparable accuracy but better efficiency/smoothness.

Conclusion: EOIR effectively addresses registration challenges by separating feature learning from flow estimation, achieving optimal trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency and smoothness.

Abstract: Learning-based techniques have significantly improved the accuracy and speed
of deformable image registration. However, challenges such as reducing
computational complexity and handling large deformations persist. To address
these challenges, we analyze how convolutional neural networks (ConvNets)
influence registration performance using the Horn-Schunck optical flow
equation. Supported by prior studies and our empirical experiments, we observe
that ConvNets play two key roles in registration: linearizing local intensities
and harmonizing global contrast variations. Based on these insights, we propose
the Encoder-Only Image Registration (EOIR) framework, designed to achieve a
better accuracy-efficiency trade-off. EOIR separates feature learning from flow
estimation, employing only a 3-layer ConvNet for feature extraction and a set
of 3-layer flow estimators to construct a Laplacian feature pyramid,
progressively composing diffeomorphic deformations under a large-deformation
model. Results on five datasets across different modalities and anatomical
regions demonstrate EOIR's effectiveness, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency and accuracy-smoothness trade-offs. With comparable
accuracy, EOIR provides better efficiency and smoothness, and vice versa. The
source code of EOIR will be publicly available on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoRewardBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal reward models in video understanding, covering perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety with 1,563 annotated samples and 28 model evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for multimodal reward models in video domain suffer from limited question diversity, lack of comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate coverage of different MRM types.

Method: Created VideoRewardBench through AI-assisted data pipeline with 1,563 annotated samples (video-text prompt, chosen response, rejected response), covering 4 core video understanding aspects. Evaluated 28 MRMs across generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar categories.

Result: Top-performing GPT-4o achieved only 57.0% accuracy, best open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B reached 53.3%. Key findings: RL-trained MRMs don't necessarily have better cross-modal generalization, most MRMs benefit from inference-time scaling, and video frame count affects different MRM types differently.

Conclusion: VideoRewardBench provides a challenging and valuable benchmark for advancing MRM evaluation and development in video domain, revealing significant performance gaps and important insights about MRM behavior.

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training,
inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing
response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video
domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of
comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types
of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first
comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding:
perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data
pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated
samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times
the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a
triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected
response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal
reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and
semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves
only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key
insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily
exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii)
except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model
capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in
input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We
believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for
advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

*Zhongmiao Qi,Yan Jiang,Bolin Zhang,Lijun Guo,Chong Wang,Qiangbo Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes STVH and M-STVH techniques for fine-grained video activity retrieval, capturing spatiotemporal evolution and multi-focused features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for granular activity retrieval in videos rather than entire video retrieval, as current methods cannot handle activity-level granularity in complex scenarios with explosive video data growth.

Method: STVH models individual object dynamics and group interactions through unified framework capturing spatiotemporal evolution. M-STVH enhances this with hierarchical feature integration and multi-focused representation learning to jointly focus on activity semantics and object visual features.

Result: Both STVH and M-STVH achieve excellent results in comparative experiments on publicly available datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques successfully solve the problem of fine-grained activity retrieval in videos by capturing both group activities and individual object features through spatiotemporal modeling and multi-focused representation learning.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly
retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks
can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity
granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal
interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified
framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group
interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual
features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval
scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it
may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH
(multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle
this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature
integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model
to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We
conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH
and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

*Nhat-Tuong Do-Tran,Ngoc-Hoang-Lam Le,Ian Chiu,Po-Tsun Paul Kuo,Ching-Chun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TRUST is a token-driven dual-stream framework for ultrasound image style transfer that preserves source content while transferring target domain style, improving downstream task performance by filtering relevant style features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unpaired image-to-image translation methods don't adequately filter style features for downstream tasks, causing translated images to be misaligned with task needs when ultrasound images from different devices have diverse styles.

Method: Proposes TRUST framework with Token-dRiven module that selects suitable target tokens from data and model perspectives, uses behavior mirror loss, and injects auxiliary prompts to match content representation with downstream behavior.

Result: Experimental results on ultrasound datasets show TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and downstream task performance.

Conclusion: TRUST effectively bridges the style gap in ultrasound images while preserving content integrity, making it suitable for improving downstream medical imaging tasks across different devices.

Abstract: Ultrasound images acquired from different devices exhibit diverse styles,
resulting in decreased performance of downstream tasks. To mitigate the style
gap, unpaired image-to-image (UI2I) translation methods aim to transfer images
from a source domain, corresponding to new device acquisitions, to a target
domain where a frozen task model has been trained for downstream applications.
However, existing UI2I methods have not explicitly considered filtering the
most relevant style features, which may result in translated images misaligned
with the needs of downstream tasks. In this work, we propose TRUST, a
token-driven dual-stream framework that preserves source content while
transferring the common style of the target domain, ensuring that content and
style remain unblended. Given multiple styles in the target domain, we
introduce a Token-dRiven (TR) module that operates from two perspectives: (1) a
data view--selecting "suitable" target tokens corresponding to each source
token, and (2) a model view--identifying ``optimal" target tokens for the
downstream model, guided by a behavior mirror loss. Additionally, we inject
auxiliary prompts into the source encoder to match content representation with
downstream behavior. Experimental results on ultrasound datasets demonstrate
that TRUST outperforms existing UI2I methods in both visual quality and
downstream task performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATGC method enables effective local model training using black-box AI APIs by dynamically selecting optimal input scales through attention-guided analysis, overcoming resolution sensitivity limitations in open-vocabulary models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of training local models using black-box AIaaS APIs that don't expose weights, training data, or logits, making current domain adaptation methods impractical.

Method: ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC) leverages DINOv2 attention maps with entropy scoring to dynamically select optimal input scales for black-box model inference, enabling effective pseudo-labeling for distillation.

Result: Substantial improvements in black-box supervision across multiple datasets using only one-hot API predictions, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer from black-box models.

Conclusion: ATGC successfully addresses the 'curse of resolution' in open-vocabulary models and enables practical black-box distillation with limited API access, making AIaaS more accessible for local model adaptation.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) democratizes access
to pre-trained models via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), but also
raises a fundamental question: how can local models be effectively trained
using black-box models that do not expose their weights, training data, or
logits, a constraint in which current domain adaptation paradigms are
impractical ? To address this challenge, we introduce the Black-Box
Distillation (B2D) setting, which enables local model adaptation under
realistic constraints: (1) the API model is open-vocabulary and trained on
large-scale general-purpose data, and (2) access is limited to one-hot
predictions only. We identify that open-vocabulary models exhibit significant
sensitivity to input resolution, with different object classes being segmented
optimally at different scales, a limitation termed the "curse of resolution".
Our method, ATtention-Guided sCaler (ATGC), addresses this challenge by
leveraging DINOv2 attention maps to dynamically select optimal scales for
black-box model inference. ATGC scores the attention maps with entropy to
identify informative scales for pseudo-labelling, enabling effective
distillation. Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements under black-box
supervision across multiple datasets while requiring only one-hot API
predictions. Our code is available at https://github.com/yasserben/ATGC.

*Ruitao Wu,Yifan Zhao,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework (LBD) that uses language semantics from CLIP to address catastrophic semantic entanglement in class-incremental semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CISS methods suffer from catastrophic semantic entanglement - prototype-feature entanglement and background-increment entanglement - due to semantic misalignment and dynamic data evolution during incremental learning.

Method: Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement (LBD) framework using CLIP's prior class semantics. Includes Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement (using text features as templates) and Manifold Mutual Background Disentanglement (multiple learnable prototypes with mask-pooling supervision). Enhanced with soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Pascal VOC and ADE20k datasets, particularly in multi-step scenarios.

Conclusion: LBD framework effectively addresses catastrophic semantic entanglement in CISS by leveraging language semantics for autonomous feature disentanglement, bridging the capability gap between dense and sparse tasks.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation (CISS) requires continuous learning
of newly introduced classes while retaining knowledge of past classes. By
abstracting mainstream methods into two stages (visual feature extraction and
prototype-feature matching), we identify a more fundamental challenge termed
catastrophic semantic entanglement. This phenomenon involves Prototype-Feature
Entanglement caused by semantic misalignment during the incremental process,
and Background-Increment Entanglement due to dynamic data evolution. Existing
techniques, which rely on visual feature learning without sufficient cues to
distinguish targets, introduce significant noise and errors. To address these
issues, we introduce a Language-inspired Bootstrapped Disentanglement framework
(LBD). We leverage the prior class semantics of pre-trained visual-language
models (e.g., CLIP) to guide the model in autonomously disentangling features
through Language-guided Prototypical Disentanglement and Manifold Mutual
Background Disentanglement. The former guides the disentangling of new
prototypes by treating hand-crafted text features as topological templates,
while the latter employs multiple learnable prototypes and mask-pooling-based
supervision for background-incremental class disentanglement. By incorporating
soft prompt tuning and encoder adaptation modifications, we further bridge the
capability gap of CLIP between dense and sparse tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on both Pascal VOC and ADE20k, particularly in
multi-step scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainFM is a modality-agnostic vision foundation model for brain imaging that handles diverse MR contrasts and protocols through novel training strategies, enabling robust performance across five fundamental tasks without modality-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learning-based approaches work well for calibrated imaging like CT but struggle with uncalibrated MR modalities due to sensitivity to contrast, resolution, and orientation differences, limiting real-world clinical applicability.

Method: Proposes 'mild-to-severe' intra-subject generation and 'real-synth' mix-up training strategy to make the model resilient to appearance variations. The foundation model handles five tasks: image synthesis (CT/T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI), anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical distance, bias field estimation, and registration.

Result: Evaluated on eleven public datasets, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. The model shows strong generalization across diverse clinical protocols.

Conclusion: BrainFM provides a versatile foundation model approach that overcomes modality-specific limitations, enabling broad clinical applicability without requiring task-specific or modality-specific tuning for various brain imaging tasks.

Abstract: Recent learning-based approaches have made astonishing advances in calibrated
medical imaging like computerized tomography (CT), yet they struggle to
generalize in uncalibrated modalities -- notably magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, where performance is highly sensitive to the differences in MR
contrast, resolution, and orientation. This prevents broad applicability to
diverse real-world clinical protocols. Here we introduce BrainFM, a
modality-agnostic, multi-task vision foundation model for human brain imaging.
With the proposed "mild-to-severe" intra-subject generation and "real-synth"
mix-up training strategy, BrainFM is resilient to the appearance of acquired
images (e.g., modality, contrast, deformation, resolution, artifacts), and can
be directly applied to five fundamental brain imaging tasks, including image
synthesis for CT and T1w/T2w/FLAIR MRI, anatomy segmentation, scalp-to-cortical
distance, bias field estimation, and registration. We evaluate the efficacy of
BrainFM on eleven public datasets, and demonstrate its robustness and
effectiveness across all tasks and input modalities. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) to improve fine-grained object detection by integrating global scene context with local features using cross-attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance on vehicle damage assessment tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-grained object detection in challenging domains like vehicle damage assessment is difficult even for human experts. While DiffusionDet advanced the field, its performance is limited by local feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios.

Method: Proposes Context-Aware Fusion (CAF) that uses cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context (captured by a separate dedicated encoder) with local proposal features, enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive environmental information.

Result: Experimental results show improvement over state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains.

Conclusion: The framework significantly enhances the generative detection paradigm by enabling object proposals to leverage comprehensive environmental context, addressing fundamental limitations of previous approaches in context-dependent scenarios.

Abstract: Fine-grained object detection in challenging visual domains, such as vehicle
damage assessment, presents a formidable challenge even for human experts to
resolve reliably. While DiffusionDet has advanced the state-of-the-art through
conditional denoising diffusion, its performance remains limited by local
feature conditioning in context-dependent scenarios. We address this
fundamental limitation by introducing Context-Aware Fusion (CAF), which
leverages cross-attention mechanisms to integrate global scene context with
local proposal features directly. The global context is generated using a
separate dedicated encoder that captures comprehensive environmental
information, enabling each object proposal to attend to scene-level
understanding. Our framework significantly enhances the generative detection
paradigm by enabling each object proposal to attend to comprehensive
environmental information. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement over
state-of-the-art models on the CarDD benchmark, establishing new performance
benchmarks for context-aware object detection in fine-grained domains

*Boyi Li,Ce Zhang,Richard M. Timmerman,Wenxuan Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGL-RSIS is a training-free framework that enables vision language models to perform remote sensing image segmentation by decoupling visual and textual inputs and aligning them at both local semantic and global contextual levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transferring vision language models from natural images to remote sensing segmentation is challenging due to limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural and RS imagery.

Method: Proposes a global-local decoupling module that separates text into class nouns and modifiers, partitions images into mask proposals, aligns features at local scale through context-aware cropping and RS-specific knowledge enrichment, and refines segmentation using Cross-Scale Grad-CAM at global scale.

Result: The framework enables open-vocabulary semantic segmentation and referring expression segmentation in remote sensing imagery without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: DGL-RSIS successfully bridges the domain gap for VLMs in remote sensing applications through innovative decoupling and alignment strategies, providing accurate and interpretable segmentation results.

Abstract: The emergence of vision language models (VLMs) has bridged vision and
language, enabling joint multimodal understanding beyond traditional
visual-only deep learning models. However, transferring VLMs from the natural
image domain to remote sensing (RS) segmentation remains challenging due to the
limited category diversity in RS datasets and the domain gap between natural
and RS imagery. Here, we propose a training-free framework, DGL-RSIS, that
decouples visual and textual inputs, performing visual-language alignment at
both the local semantic and global contextual levels through tailored
strategies. Specifically, we first introduce a global-local decoupling (GLD)
module, where text inputs are divided into local class nouns and global
modifiers using natural language processing (NLP) techniques; image inputs are
partitioned into a set of class-agnostic mask proposals via unsupervised mask
proposal networks. Second, visual and textual features are aligned at local
scale, through a novel context-aware cropping strategy for extracting image
patches with proper boundaries and introducing RS-specific knowledge to enrich
the text inputs. By matching the enhanced text features with mask-guided visual
features, we enable the mask classification, supporting open-vocabulary
semantic segmentation (OVSS). Third, at the global scale, we propose a
Cross-Scale Grad-CAM module to refine Grad-CAM maps using contextual
information from global modifiers. A subsequent mask selection module
integrates pixel-level Grad-CAM activations into the mask-level segmentation
output, such that accurate and interpretable alignment can be realized across
global and local dimensions for referring expression segmentation (RES).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ML models trained on unorthorectified satellite data achieve comparable methane detection performance to orthorectified data, while bypassing preprocessing steps and enabling faster onboard detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas requiring rapid detection for climate mitigation. Current methods rely on preprocessing steps like orthorectification, which adds complexity and delays detection.

Method: Introduces UnorthoDOS approach using unorthorectified hyperspectral data from EMIT sensor, training ML models to detect methane plumes without preprocessing steps like orthorectification or matched filters.

Result: ML models trained on unorthorectified data achieve performance comparable to orthorectified data. Models trained on orthorectified data outperform traditional matched filter baseline (mag1c).

Conclusion: Unorthorectified data can effectively replace orthorectified data for methane detection, enabling faster onboard processing and reducing downlink costs while maintaining detection performance.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change,
making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning
(ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing
downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane
detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as
orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to
enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these
preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We
find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to
those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an
orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter
baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets
comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the
Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at

TL;DR: MV-SSM introduces a Multi-View State Space Modeling framework for robust 3D human pose estimation that generalizes better to new camera configurations using state space modeling and grid token-guided scanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention-based transformers struggle with spatial arrangement modeling of keypoints, overfit to specific camera setups, and perform poorly in occluded scenarios and new camera configurations.

Method: Proposes a Multi-View State Space Modeling framework with Projective State Space (PSS) blocks that model joint spatial sequences at feature and keypoint levels, using Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS) instead of traditional Mamba scanning.

Result: Achieves significant improvements: +10.8 AP25 (+24%) on CMU Panoptic three-camera setting, +7.0 AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP (+38%) on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

Conclusion: MV-SSM demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-view 3D human pose estimation across diverse camera configurations and challenging scenarios.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in single-view 3D human pose
estimation, multi-view 3D human pose estimation remains challenging,
particularly in terms of generalizing to new camera configurations. Existing
attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial
arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they
tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training
data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this
study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named
MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the
joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from
multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State
Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial
arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's
traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning
(GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate
that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods: +10.8 on AP25 (+24%) on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU
Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 (+13%) on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP

TL;DR: Neural network approach for automatic jewelry identification and description using computer vision and image captioning, achieving over 90% accuracy across three hierarchical description levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Jewelry identification is challenging due to diverse styles, and current precise descriptions are limited to experts, while translators/interpreters need comprehensive understanding of jewelry items.

Method: Uses computer vision and image captioning techniques with neural networks to generate natural language descriptions at three hierarchical levels. Different architectures are employed to detect jewels and create varying detail descriptions, evaluated through comprehensive jewelry image database.

Result: Final model achieved captioning accuracy exceeding 90% after thorough evaluation of various image captioning architectures, with encoder-decoder model being particularly effective for descriptive captions.

Conclusion: The innovative approach successfully enables automatic jewelry identification and description, providing translators and interpreters with quick access to accurate jewelry information that emulates expert analysis.

Abstract: Identifying jewelry pieces presents a significant challenge due to the wide
range of styles and designs. Currently, precise descriptions are typically
limited to industry experts. However, translators and interpreters often
require a comprehensive understanding of these items. In this study, we
introduce an innovative approach to automatically identify and describe jewelry
using neural networks. This method enables translators and interpreters to
quickly access accurate information, aiding in resolving queries and gaining
essential knowledge about jewelry. Our model operates at three distinct levels
of description, employing computer vision techniques and image captioning to
emulate expert analysis of accessories. The key innovation involves generating
natural language descriptions of jewelry across three hierarchical levels,
capturing nuanced details of each piece. Different image captioning
architectures are utilized to detect jewels in images and generate descriptions
with varying levels of detail. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
in recognizing diverse types of jewelry, we assembled a comprehensive database
of accessory images. The evaluation process involved comparing various image
captioning architectures, focusing particularly on the encoder decoder model,
crucial for generating descriptive captions. After thorough evaluation, our
final model achieved a captioning accuracy exceeding 90 per cent.

TL;DR: FtZ framework combines multiple vision encoders to enhance fine-grained visual perception in multimodal LLMs, outperforming single-encoder approaches on challenging benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at semantic understanding but fail at basic visual tasks requiring precise detail perception due to reliance on single vision encoders optimized for high-level semantics.

Method: Introduces Fusion to Enhance (FtZ) framework that composes a semantic anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder using lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism.

Result: Significantly outperforms single-encoder baselines and existing fusion methods on TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet benchmarks requiring fine-grained visual understanding.

Conclusion: Composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective approach to overcome visual perception bottlenecks in MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for next-generation AI systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they
face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic
understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require
precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent
architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level
semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture
fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to
Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the
single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor
encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head
Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several
challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as
TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms
baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods.
This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient
and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current
MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems
with stronger perceptual capabilities.

*Weilong Yan,Xin Zhang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes STM strategy for weather-generalized monocular depth estimation using parameter-efficient fine-tuning of vision foundation models with minimal normal weather data


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions is challenging due to lack of reliable ground truth and domain gaps in synthetic data. Self-supervised methods fail due to violated photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios.

Method: Introduces Selecting-Tuning-Maintaining (STM) strategy that structurally decomposes pretrained weights using entropy-rank and stable-rank metrics. Adaptively selects rank numbers and task-aware singular directions for initialization, with principal direction regularization to preserve pretrained knowledge.

Result: Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmarks across diverse weather conditions show STM outperforms existing PEFT methods, full fine-tuning, methods trained with adverse synthetic data, and even depth foundation models.

Conclusion: The STM strategy enables effective weather-generalized depth estimation through parameter-efficient fine-tuning while preserving the strong generalization capability of pretrained vision foundation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal normal weather data.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation under adverse weather conditions (e.g.\ rain, fog,
snow, and nighttime) remains highly challenging due to the lack of reliable
ground truth and the difficulty of learning from unlabeled real-world data.
Existing methods often rely on synthetic adverse data with pseudo-labels, which
suffer from domain gaps, or employ self-supervised learning, which violates
photometric assumptions in adverse scenarios. In this work, we propose to
achieve weather--generalized depth estimation by Parameter--Efficient
Fine--Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), using only a small
amount of high--visibility (normal) data. While PEFT has shown strong
performance in semantic tasks such as segmentation, it remains underexplored
for geometry--centric tasks like depth estimation -- especially in terms of
balancing effective adaptation with the preservation of pretrained knowledge.
To this end, we introduce the Selecting--Tuning--Maintaining (STM) strategy,
which structurally decomposes the pretrained weights of VFMs based on two kinds
of effective ranks (entropy--rank and stable--rank). In the tuning phase, we
adaptively select the proper rank number as well as the task--aware singular
directions for initialization, based on the entropy--rank and full--tuned
weight; while in the maintaining stage, we enforce a principal direction
regularization based on the stable--rank. This design guarantees flexible task
adaptation while preserving the strong generalization capability of the
pretrained VFM. Extensive experiments on four real--world benchmarks across
diverse weather conditions demonstrate that STM not only outperforms existing
PEFT methods and full fine--tuning but also surpasses methods trained with
adverse synthetic data, and even the depth foundation model

*Xiyao Wang,Chunyuan Li,Jianwei Yang,Kai Zhang,Bo Liu,Tianyi Xiong,Furong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training multimodal critic models with reinforcement learning on preference data produces unified models that excel at both evaluation and generation tasks, challenging the conventional separation between critic and policy models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the entrenched convention that separates critic models (for evaluation) from policy models (for generation) in vision-language modeling, and explore whether critic training can produce models that perform well in both roles.

Method: Reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B) to create LLaVA-Critic-R1, then extend this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs to create LLaVA-Critic-R1+.

Result: LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges as both a top-performing critic and competitive policy model, achieving +5.7% average gain over base model across 26 benchmarks. LLaVA-Critic-R1+ achieves SoTA 71.9 on MMMU at 7B scale. Self-critique at test time yields +13.8% improvement on reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: RL training on critic data produces unified models that excel at both evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable, self-improving multimodal systems that challenge the traditional critic-policy separation.

Abstract: In vision-language modeling, critic models are typically trained to evaluate
outputs -- assigning scalar scores or pairwise preferences -- rather than to
generate responses. This separation from policy models, which produce the
responses, is so entrenched that critics are rarely considered for direct
policy use. In this work, we challenge this convention. We propose to
reorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals
and perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,
producing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference
judgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,
LLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a
competitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs
trained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding
benchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).
Extending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields
LLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing
critic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.
Finally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying
self-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five
representative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal
that RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both
evaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,
self-improving multimodal systems.

Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity, making long-range dependency modeling burdensome. Mamba offers low computational burden but cannot perform direct feature fusion.

Method: Designs preprocessing module for Mamba structure with CNN for multi-layer feature extraction. Creates cross-state module using Mamba operator for multimodal fusion. Combines Mamba and CNN advantages in backbone design.

Result: Outperforms Transformer results on MUUFL and Houston2018 datasets while reducing network training burden. Achieves stronger full-image understanding of HSI and LiDAR modalities.

Conclusion: CSFMamba successfully leverages Mamba's computational efficiency for multimodal remote sensing fusion, demonstrating superior performance with reduced computational requirements compared to Transformer-based approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion has made great progress in the field of remote sensing
image classification due to its ability to exploit the complementary
spatial-spectral information. Deep learning methods such as CNN and Transformer
have been widely used in these domains. State Space Models recently highlighted
that prior methods suffer from quadratic computational complexity. As a result,
modeling longer-range dependencies of spatial-spectral features imposes an
overwhelming burden on the network. Mamba solves this problem by incorporating
time-varying parameters into ordinary SSM and performing hardware optimization,
but it cannot perform feature fusion directly. In order to make full use of
Mamba's low computational burden and explore the potential of internal
structure in multimodal feature fusion, we propose Cross State Fusion Mamba
(CSFMamba) Network. Specifically, we first design the preprocessing module of
remote sensing image information for the needs of Mamba structure, and combine
it with CNN to extract multi-layer features. Secondly, a cross-state module
based on Mamba operator is creatively designed to fully fuse the feature of the
two modalities. The advantages of Mamba and CNN are combined by designing a
more powerful backbone. We capture the fusion relationship between HSI and
LiDAR modalities with stronger full-image understanding. The experimental
results on two datasets of MUUFL and Houston2018 show that the proposed method
outperforms the experimental results of Transformer under the premise of
reducing the network training burden.

TL;DR: CascadeFormer - a two-stage transformer framework with masked pretraining and cascading fine-tuning for skeleton-based action recognition, achieving competitive results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent advances in transformer models and masked pretraining offer new opportunities for representation learning in skeleton-based action recognition, which has been dominated by Graph Convolutional Networks.

Method: Proposes CascadeFormer - a family of two-stage cascading transformers with masked pretraining stage for learning generalizable skeleton representations, followed by cascading fine-tuning stage for discriminative action classification.

Result: Achieves competitive performance across three benchmark datasets: Penn Action, N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60.

Conclusion: The proposed CascadeFormer framework demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based approaches with masked pretraining for skeleton-based human action recognition, offering a viable alternative to dominant GCN architectures.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition leverages sequences of human joint
coordinates to identify actions performed in videos. Owing to the intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure of skeleton data, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
have been the dominant architecture in this field. However, recent advances in
transformer models and masked pretraining frameworks open new avenues for
representation learning. In this work, we propose CascadeFormer, a family of
two-stage cascading transformers for skeleton-based human action recognition.
Our framework consists of a masked pretraining stage to learn generalizable
skeleton representations, followed by a cascading fine-tuning stage tailored
for discriminative action classification. We evaluate CascadeFormer across
three benchmark datasets (Penn Action N-UCLA, and NTU RGB+D 60), achieving
competitive performance on all tasks. To promote reproducibility, we release
our code and model checkpoints.

*Raehyuk Jung,Seungjun Yu,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating projection-layer generalization in Vision-Language Models shows 79-88% performance retention on unseen classes, with mechanistic analysis revealing the projection layer functions like key-value memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite the importance of projection layers in VLMs that map visual features to language embedding space, their ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been systematically evaluated.

Method: Adapt object detection datasets into prompting format with disjoint train/test splits to control seen/unseen concept separation, and analyze through mechanistic interpretability.

Result: Projection layer retains 79-88% performance on unseen classes compared to seen ones, showing non-trivial generalization without explicit alignment supervision on those concepts.

Conclusion: The study introduces a new evaluation framework for alignment generalization and highlights potential for efficient VLM training with limited aligned data, as projection layers demonstrate significant generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) combine a vision encoder and a large language
model (LLM) through alignment training, showing strong performance on
multimodal tasks. A central component in this architecture is the projection
layer, which maps visual features into the LLM's embedding space. Despite its
importance, its ability to generalize to unseen visual concepts has not been
systematically evaluated. To address this, we propose a benchmark for
evaluating projection-layer generalization. We adapt object detection datasets
(rich in fine-grained annotations) into a prompting format and design
train/test splits with disjoint label sets, enabling precise control over seen
and unseen concept separation. Experimental results show that the projection
layer retains about 79 to 88 percent of the performance on unseen classes
compared to seen ones across various settings, suggesting a non-trivial level
of generalization even without explicit alignment supervision on those
concepts. We further analyze this behavior through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Our findings indicate that the feed-forward network in
the projection layer functions like a key-value memory, processing seen and
unseen tokens in similar ways. This study introduces a new evaluation framework
for alignment generalization and highlights the potential for efficient VLM
training with limited aligned data.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos,Tanaya Maslekar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that reduces skin tone bias by analyzing feature map skewness in VGG and Vision Transformer networks, focusing on lesion areas instead of skin color.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about potential biases related to skin color in deep learning models for skin lesion classification, which can impact diagnostic outcomes and equitable healthcare.

Method: Calculate skewness of feature maps in VGG network convolution layers and Vision Transformer patches/heads to identify and reduce unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing attention on lesion areas rather than skin color.

Result: The approach reduces computational costs, mitigates bias without conventional statistical methods, potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

Conclusion: Proposed method effectively addresses skin tone bias in medical AI systems by focusing on clinically relevant lesion features rather than skin color characteristics, improving fairness and practicality for healthcare deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of
skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting
equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related
to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is
challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational
demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these
challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that
overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across
varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the
convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches
and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary
channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This
approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on
conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while
maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

### [199] [Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00749)
*Sangyu Han,Yearim Kim,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaFE method uses input-attribution techniques with Effective Receptive Field to identify causal image patches that drive SAE feature activations in vision transformers, revealing hidden context dependencies that activation maps alone miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional inspection of SAE features by looking at highest-activation patches is misleading because self-attention mixes information across the entire image, causing activated patches to co-occur with but not necessarily cause feature firing.

Method: Proposes Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE) which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF) and applies input-attribution methods to identify image patches that causally drive specific SAE feature activations.

Result: ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies. Patch insertion tests confirm CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches.

Conclusion: CaFE provides more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, demonstrating the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location analysis.

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers
truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's
activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the
entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the
feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages
Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature
to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image
patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps
frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context
dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of
eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm
that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than
activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and
semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk
of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

TL;DR: A multi-stage retrieval framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model reranking, and multimodal matching achieves top performance in event-based image retrieval from free-form captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional vision-language retrieval approaches struggle with abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, and complex narratives in captions, requiring better understanding of latent event semantics and real-world knowledge.

Method: Multi-stage framework with dense article retrieval (Qwen3), event-aware language model reranking (Qwen3-Reranker), efficient image collection, caption-guided semantic matching, and rank-aware selection using Qwen2-VL for image scoring, fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion.

Result: Achieved top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: Combining language-based reasoning and multimodal retrieval is effective for complex, real-world image understanding in event-based retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Event-based image retrieval from free-form captions presents a significant
challenge: models must understand not only visual features but also latent
event semantics, context, and real-world knowledge. Conventional
vision-language retrieval approaches often fall short when captions describe
abstract events, implicit causality, temporal context, or contain long, complex
narratives. To tackle these issues, we introduce a multi-stage retrieval
framework combining dense article retrieval, event-aware language model
reranking, and efficient image collection, followed by caption-guided semantic
matching and rank-aware selection. We leverage Qwen3 for article search,
Qwen3-Reranker for contextual alignment, and Qwen2-VL for precise image
scoring. To further enhance performance and robustness, we fuse outputs from
multiple configurations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Our system achieves
the top-1 score on the private test set of Track 2 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand
Challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining language-based
reasoning and multimodal retrieval for complex, real-world image understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based pipelines struggle with cross-modal semantics in medical imaging, particularly for ENT endoscopy where limited data and the need to bridge visual inputs with textual diagnostic context pose challenges.

Method: Leverages CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone enhanced with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), multi-level CLS token aggregation, spherical feature interpolation, and class-specific natural language prompts. Uses joint training combining supervised classification with contrastive learning.

Result: Achieved 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of 0.93 (image-to-image) and 0.92 (text-to-image), MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Won ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand Challenge.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical settings, with ablation studies confirming the incremental benefits of each architectural component for ENT endoscopy analysis.

Abstract: We present a unified vision-language framework tailored for ENT endoscopy
image analysis that simultaneously tackles three clinically-relevant tasks:
image classification, image-to-image retrieval, and text-to-image retrieval.
Unlike conventional CNN-based pipelines that struggle to capture cross-modal
semantics, our approach leverages the CLIP ViT-B/16 backbone and enhances it
through Low-Rank Adaptation, multi-level CLS token aggregation, and spherical
feature interpolation. These components collectively enable efficient
fine-tuning on limited medical data while improving representation diversity
and semantic alignment across modalities. To bridge the gap between visual
inputs and textual diagnostic context, we introduce class-specific natural
language prompts that guide the image encoder through a joint training
objective combining supervised classification with contrastive learning. We
validated our framework through participation in the ACM MM'25 ENTRep Grand
Challenge, achieving 95% accuracy and F1-score in classification, Recall@1 of
0.93 and 0.92 for image-to-image and text-to-image retrieval respectively, and
MRR scores of 0.97 and 0.96. Ablation studies demonstrated the incremental
benefits of each architectural component, validating the effectiveness of our
design for robust multimodal medical understanding in low-resource clinical
settings.

TL;DR: First generalizable watermarking framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting models that embeds arbitrary messages through a single forward pass without fine-tuning, using GaussianBridge transformation and uncertainty-aware perceptual preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for effective copyright protection in 3DGS models, as current methods require computationally expensive fine-tuning for each predefined message.

Method: GaussianBridge transforms unstructured 3D Gaussians into Splatter Image format for neural processing. Uses Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction for imperceptibility and dense segmentation-based extraction for robust message recovery.

Result: Enables efficient watermarking through single forward pass, maintains visual quality, and provides reliable extraction even when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views.

Conclusion: Proposed framework provides the first generalizable solution for 3DGS watermarking that is efficient, imperceptible, and robust, addressing copyright protection needs without expensive per-message fine-tuning.

Abstract: The growing popularity of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has intensified the
need for effective copyright protection. Current 3DGS watermarking methods rely
on computationally expensive fine-tuning procedures for each predefined

efficient protection of Splatter Image-based 3DGS models through a single
forward pass. We introduce GaussianBridge that transforms unstructured 3D
Gaussians into Splatter Image format, enabling direct neural processing for
arbitrary message embedding. To ensure imperceptibility, we design a
Gaussian-Uncertainty-Perceptual heatmap prediction strategy for preserving
visual quality. For robust message recovery, we develop a dense
segmentation-based extraction mechanism that maintains reliable extraction even
when watermarked objects occupy minimal regions in rendered views. Project

### [203] [No More Sibling Rivalry: Debiasing Human-Object Interaction Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00760)
*Bin Yang,Yulin Zhang,Hong-Yu Zhou,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper identifies 'Toxic Siblings' bias in HOI detection transformers where similar triplets interfere with each other, and proposes two debiasing objectives that significantly improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detection transformers for human-object interaction (HOI) detection suffer from 'Toxic Siblings' bias where similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere and compete with each other, reducing precision as increased similarity causes confusion between sibling categories.

Method: Proposes two debiasing learning objectives: 1) 'contrastive-then-calibration' for input perspective - samples incorrect sibling-like HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones using positional priors; 2) 'merge-then-split' for output perspective - learns shared features among sibling categories first, then refines intra-group differentiation.

Result: Significantly outperforms both baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

Conclusion: The proposed debiasing methods effectively address the Toxic Siblings bias in HOI detection transformers, demonstrating substantial performance improvements by mitigating interference between similar triplets.

Abstract: Detection transformers have been applied to human-object interaction (HOI)
detection, enhancing the localization and recognition of human-action-object
triplets in images. Despite remarkable progress, this study identifies a
critical issue-"Toxic Siblings" bias-which hinders the interaction decoder's
learning, as numerous similar yet distinct HOI triplets interfere with and even
compete against each other both input side and output side to the interaction
decoder. This bias arises from high confusion among sibling
triplets/categories, where increased similarity paradoxically reduces
precision, as one's gain comes at the expense of its toxic sibling's decline.
To address this, we propose two novel debiasing learning
objectives-"contrastive-then-calibration" and "merge-then-split"-targeting the
input and output perspectives, respectively. The former samples sibling-like
incorrect HOI triplets and reconstructs them into correct ones, guided by
strong positional priors. The latter first learns shared features among sibling
categories to distinguish them from other groups, then explicitly refines
intra-group differentiation to preserve uniqueness. Experiments show that we
significantly outperform both the baseline (+9.18% mAP on HICO-Det) and the
state-of-the-art (+3.59% mAP) across various settings.

TL;DR: InterPose: A large-scale dataset of 73.8K human-object interaction motions extracted automatically from videos, enabling improved motion generation and zero-shot animation of diverse interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation works focus on isolated people in empty scenes, lacking realistic human-object interactions due to limited datasets with diverse object manipulations.

Method: Proposed an automatic motion extraction pipeline to collect interaction-rich human motions from 45.8K videos, creating InterPose dataset with 73.8K sequences and corresponding text captions.

Result: InterPose brings significant improvements to state-of-the-art human motion generation methods and enables development of an LLM-based agent for zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse objects and scenes.

Conclusion: The InterPose dataset successfully addresses the lack of large-scale human-object interaction data, enabling more realistic and versatile motion generation for complex 3D scenes.

Abstract: Human motion generation has shown great advances thanks to the recent
diffusion models trained on large-scale motion capture data. Most of existing
works, however, currently target animation of isolated people in empty scenes.
Meanwhile, synthesizing realistic human-object interactions in complex 3D
scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and robotics. One
obstacle towards generating versatile high-fidelity human-object interactions
is the lack of large-scale datasets with diverse object manipulations. Indeed,
existing motion capture data is typically restricted to single people and
manipulations of limited sets of objects. To address this issue, we propose an
automatic motion extraction pipeline and use it to collect interaction-rich
human motions. Our new dataset InterPose contains 73.8K sequences of 3D human
motions and corresponding text captions automatically obtained from 45.8K
videos with human-object interactions. We perform extensive experiments and
demonstrate InterPose to bring significant improvements to state-of-the-art
methods for human motion generation. Moreover, using InterPose we develop an
LLM-based agent enabling zero-shot animation of people interacting with diverse
objects and scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern face retrieval systems often outsource retrieval to third parties, risking user portrait privacy. Homomorphic encryption provides security but is computationally inefficient for real-time applications.

Method: Proposes a hierarchical two-stage framework: 1) high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing for fast candidate filtering, and 2) fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for precise face ranking. Includes tailored protection mechanism for cancelable biometric authentication.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the method achieves a decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Conclusion: The proposed Cancelable Product Quantization framework provides an efficient solution for secure face representation retrieval that addresses privacy concerns while maintaining practical performance.

Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of modern face retrieval systems, their retrieval stage
is often outsourced to third-party entities, posing significant risks to user
portrait privacy. Although homomorphic encryption (HE) offers strong security
guarantees by enabling arithmetic computations in the cipher space, its high
computational inefficiency makes it unsuitable for real-time, real-world
applications. To address this issue, we propose Cancelable Product
Quantization, a highly efficient framework for secure face representation
retrieval. Our hierarchical two-stage framework comprises: (i) a
high-throughput cancelable PQ indexing module for fast candidate filtering, and
(ii) a fine-grained cipher-space retrieval module for final precise face
ranking. A tailored protection mechanism is designed to secure the indexing
module for cancelable biometric authentication while ensuring efficiency.
Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an
decent balance between effectiveness, efficiency and security.

Motivation: To develop a more effective line segment detector that can extract complete line segments with high precision from images, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Uses hierarchical approach with regular anchors and aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors while updating predicted line segments, followed by simple validation and merging of adjacent segments.

Result: Quantitative experiments show AAGLSD effectively extracts complete line segments from input images and outperforms other advanced line segment detectors on various datasets.

Conclusion: AAGLSD provides an effective solution for precise and complete line segment detection with straightforward validation and merging, avoiding complex refinement strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel line segment detector, the Aligned Anchor
Groups guided Line Segment Detector (AAGLSD), designed to detect line segments
from images with high precision and completeness. The algorithm employs a
hierarchical approach to extract candidate pixels with different saliency
levels, including regular anchors and aligned anchor groups. AAGLSD initiates
from these aligned anchor groups, sequentially linking anchors and updating the
currently predicted line segment simultaneously. The final predictions are
derived through straightforward validation and merging of adjacent line
segments, avoiding complex refinement strategies. AAGLSD is evaluated on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel image-to-brain framework using diffusion models with cross-attention to generate biologically plausible brain signals for visual prostheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual prostheses struggle with generating brain signals that have sufficient biological similarity, lacking supervised signals from real brain responses to validate biological plausibility.

Method: Proposes a DDPM-based framework with cross-attention mechanisms, using a pre-trained CLIP visual encoder and cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model to reconstruct brain signals through iterative denoising.

Result: Evaluated on THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG datasets, demonstrating effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Visualized training and test M/EEG topographies to show intra-subject and inter-subject variations.

Conclusion: The cross-attention enhanced diffusion model framework successfully addresses the biological plausibility issue in brain signal generation for visual prostheses, enabling dynamic interaction between visual features and brain representations.

Abstract: Visual prostheses have shown great potential in restoring vision for blind
individuals. On the one hand, researchers have been continuously improving the
brain decoding framework of visual prostheses by leveraging the powerful image
generation capabilities of diffusion models. On the other hand, the brain
encoding stage of visual prostheses struggles to generate brain signals with
sufficient biological similarity. Although existing works have recognized this
problem, the quality of predicted stimuli still remains a critical issue, as
existing approaches typically lack supervised signals from real brain responses
to validate the biological plausibility of predicted stimuli. To address this
issue, we propose a novel image-to-brain framework based on denoising diffusion
probabilistic models (DDPMs) enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Our
framework consists of two key architectural components: a pre-trained CLIP
visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images,
and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that learns to reconstruct
biologically plausible brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike
conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for
conditioning, our cross-attention modules enable dynamic interaction between
visual features and brain signal representations, facilitating fine-grained
alignment during the generation process. We evaluate our framework on two
multimodal datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) to demonstrate its
effectiveness in generating biologically plausible brain signals. Moreover, we
visualize the training and test M/EEG topographies for all subjects on both
datasets to intuitively demonstrate the intra-subject variations and
inter-subject variations in M/EEG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models focus on static scene understanding but neglect the essential temporal dimension needed for real-world driving scenarios, creating a critical limitation in autonomous driving systems.

Method: Developed OmniReason-Data (large-scale VLA datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations) using hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling, and OmniReason-Agent architecture with sparse temporal memory module and explanation generator using spatiotemporal knowledge distillation.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering benchmarks, establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous vehicles.

Conclusion: OmniReason framework successfully addresses the temporal reasoning gap in autonomous driving through robust spatiotemporal modeling and interpretable decision-making, enabling better performance in complex dynamic environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive
spatial reasoning capabilities for autonomous driving, yet existing methods
predominantly focus on static scene understanding while neglecting the
essential temporal dimension of real-world driving scenarios. To address this
critical limitation, we propose the OmniReason framework, which establishes
robust spatiotemporal reasoning by jointly modeling dynamic 3D environments and
their underlying decision-making processes. Our work makes two fundamental
advances: (1) We introduce OmniReason-Data, two large-scale
vision-language-action (VLA) datasets with dense spatiotemporal annotations and
natural language explanations, generated through a novel
hallucination-mitigated auto-labeling pipeline that ensures both physical
plausibility and temporal coherence; (2) We develop the OmniReason-Agent
architecture, which integrates a sparse temporal memory module for persistent
scene context modeling and an explanation generator that produces
human-interpretable decision rationales, facilitated by our spatiotemporal
knowledge distillation approach that effectively captures spatiotemporal causal
reasoning patterns. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, where OmniReason-Agent achieves significant improvements in both
open-loop planning tasks and visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, while
establishing new capabilities for interpretable, temporally-aware autonomous
vehicles operating in complex, dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MI-RAG is a multimodal iterative retrieval-augmented generation framework that improves knowledge-intensive visual question answering by dynamically formulating multi-queries and refining reasoning across iterations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive visual questions requiring external knowledge beyond images, and conventional single-pass RAG frameworks often fail to gather sufficient knowledge.

Method: Proposes MI-RAG framework that uses iterative reasoning to enhance retrieval, formulates multi-queries from accumulated reasoning records, performs joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases, and synthesizes new knowledge into reasoning records.

Result: Significant improvements in both retrieval recall and answer accuracy on challenging benchmarks including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA.

Conclusion: MI-RAG establishes a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA by progressively refining understanding through iterative knowledge retrieval and reasoning.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on
knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the
image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for
providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass
framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this
limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that
leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly
retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an
accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These
queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases
containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired
knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining
understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks,
including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG
significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing
a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater 3D reconstruction faces challenges like light distortion, turbidity, and limited visibility. Existing AI methods don't fully exploit language model integration with visual processing for semantic understanding.

Method: Embed semantic features into Gaussian primitives supervised by CLIP-extracted features, use semantic consistency loss, and implement stage-wise training with coarse-to-fine learning and late-stage parameter refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets with up to 3.09 dB average PSNR improvement across three metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides robust and high-fidelity deep-sea scene reconstruction, making it suitable for underwater exploration and marine perception applications.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction in underwater environments remains a complex
challenge due to issues such as light distortion, turbidity, and limited
visibility. AI-based techniques have been applied to address these issues,
however, existing methods have yet to fully exploit the potential of AI,
particularly in integrating language models with visual processing. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages multimodal cross-knowledge
to create semantic-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for robust and high-fidelity
deep-sea scene reconstruction. By embedding an extra semantic feature into each
Gaussian primitive and supervised by the CLIP extracted semantic feature, our
method enforces semantic and structural awareness throughout the training. The
dedicated semantic consistency loss ensures alignment with high-level scene
understanding. Besides, we propose a novel stage-wise training strategy,
combining coarse-to-fine learning with late-stage parameter refinement, to
further enhance both stability and reconstruction quality. Extensive results
show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
SeaThru-NeRF and Submerged3D datasets across three metrics, with an improvement
of up to 3.09 dB on average in terms of PSNR, making it a strong candidate for
applications in underwater exploration and marine perception.

*Yang Chen,Sanglin Zhao,Baoyu Chen,Mans Gustaf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM) for fetal ultrasound classification that mimics clinical contrast adjustment practices, improving accuracy across various model types by 1.15-2.02% on multi-center dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal ultrasound classification faces challenges like low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations that limit diagnostic reliability.

Method: Uses shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, transforms images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers.

Result: Consistent performance improvement across diverse models: lightweight models +2.02%, traditional models +1.29%, state-of-the-art models +1.15% on 12,400 multi-center images across six anatomical categories.

Conclusion: The module effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics through physics-informed transformations aligned with sonographer workflows, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world quality variations.

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable
prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue
contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast
adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical
practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more
discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow
texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters,
transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through
differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated
on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories,
the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with
accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of
traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art
models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its
content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with
physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while
improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This
approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level
semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under
real-world image quality variations.

### [212] [Sequential Difference Maximization: Generating Adversarial Examples via Multi-Stage Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00826)
*Xinlei Liu,Tao Hu,Peng Yi,Weitao Han,Jichao Xie,Baolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM), a gradient-based adversarial attack method with a three-layer optimization framework that maximizes the difference between non-true labels' probability upper bound and true label's probability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop more efficient adversarial attack methods for assessing computer vision model robustness by reconstructing the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples.

Method: SDM uses a three-layer 'cycle-stage-step' optimization framework with different loss functions: negative true label probability for initial space compression, and Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss to increase non-true labels' probability upper bound while compressing irrelevant labels.

Result: SDM demonstrates stronger attack performance and higher cost-effectiveness compared to previous SOTA methods, and can be combined with adversarial training to enhance defensive effects.

Conclusion: SDM provides an effective gradient-based attack method that improves both attack performance and efficiency while being compatible with adversarial training defenses.

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the
robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the
optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the
difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true
label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed
Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer
optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and
between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages
differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative
probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the
solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability
Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true
labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels'
probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA
methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves
higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with
adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is

TL;DR: Novel texture defect detection method combining U-Net local features with Vision Transformer global processing, using Gabor filters and blurring techniques to achieve high accuracy (AUC 0.939) across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and reliability of texture-based surface defect detection by addressing challenges with background noise, varying textures, and noisy environments that traditional methods struggle with.

Method: Combines U-Net for local feature training and Vision Transformer (ViT) for global processing. Uses Gaussian filter-based loss function to remove background noise, Salt-and-Pepper masking to reinforce texture-defect boundaries, and Gabor filters in post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.

Result: Achieved average AUC of 0.939 across MVTec-AD, Surface Crack Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly datasets. Ablation studies confirmed optimal filter size and noise probability significantly enhance performance.

Conclusion: The proposed Gabor filter and blurring U-Net-ViT model effectively detects surface defects across various textures with high accuracy and robustness in noisy environments, demonstrating superior performance through optimized parameter settings.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability
of texture-based surface defect detection using Gabor filters and a blurring
U-Net-ViT model. By combining the local feature training of U-Net with the
global processing of the Vision Transformer(ViT), the model effectively detects
defects across various textures. A Gaussian filter-based loss function removes
background noise and highlights defect patterns, while Salt-and-Pepper(SP)
masking in the training process reinforces texture-defect boundaries, ensuring
robust performance in noisy environments. Gabor filters are applied in
post-processing to emphasize defect orientation and frequency characteristics.
Parameter optimization, including filter size, sigma, wavelength, gamma, and
orientation, maximizes performance across datasets like MVTec-AD, Surface Crack
Detection, and Marble Surface Anomaly Dataset, achieving an average Area Under
the Curve(AUC) of 0.939. The ablation studies validate that the optimal filter
size and noise probability significantly enhance defect detection performance.

### [214] [UPGS: Unified Pose-aware Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00831)
*Zhijing Wu,Longguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified optimization framework that jointly optimizes camera poses and 3D Gaussian attributes to handle motion blur in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail due to motion blur undermining pose estimation, leading to accumulated errors and inferior reconstruction results in dynamic 3D scene reconstruction.

Method: Incorporates camera poses as learnable parameters with 3DGS attributes for end-to-end optimization, models motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations, and uses a three-stage training schedule (pose-fixed Gaussian training, Gaussian-fixed pose optimization, then joint optimization).

Result: Achieves significant gains in reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy on Stereo Blur dataset and real-world sequences compared to prior dynamic deblurring methods.

Conclusion: The unified optimization framework with joint pose and Gaussian optimization effectively handles motion blur and improves dynamic 3D scene reconstruction from monocular video.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video has broad applications
in AR/VR, robotics, and autonomous navigation, but often fails due to severe
motion blur caused by camera and object motion. Existing methods commonly
follow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D
Gaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose
estimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction
results. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework
by incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS
attributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and
object motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and
formulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we
introduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and
Gaussians alternatively. Particularly, 3D Gaussians are first trained with
poses being fixed, and then poses are optimized with 3D Gaussians being
untouched. Finally, all learnable parameters are optimized together. Extensive
experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and challenging real-world sequences
demonstrate that our method achieves significant gains in reconstruction
quality and pose estimation accuracy over prior dynamic deblurring methods.

TL;DR: SegDINO is an efficient segmentation framework that combines a frozen DINOv3 backbone with a lightweight MLP decoder, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for adapting DINO self-supervised vision models for segmentation rely on heavy decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce substantial parameter overhead and computational cost.

Method: Extracts multi-level features from a frozen DINOv3 pretrained encoder, aligns them to common resolution and channel width, and uses a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across six benchmarks including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha) with minimal trainable parameters.

Conclusion: SegDINO demonstrates that lightweight decoders can effectively leverage foundation model representations for segmentation tasks without the need for complex, parameter-heavy architectures, preserving representational power while minimizing computational cost.

Abstract: The DINO family of self-supervised vision models has shown remarkable
transferability, yet effectively adapting their representations for
segmentation remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on heavy
decoders with multi-scale fusion or complex upsampling, which introduce
substantial parameter overhead and computational cost. In this work, we propose
SegDINO, an efficient segmentation framework that couples a frozen DINOv3
backbone with a lightweight decoder. SegDINO extracts multi-level features from
the pretrained encoder, aligns them to a common resolution and channel width,
and utilizes a lightweight MLP head to directly predict segmentation masks.
This design minimizes trainable parameters while preserving the
representational power of foundation features. Extensive experiments across six
benchmarks, including three medical datasets (TN3K, Kvasir-SEG, ISIC) and three
natural image datasets (MSD, VMD-D, ViSha), demonstrate that SegDINO
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/script-Yang/SegDINO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Atmospheric interference and haze degrade satellite image clarity and reduce information extraction accuracy, requiring effective dehazing solutions.

Method: Hybrid framework integrating Swin Transformer and U-Net with SwinRRDB blocks for global context and local detail learning, plus composite loss function (L2 loss, guided loss, watershed loss) for structural preservation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models on RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. On RICE: PSNR 33.24 dB, SSIM 0.967 - significant improvement over existing methods.

Conclusion: Provides effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in satellite imagery with potential applicability across diverse remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in various fields; however,
atmospheric interference and haze significantly degrade image clarity and
reduce the accuracy of information extraction. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a hybrid dehazing framework that integrates Swin
Transformer and U-Net to balance global context learning and local detail
restoration, called SUFERNOBWA. The proposed network employs SwinRRDB, a Swin
Transformer-based Residual-in-Residual Dense Block, in both the encoder and
decoder to effectively extract features. This module enables the joint learning
of global contextual information and fine spatial structures, which is crucial
for structural preservation in satellite image. Furthermore, we introduce a
composite loss function that combines L2 loss, guided loss, and a novel
watershed loss, which enhances structural boundary preservation and ensures
pixel-level accuracy. This architecture enables robust dehazing under diverse
atmospheric conditions while maintaining structural consistency across restored
images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art models on both the RICE and SateHaze1K datasets. Specifically,
on the RICE dataset, the proposed approach achieved a PSNR of 33.24 dB and an
SSIM of 0.967, which is a significant improvement over existing method. This
study provides an effective solution for mitigating atmospheric interference in
satellite imagery and highlights its potential applicability across diverse
remote sensing applications.

*Xueyang Kang,Zhengkang Xiang,Zezheng Zhang,Kourosh Khoshelham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel two-stage method for single-view novel view synthesis that first generates 360-degree panoramas then interpolates views using keyframes, ensuring long-term consistency and loop closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-view NVS methods fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories, leading to inconsistent results when generating views significantly different from the input.

Method: Decomposes NVS into 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. Uses a panorama diffusion model to learn scene prior, then samples and warps perspective keyframes from panorama to guide a video diffusion model with spatial noise diffusion process.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories, produces globally consistent novel views even in loop closure scenarios, and enables flexible camera control.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage approach effectively addresses long-term view and scene consistency challenges in single-view NVS, demonstrating superior performance across diverse scene datasets.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to
large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from
the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and
generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view
alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that
addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene
extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures
long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and
warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a
panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective
image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and
used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates
novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to
prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop
closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on
diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our
implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FQAT is a flatness-oriented quantization-aware training method that addresses OOD generalization degradation in quantized models through layer-wise freezing and adaptive algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current QAT methods focus only on in-distribution performance but cause significant out-of-distribution performance degradation, creating a need for generalizable quantization.

Method: Proposes FQAT with layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate gradient conflicts and disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm with gradient disorder metric to identify unstable layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show FQAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both I.D and OOD image classification tasks.

Conclusion: FQAT successfully addresses the OOD generalization problem in QAT by incorporating flatness-oriented optimization through innovative freezing mechanisms.

Abstract: Current quantization-aware training (QAT) methods primarily focus on
enhancing the performance of quantized models on in-distribution (I.D) data,
while overlooking the potential performance degradation on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data. In this paper, we first substantiate this problem through rigorous
experiment, showing that QAT can lead to a significant OOD generalization
performance degradation. Further, we find the contradiction between the
perspective that flatness of loss landscape gives rise to superior OOD
generalization and the phenomenon that QAT lead to a sharp loss landscape, can
cause the above problem. Therefore, we propose a flatness-oriented QAT method,
FQAT, to achieve generalizable QAT. Specifically, i) FQAT introduces a
layer-wise freezing mechanism to mitigate the gradient conflict issue between
dual optimization objectives (i.e., vanilla QAT and flatness). ii) FQAT
proposes an disorder-guided adaptive freezing algorithm to dynamically
determines which layers to freeze at each training step, effectively addressing
the challenges caused by interference between layers. A gradient disorder
metric is designed to help the algorithm identify unstable layers during
training. Extensive experiments on influential OOD benchmark demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under both I.D and
OOD image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel pose-based scoliosis screening framework that addresses dataset scarcity and pose data limitations through dual representation learning with clinical prior guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI scoliosis screening relies on silhouette data, missing clinically important postural asymmetries. Pose data offers better clinical interpretability but faces challenges with dataset scarcity and noise sensitivity in raw coordinates.

Method: Introduces Scoliosis1K-Pose dataset with 447,900 pose frames, and Dual Representation Framework (DRF) combining continuous skeleton maps with discrete Postural Asymmetry Vectors (PAV), enhanced by PAV-Guided Attention module for clinical prior integration.

Result: DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance, with visualizations confirming effective use of clinical asymmetry cues and synergy between dual representations.

Conclusion: The framework successfully bridges the gap between AI methods and clinical practice by incorporating clinically relevant postural asymmetries through pose data and guided attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale
silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural
asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data
provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical
interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based
scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the
scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and
noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of
subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce
Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original
Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050
adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation
Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial
structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes
clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA)
module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from
the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues
to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual
representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at

TL;DR: Spotlighter is a lightweight token-selection framework that improves prompt tuning efficiency and accuracy by selecting only the most relevant visual tokens using sample-wise and semantic-wise evaluation with a semantic memory bank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's prompt tuning achieves cross-modal alignment but suffers from redundant features that introduce noise and computational inefficiency. There's a need to enhance both accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning.

Method: Proposes Spotlighter framework that evaluates visual tokens from sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives, retains top-scoring tokens, uses class-specific semantic memory bank with learned prototypes, and employs two-level ranking mechanism for dynamic token-prototype weighting.

Result: Outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19% in harmonic mean accuracy across 11 few-shot benchmarks, achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters.

Conclusion: Spotlighter establishes an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal parameter overhead.

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust
cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition
to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature
components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this
work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that
simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter
evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and
semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for
downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned
prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and
compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals,
we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights
token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter
outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to
0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish
Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for

Result: Achieved first place in AIM 2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on rigorous benchmark dataset.

Conclusion: Sets new standard for low-light video denoising through synergistic combination of metadata conditioning and temporal dependency modeling.

Abstract: Low-light RAW video denoising is a fundamentally challenging task due to
severe signal degradation caused by high sensor gain and short exposure times,
which are inherently limited by video frame rate requirements. To address this,
we propose DarkVRAI, a novel framework that achieved first place in the AIM
2025 Low-light RAW Video Denoising Challenge. Our method introduces two primary
contributions: (1) a successful application of a conditioning scheme for image
denoising, which explicitly leverages capture metadata, to video denoising to
guide the alignment and denoising processes, and (2) a Burst-Order Selective
Scan (BOSS) mechanism that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies
within the noisy video sequence. By synergistically combining these components,
DarkVRAI demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a rigorous and realistic
benchmark dataset, setting a new standard for low-light video denoising.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangDC is a language-aware dynamic token compressor that uses a lightweight language model to generate soft caption tokens from video clips, dynamically adjusting compression ratios based on semantic density to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video token compression methods use fixed compression ratios, which inefficiently handle varying semantic density across video clips - either under-representing information-rich clips or wasting computation on static/poor-content clips.

Method: Uses a lightweight language model to describe video clips and generate soft caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with semantic density-aware supervision to cover key visual cues and dynamically adjust compression ratios based on scene richness (description length).

Result: Reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive performance. Qualitatively shows adaptive token compression ratio adjustment based on video segment richness.

Conclusion: LangDC successfully addresses the limitations of fixed compression ratios by dynamically adapting to video content complexity, significantly improving computational efficiency without sacrificing video understanding performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large video-language models have revolutionized video
understanding tasks. However, their efficiency is significantly constrained by
processing high volumes of visual tokens. Existing token compression strategies
apply a fixed compression ratio, ignoring the variability in semantic density
among different video clips. Consequently, this lead to inadequate
representation of information-rich clips due to insufficient tokens and
unnecessary computation on static or content-poor ones. To address this, we
propose LangDC, a Language-aware Dynamic Token Compressor. LangDC leverages a
lightweight language model to describe video clips, converting them into soft
caption tokens as visual representations. Trained with our proposed semantic
density-aware supervision, LangDC aims to 1) cover key visual cues necessary
for downstream task reasoning and 2) dynamically adjust compression ratios
based on scene richness, reflected by descriptions length. Our design mimics
how humans dynamically express what they see: complex scenes (seeing more)
elicit more detailed language to convey nuances (saying more), whereas simpler
scenes are described with fewer words. Experimental results show that our
method reduces FLOPs by 49% compared to VideoGPT+ while maintaining competitive
performance. Furthermore, qualitative results demonstrate our approach
adaptively adjusts the token compression ratio based on video segment richness.

*Josef Grün,Lukas Meyer,Maximilian Weiherer,Bernhard Egger,Marc Stamminger,Linus Franke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrating RGB and multi-spectral imagery into 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, with joint optimization strategy showing best results for spectral reconstruction and RGB enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS works well on RGB data but naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor reconstructions due to inconsistent geometry appearance across spectral domains, despite the actual geometry being the same.

Method: Evaluated three strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction, 2) Splitting optimization (first optimize RGB geometry then fit new bands), 3) Joint optimization (modalities optimized together, optionally with initial RGB-only phase). Integrated multi-spectral data into spherical harmonics color components.

Result: Joint optimization strategy was most effective, increasing overall spectral reconstruction and enhancing RGB results through spectral cross-talk. Provided insights on when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization.

Conclusion: Multi-spectral data should be integrated directly into spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's multi-spectral reflectance, with joint optimization being the recommended approach for robust multi-modal 3DGS reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a study of how to integrate color (RGB) and multi-spectral imagery
(red, green, red-edge, and near-infrared) into the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
framework, a state-of-the-art explicit radiance-field-based method for fast and
high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. While 3DGS excels on
RGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor
reconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral
domain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,
regardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three
strategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)
Splitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and
then fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band
representation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,
optionally with an initial RGB-only phase. We showcase through quantitative
metrics and qualitative novel-view renderings on multi-spectral datasets the
effectiveness of our dedicated optimized Joint strategy, increasing overall
spectral reconstruction as well as enhancing RGB results through spectral
cross-talk. We therefore suggest integrating multi-spectral data directly into
the spherical harmonics color components to compactly model each Gaussian's
multi-spectral reflectance. Moreover, our analysis reveals several key
trade-offs in when and how to introduce spectral bands during optimization,

*Ghazal Farhani,Taufiq Rahman,Dominique Charlebois*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rainy conditions cause drivers to exhibit different gaze patterns including more dashboard glances, longer fixations, and higher gaze elevation compared to clear weather driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rainy weather increases road accident risks due to reduced visibility and traction. Understanding how experienced drivers adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior is critical for designing better driver monitoring and assistance systems.

Method: Case study analyzing eye gaze behavior on same highway route in clear vs rainy conditions. Used two-step clustering approach: clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals, then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. Also employed Markov transition matrices, fixation duration, gaze elevation, and azimuth distribution metrics.

Result: While overall gaze behavior remained consistent (road focus with mirror checks), rainy conditions led to: more frequent dashboard glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation - indicating increased cognitive focus.

Conclusion: Findings provide valuable insights into visual attention patterns under adverse conditions and demonstrate the potential of gaze modeling for designing more robust ADAS and driver monitoring systems.

Abstract: Rainy weather significantly increases the risk of road accidents due to
reduced visibility and vehicle traction. Understanding how experienced drivers
adapt their visual perception through gaze behavior under such conditions is
critical for designing robust driver monitoring systems (DMS) and for informing
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). This case study investigates the eye
gaze behavior of a driver operating the same highway route under both clear and
rainy conditions. To this end, gaze behavior was analyzed by a two-step
clustering approach: first, clustering gaze points within 10-second intervals,
and then aggregating cluster centroids into meta-clusters. This, along with
Markov transition matrices and metrics such as fixation duration, gaze
elevation, and azimuth distributions, reveals meaningful behavioral shifts.
While the overall gaze behavior focused on the road with occasional mirror
checks remains consistent, rainy conditions lead to more frequent dashboard
glances, longer fixation durations, and higher gaze elevation, indicating
increased cognitive focus. These findings offer valuable insight into visual
attention patterns under adverse conditions and highlight the potential of
leveraging gaze modeling to aid in the design of more robust ADAS and DMS.

Conclusion: The automated system significantly increases restoration efficiency and range, with publicly contributed annotated substrate image dataset to advance future coral reef research.

Abstract: Coral reefs are on the brink of collapse, with climate change, ocean
acidification, and pollution leading to a projected 70-90% loss of coral

success hinges on introducing automation to upscale efforts. We present
automated deployment of coral re-seeding devices powered by artificial
intelligence, computer vision, and robotics. Specifically, we perform automated
substrate classification, enabling detection of areas of the seafloor suitable
for coral growth, thus significantly reducing reliance on human experts and
increasing the range and efficiency of restoration. Real-world testing of the
algorithms on the Great Barrier Reef leads to deployment accuracy of 77.8%,

### [226] [CompSlider: Compositional Slider for Disentangled Multiple-Attribute Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01028)
*Zixin Zhu,Kevin Duarte,Mamshad Nayeem Rizve,Chengyuan Xu,Ratheesh Kalarot,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompSlider enables simultaneous control of multiple image attributes in text-to-image generation using disentangled sliders, avoiding attribute interference while maintaining structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slider-based methods train individual adapters per attribute, causing interference between attributes and preventing precise multi-attribute control.

Method: CompSlider generates a conditional prior for T2I models with novel disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes while maintaining image consistency. Operates in latent space without retraining foundation models.

Result: Achieves reliable and independent manipulation of multiple attributes simultaneously while reducing computational burden for both training and inference.

Conclusion: The approach successfully disentangles multiple attributes for precise control, demonstrates generality across various attributes, and extends to video generation applications.

Abstract: In text-to-image (T2I) generation, achieving fine-grained control over
attributes - such as age or smile - remains challenging, even with detailed
text prompts. Slider-based methods offer a solution for precise control of
image attributes. Existing approaches typically train individual adapter for
each attribute separately, overlooking the entanglement among multiple
attributes. As a result, interference occurs among different attributes,
preventing precise control of multiple attributes together. To address this
challenge, we aim to disentangle multiple attributes in slider-based generation
to enbale more reliable and independent attribute manipulation. Our approach,
CompSlider, can generate a conditional prior for the T2I foundation model to
control multiple attributes simultaneously. Furthermore, we introduce novel
disentanglement and structure losses to compose multiple attribute changes
while maintaining structural consistency within the image. Since CompSlider
operates in the latent space of the conditional prior and does not require
retraining the foundation model, it reduces the computational burden for both
training and inference. We evaluate our approach on a variety of image
attributes and highlight its generality by extending to video generation.

*Qiang Li,Yuanming Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an all-in-one model for restoring images taken through contaminated glass using real paired data and one-shot test-time adaptation to handle various contaminants like mud, dirt, and particles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on synthetic data or only handle rain drops, but real-world glass contaminants include various types like muddy water and dirt that require more robust solutions.

Method: Uses real paired images for training and proposes a self-supervised auxiliary learning task with one-shot test-time adaptation to update the model for each test image's unique occlusion type.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively, especially on unseen contaminated images.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively handles diverse real-world glass contaminants through test-time adaptation and real paired training data, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered
to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the
incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing
deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses
relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean
image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of
rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task
of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a
wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign
particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a
great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants.
More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of
different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It
involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model
for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images,
especially the unseen ones.

### [228] [A Unified Low-level Foundation Model for Enhancing Pathology Image Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01071)
*Ziyi Liu,Zhe Xu,Jiabo Ma,Wenqaing Li,Junlin Hou,Fuxiang Huang,Xi Wang,Ronald Cheong Kin Chan,Terence Tsz Wai Wong,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LPFM, the first unified low-level pathology foundation model that handles image restoration (super-resolution, deblurring, denoising) and virtual staining through a single architecture using contrastive pre-training and conditional diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world pathology images suffer from degradations (noise, blur, low resolution) and staining variability, while existing methods are task-specific and lack versatility. Physical staining introduces costs, delays, and inconsistency.

Method: Uses contrastive pre-trained encoder from 190M unlabeled pathology images to learn stain-invariant features. Unified conditional diffusion process adapts to tasks via textual prompts. Trained on 87,810 WSIs across 34 tissue types and 5 staining protocols.

Result: Statistically significant improvements (p<0.01) over SOTA in most tasks (56/66). Achieves 10-15% PSNR gains for restoration and 12-18% SSIM improvements for virtual staining.

Conclusion: LPFM successfully bridges the gap in low-level pathology image enhancement, providing a versatile foundation model that outperforms specialized methods across multiple tasks through unified architecture and adaptive diffusion.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computational pathology by achieving
remarkable success in high-level diagnostic tasks, yet the critical challenge
of low-level image enhancement remains largely unaddressed. Real-world
pathology images frequently suffer from degradations such as noise, blur, and
low resolution due to slide preparation artifacts, staining variability, and
imaging constraints, while the reliance on physical staining introduces
significant costs, delays, and inconsistency. Although existing methods target
individual problems like denoising or super-resolution, their task-specific
designs lack the versatility to handle the diverse low-level vision challenges
encountered in practice. To bridge this gap, we propose the first unified
Low-level Pathology Foundation Model (LPFM), capable of enhancing image quality
in restoration tasks, including super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising, as
well as facilitating image translation tasks like virtual staining (H&E and
special stains), all through a single adaptable architecture. Our approach
introduces a contrastive pre-trained encoder that learns transferable,
stain-invariant feature representations from 190 million unlabeled pathology
images, enabling robust identification of degradation patterns. A unified
conditional diffusion process dynamically adapts to specific tasks via textual
prompts, ensuring precise control over output quality. Trained on a curated
dataset of 87,810 whole slied images (WSIs) across 34 tissue types and 5
staining protocols, LPFM demonstrates statistically significant improvements
(p<0.01) over state-of-the-art methods in most tasks (56/66), achieving Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) gains of 10-15% for image restoration and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) improvements of 12-18% for virtual
staining.

*Yao Wang,Dong Yang,Zhi Qiao,Wenjian Huang,Liuzhi Yang,Zhen Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectMamba is a novel Mamba-based architecture for medical image detection that uses Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention and Visual State-Space Module with Hilbert Curve Scanning to achieve state-of-the-art performance with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and Transformer models for medical image detection face limitations - CNNs have restricted receptive fields while Transformers have prohibitive computational costs for high-resolution medical images. Mamba's linear complexity for long sequences offers a promising alternative.

Method: Proposes SpectMamba with Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block to separately learn high/low-frequency features, Visual State-Space Module (VSSM), and Hilbert Curve Scanning technique to enhance spatial correlations and local dependencies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across various medical image detection tasks while being both effective and efficient.

Conclusion: SpectMamba successfully addresses the limitations of CNNs and Transformers in medical imaging by leveraging Mamba's linear complexity and novel frequency-spatial attention mechanisms, providing an efficient and accurate solution for abnormality detection.

Abstract: Abnormality detection in medical imaging is a critical task requiring both
high efficiency and accuracy to support effective diagnosis. While
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models are widely
used, both face intrinsic challenges: CNNs have limited receptive fields,
restricting their ability to capture broad contextual information, and
Transformers encounter prohibitive computational costs when processing
high-resolution medical images. Mamba, a recent innovation in natural language
processing, has gained attention for its ability to process long sequences with
linear complexity, offering a promising alternative. Building on this
foundation, we present SpectMamba, the first Mamba-based architecture designed
for medical image detection. A key component of SpectMamba is the Hybrid
Spatial-Frequency Attention (HSFA) block, which separately learns high- and
low-frequency features. This approach effectively mitigates the loss of
high-frequency information caused by frequency bias and correlates
frequency-domain features with spatial features, thereby enhancing the model's
ability to capture global context. To further improve long-range dependencies,
we propose the Visual State-Space Module (VSSM) and introduce a novel Hilbert
Curve Scanning technique to strengthen spatial correlations and local
dependencies, further optimizing the Mamba framework. Comprehensive experiments
show that SpectMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance while being both
effective and efficient across various medical image detection tasks.

### [230] [Bidirectional Sparse Attention for Faster Video Diffusion Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01085)
*Chenlu Zhan,Wen Li,Chuyu Shen,Jun Zhang,Suhui Wu,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BSA framework uses bidirectional sparse attention to dramatically accelerate video DiT training by dynamically sparsifying both queries and key-value pairs, achieving up to 20x FLOPs reduction while maintaining generative quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion Transformer models face prohibitive computational costs due to quadratic complexity of full attention, especially for high-resolution, long-duration videos, requiring more efficient attention mechanisms.

Method: Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework with two components: query sparsity optimization via semantic similarity and dynamic spatial-time training, and KV sparsity through statistical dynamic thresholding to retain only salient KV blocks.

Result: BSA reduces FLOPs by up to 20x, achieves 17.79x faster attention training, and preserves or even surpasses the generative quality of full attention across long sequences.

Conclusion: BSA effectively overcomes computational bottlenecks in video DiT models by dynamically sparsifying attention computation, making high-resolution, long-duration video generation more efficient without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Video diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel in generative quality but hit
major computational bottlenecks when producing high-resolution, long-duration
videos. The quadratic complexity of full attention leads to prohibitively high
training and inference costs. Full attention inefficiency stems from two key
challenges: excessive computation due to the inherent sparsity of Queries and
Key-Value pairs, and redundant computation as fixed sparse patterns fail to
leverage DiT's dynamic attention. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Bidirectional Sparse Attention (BSA) framework for faster video DiT training,
the first to dynamically sparsify both Queries and Key-Value pairs within 3D
full attention, thereby substantially improving training and inference
efficiency. BSA addresses these issues through two key components. Query
sparsity is optimized by selecting the most informative query tokens via
semantic similarity and with a dynamic spatial-time training strategy, while KV
sparsity is achieved by computing a statistical dynamic threshold to retain
only the most salient KV blocks for computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BSA significantly accelerates DiT training across long
sequences, reducing FLOPs by up to 20x and achieving 17.79x faster attention
training, while preserving or even surpassing the generative quality of full
attention.

### [231] [An End-to-End Framework for Video Multi-Person Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01095)
*Zhihong Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEPE is an end-to-end video pose estimation framework that uses spatio-temporal Transformers to address limitations of traditional two-stage approaches, improving both accuracy and inference efficiency by 300%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-stage video pose estimation methods separate spatial and temporal processing, rely on complex post-processing, and cannot capture global spatio-temporal context for end-to-end optimization, leading to reduced efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes VEPE framework with three spatio-temporal Transformer components: Spatio-Temporal Pose Encoder (STPE), Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). Includes instance consistency mechanism to enhance cross-frame query matching and enable instance tracking.

Result: Extensive experiments on Posetrack dataset show the approach outperforms most two-stage models and improves inference efficiency by 300%.

Conclusion: VEPE provides a simple and flexible end-to-end solution for video pose estimation that effectively utilizes temporal context while significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Video-based human pose estimation models aim to address scenarios that cannot
be effectively solved by static image models such as motion blur, out-of-focus
and occlusion. Most existing approaches consist of two stages: detecting human
instances in each image frame and then using a temporal model for single-person
pose estimation. This approach separates the spatial and temporal dimensions
and cannot capture the global spatio-temporal context between spatial instances
for end-to-end optimization. In addition, it relies on separate detectors and
complex post-processing such as RoI cropping and NMS, which reduces the
inference efficiency of the video scene. To address the above problems, we
propose VEPE (Video End-to-End Pose Estimation), a simple and flexible
framework for end-to-end pose estimation in video. The framework utilizes three
crucial spatio-temporal Transformer components: the Spatio-Temporal Pose
Encoder (STPE), the Spatio-Temporal Deformable Memory Encoder (STDME), and the
Spatio-Temporal Pose Decoder (STPD). These components are designed to
effectively utilize temporal context for optimizing human body pose estimation.
Furthermore, to reduce the mismatch problem during the cross-frame pose query
matching process, we propose an instance consistency mechanism, which aims to
enhance the consistency and discrepancy of the cross-frame instance query and
realize the instance tracking function, which in turn accurately guides the
pose query to perform cross-frame matching. Extensive experiments on the
Posetrack dataset show that our approach outperforms most two-stage models and
improves inference efficiency by 300%.

*Xuan Deng,Xingtao Wang,Xiandong Meng,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PVINet is a point-voxel interlaced network that processes global structural and local contextual features in parallel with cross-scale interactions for improved point cloud compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point cloud compression methods process global and local information sequentially without communication between them, limiting reconstruction quality.

Method: Uses voxel-based encoder for global features and point-based encoder for local contexts, with novel conditional sparse convolution that dynamically customizes kernels using point embeddings to enable feature interactions.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PVINet effectively enhances feature perception efficiency through parallel processing and interaction of global and local information in point cloud compression.

Abstract: In point cloud compression, the quality of a reconstructed point cloud relies
on both the global structure and the local context, with existing methods
usually processing global and local information sequentially and lacking
communication between these two types of information. In this paper, we propose
a point-voxel interlaced network (PVINet), which captures global structural
features and local contextual features in parallel and performs interactions at
each scale to enhance feature perception efficiency. Specifically, PVINet
contains a voxel-based encoder (Ev) for extracting global structural features
and a point-based encoder (Ep) that models local contexts centered at each
voxel. Particularly, a novel conditional sparse convolution is introduced,
which applies point embeddings to dynamically customize kernels for voxel
feature extraction, facilitating feature interactions from Ep to Ev. During
decoding, a voxel-based decoder employs conditional sparse convolutions to
incorporate point embeddings as guidance to reconstruct the point cloud.
Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PVINet delivers competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [233] [FICGen: Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement for Layout-driven Degraded Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01107)
*Wenzhuang Wang,Yifan Zhao,Mingcan Ma,Ming Liu,Zhonglin Jiang,Yong Chen,Jia Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FICGen is a new frequency-inspired generative paradigm that addresses layout-to-image generation challenges in degraded scenes by transferring frequency knowledge to latent diffusion space, using dual-query mechanisms and frequency-aware guidance to improve fidelity and alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layout-to-image generation suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with user layouts in degraded conditions (low-light, underwater) due to the "contextual illusion dilemma" where foreground instances are overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions.

Method: Proposes FICGen with two main steps: 1) learnable dual-query mechanism with frequency resamplers to extract contextual frequency prototypes from degraded exemplars, 2) visual-frequency enhanced attention to inject frequency prototypes into generation process. Includes instance coherence map for latent-space disentanglement and adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module.

Result: Extensive experiments on 5 benchmarks across various degraded scenarios (severe low-light to mild blur) demonstrate FICGen consistently surpasses existing L2I methods in generative fidelity, alignment, and downstream auxiliary trainability.

Conclusion: FICGen effectively addresses the contextual illusion dilemma in degraded scene generation by leveraging frequency knowledge transfer and contextual disentanglement, achieving superior performance in layout-to-image generation for challenging degraded conditions.

Abstract: Layout-to-image (L2I) generation has exhibited promising results in natural
domains, but suffers from limited generative fidelity and weak alignment with
user-provided layouts when applied to degraded scenes (i.e., low-light,
underwater). We primarily attribute these limitations to the "contextual
illusion dilemma" in degraded conditions, where foreground instances are
overwhelmed by context-dominant frequency distributions. Motivated by this, our
paper proposes a new Frequency-Inspired Contextual Disentanglement Generative
(FICGen) paradigm, which seeks to transfer frequency knowledge of degraded
images into the latent diffusion space, thereby facilitating the rendering of
degraded instances and their surroundings via contextual frequency-aware
guidance. To be specific, FICGen consists of two major steps. Firstly, we
introduce a learnable dual-query mechanism, each paired with a dedicated
frequency resampler, to extract contextual frequency prototypes from
pre-collected degraded exemplars in the training set. Secondly, a
visual-frequency enhanced attention is employed to inject frequency prototypes
into the degraded generation process. To alleviate the contextual illusion and
attribute leakage, an instance coherence map is developed to regulate
latent-space disentanglement between individual instances and their
surroundings, coupled with an adaptive spatial-frequency aggregation module to
reconstruct spatial-frequency mixed degraded representations. Extensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks involving a variety of degraded scenarios-from
severe low-light to mild blur-demonstrate that FICGen consistently surpasses
existing L2I methods in terms of generative fidelity, alignment and downstream
auxiliary trainability.

*Zhengqiang Zhang,Rongyuan Wu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPSToken is a novel Gaussian parameterized spatially-adaptive tokenization framework that uses 2D Gaussians to dynamically model image regions with varying shapes, positions, and textures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image reconstruction and generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional uniform grid tokenization methods are inflexible for representing regions with varying shapes and textures at different locations, limiting feature representation efficacy.

Method: Uses entropy-driven algorithm to partition images into texture-homogeneous regions, parameterizes each region as 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) with texture features, and trains specialized transformer to optimize Gaussian parameters with differentiable splatting-based renderer.

Result: Achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using only 128 tokens, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GPSToken enables non-uniform image tokenization, disentangles spatial layout from texture features for efficient two-stage generation, and provides superior performance compared to conventional uniform tokenization methods.

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image
representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform
2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying
shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of
feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel
$\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive
$\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by
leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position,
and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven
algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable
sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position,
covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer
is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation
of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding,
Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a
differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization
with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial
layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient
two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks,
followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID
scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128
tokens, respectively. Codes and models of GPSToken can be found at

### [235] [MetaSSL: A General Heterogeneous Loss for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01144)
*Weiren Zhao,Lanfeng Zhong,Xin Liao,Wenjun Liao,Sichuan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Guotai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSL is a universal semi-supervised learning framework for medical image segmentation that uses spatially heterogeneous loss weighting based on prediction uncertainty and consistency to handle noisy labels and improve existing SSL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSL methods overlook noise in labeled data and ignore the heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels, focusing only on generating reference predictions rather than effectively mining information from both predictions.

Method: Proposes a spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by leveraging uncertainty and consistency between reference and supervised predictions, categorizing predictions into four regions (UC, US, DC, DS) with adaptive confidence thresholding.

Result: Experimental results showed significant improvement in segmentation performance when integrated with existing SSL frameworks across different datasets.

Conclusion: MetaSSL provides a plug-and-play universal framework that effectively mines information from predictions and handles annotation noise, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) is important for reducing the annotation cost
for medical image segmentation models. State-of-the-art SSL methods such as
Mean Teacher, FixMatch and Cross Pseudo Supervision (CPS) are mainly based on
consistency regularization or pseudo-label supervision between a reference
prediction and a supervised prediction. Despite the effectiveness, they have
overlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on
strategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the
heterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively
mining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss
function, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is
more essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a
spatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by
simultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between
the reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the
predictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the
loss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant
and Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive
threshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious
ones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust
learning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is
plug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental
results showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when
integrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MetaSSL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTrajecter is a novel end-to-end multi-view pedestrian tracking method that uses trajectory motion and appearance costs from multiple past timestamps for robust association, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous end-to-end MVPT methods only use current and single adjacent past timestamp information, discarding valuable past trajectory data that could improve tracking robustness.

Method: Proposes MVTrajecter with trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to incorporate information from multiple past timestamps, using attention mechanism to capture relationships between timestamps.

Result: Extensive experiments show effectiveness of each component and demonstrate superior performance over previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Utilizing multiple past timestamps through trajectory-based costs and attention mechanisms significantly improves multi-view pedestrian tracking performance.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Tracking (MVPT) aims to track pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view occupancy map from multi-view videos. End-to-end methods
that detect and associate pedestrians within one model have shown great
progress in MVPT. The motion and appearance information of pedestrians is
important for the association, but previous end-to-end MVPT methods rely only
on the current and its single adjacent past timestamp, discarding the past
trajectories before that. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end MVPT method
called Multi-View Trajectory Tracker (MVTrajecter) that utilizes information
from multiple timestamps in past trajectories for robust association.
MVTrajecter introduces trajectory motion cost and trajectory appearance cost to
effectively incorporate motion and appearance information, respectively. These
costs calculate which pedestrians at the current and each past timestamp are
likely identical based on the information between those timestamps. Even if a
current pedestrian could be associated with a false pedestrian at some past
timestamp, these costs enable the model to associate that current pedestrian
with the correct past trajectory based on other past timestamps. In addition,
MVTrajecter effectively captures the relationships between multiple timestamps
leveraging the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of each component in MVTrajecter and show that it outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Vision encoders used in multimodal LLMs fail to identify the most informative video frames for answering text queries, suggesting need for better keyframe selection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether current vision-language encoders can truly identify the most informative frames in videos for multimodal language models, as existing methods rely on keyframe sampling but their effectiveness is unclear.

Method: The authors provide empirical evidence through analysis of popular vision encoders (like SigLIP) to evaluate their capability in identifying where MLLMs should focus within videos to appropriately handle textual queries.

Result: Findings reveal that popular vision encoders critically suffer from limited capability to identify the most informative frames, indicating they cannot reliably guide MLLMs to the right video content.

Conclusion: The development of better keyframe identification techniques is necessary for efficient video multimodal large language models, as current vision encoders are inadequate for this task.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to much
progress in video understanding tasks. To avoid the heavy computational cost of
processing all frames, these models typically rely on keyframe sampling methods
guided by vision-language encoders (\textit{e.g.,} SigLIP). However, it remains
unclear whether such encoders can truly identify the most informative frames.
In this work, we provide several empirical pieces of evidence revealing that
popular vision encoders critically suffer from their limited capability to
identify where the MLLM should look inside the video to handle the given
textual query appropriately. Our findings suggest that the development of
better keyframe identification techniques may be necessary for efficient video
MLLMs.

### [238] [DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177)
*Junxiang Liu,Junming Lin,Jiangtong Li,Jie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaMind is a novel framework that reconstructs videos from EEG signals by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features through three core modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance in video reconstruction accuracy and visual fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for reconstructing visual scenes from EEG signals are limited by low spatial resolution, temporal mismatches, and insufficient use of semantic information, leading to inadequate resolution of dynamic coherence and complex semantic context.

Method: DynaMind uses three modules: Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (extracts multimodal semantic features from EEG across brain regions), Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (generates dynamic latent sequence for temporal consistency), and Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (translates blueprint into high-fidelity video using semantic diffusion prior).

Result: On SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind achieved 12.5% and 10.3% improvements in video- and frame-based accuracies respectively, with 9.4% SSIM improvement and 19.7% FVMD reduction, setting new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: DynaMind represents a critical advancement in bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics, demonstrating exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence in EEG-based video reconstruction.

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low
spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and
video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain
activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the
dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual
stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel
framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and
semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper
(RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video
Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to
extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain
regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the
TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal
consistency between the feature representations and the original neural
recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR
translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video
reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by
12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in
pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence
with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical
advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual
semantics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusDPO is a framework that improves multi-subject personalized image generation by adaptively identifying focus regions based on semantic correspondence and image complexity, preventing attribute leakage while maintaining subject fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-subject personalized image generation faces challenges in preserving subject fidelity and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage without requiring test-time optimization.

Method: The framework adaptively identifies focus regions using dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity, progressively adjusting focal areas across noise timesteps with a weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches and penalizes low-confidence regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method substantially enhances existing pre-trained personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-subject and multi-subject benchmarks while effectively mitigating attribute leakage.

Conclusion: FocusDPO advances controllable multi-subject image synthesis by dynamically adjusting focus allocation during DPO process based on semantic complexity, establishing robust correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized
images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time
optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple
subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity
and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a
framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic
correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method
progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a
weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing
regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus
allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of
reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between
generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained
personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both
single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our
method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior
subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of
controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegAssess is a novel DL framework that introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping for comprehensive pixel-level segmentation quality assessment in remote sensing, achieving SOTA performance with excellent zero-shot transferability across 32 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised segmentation quality assessment methods suffer from coarse granularity, incomplete assessments, and poor transferability, creating a need for more robust pixel-level evaluation in remote sensing applications.

Method: Formulates SQA as a four-class panoramic segmentation task (TP, FP, TN, FN) using enhanced SAM architecture with mask prompting via cross-attention. Includes Edge Guided Compaction branch with Aggregated Semantic Filter for edge refinement and Augmented Mixup Sampling for cross-domain robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 32 datasets from 6 sources, demonstrating remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks and establishing PQM as a robust solution for unsupervised SQA.

Conclusion: SegAssess successfully introduces the PQM paradigm for comprehensive pixel-wise segmentation quality assessment, providing a highly transferable and effective solution that addresses limitations of previous unsupervised SQA methods.

Abstract: High-quality image segmentation is fundamental to pixel-level geospatial
analysis in remote sensing, necessitating robust segmentation quality
assessment (SQA), particularly in unsupervised settings lacking ground truth.
Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show
potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete
assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this
paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for
comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning
framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a
fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within
a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive
(FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby
generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything
Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt
for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include
an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF)
module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented
Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to
significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability.
Comprehensive experiments across 32 datasets derived from 6 sources demonstrate
that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits
remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks, establishing PQM via
SegAssess as a robust and transferable solution for unsupervised SQA. The code

TL;DR: PrediTree is the first open-source dataset for high-resolution tree height prediction, combining 0.5m LiDAR canopy height maps with multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery across French forests (3.14M images). A U-Net model trained on this dataset achieved 11.78% error, outperforming ResNet-50 by 12%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by enabling training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth based on multiple past observations at sub-meter resolution.

Method: Proposes an encoder-decoder framework using multi-temporal multi-spectral imagery and relative time differences between image acquisition dates and canopy height map timestamps. Uses U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset.

Conclusion: PrediTree dataset successfully enables accurate tree height prediction, with U-Net architecture showing best performance. The dataset and code are publicly available for further research and forest monitoring applications.

Abstract: We present PrediTree, the first comprehensive open-source dataset designed
for training and evaluating tree height prediction models at sub-meter
resolution. This dataset combines very high-resolution (0.5m) LiDAR-derived
canopy height maps, spatially aligned with multi-temporal and multi-spectral
imagery, across diverse forest ecosystems in France, totaling 3,141,568 images.
PrediTree addresses a critical gap in forest monitoring capabilities by
enabling the training of deep learning methods that can predict tree growth
based on multiple past observations. %\sout{Initially focused on French
forests, PrediTree is designed as an expanding resource with ongoing efforts to
incorporate data from other countries. } To make use of this PrediTree dataset,
we propose an encoder-decoder framework that requires the multi-temporal
multi-spectral imagery and the relative time differences in years between the
canopy height map timestamp (target) and each image acquisition date for which
this framework predicts the canopy height. The conducted experiments
demonstrate that a U-Net architecture trained on the PrediTree dataset provides
the highest masked mean squared error of $11.78\%$, outperforming the next-best
architecture, ResNet-50, by around $12\%$, and cutting the error of the same

*Tianwei Ye,Yong Ma,Xiaoguang Mei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DcMatch is an unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid multi-shape matching that uses shape graph attention networks and dual-level consistency to achieve superior performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods learn canonical embeddings from single shapes, but there's a need to capture the underlying manifold structure of entire shape collections for more robust correspondences.

Method: Leverages shape graph attention network to capture manifold structure, constructs shared latent space with universe predictor, and enforces dual-level consistency through spatial/spectral domain alignment with cycle consistency loss.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching scenarios.

Conclusion: DcMatch provides a novel unsupervised framework that achieves more expressive and robust shape correspondences through collective shape analysis and dual-level consistency enforcement.

Abstract: Establishing point-to-point correspondences across multiple 3D shapes is a
fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we
introduce DcMatch, a novel unsupervised learning framework for non-rigid
multi-shape matching. Unlike existing methods that learn a canonical embedding
from a single shape, our approach leverages a shape graph attention network to
capture the underlying manifold structure of the entire shape collection. This
enables the construction of a more expressive and robust shared latent space,
leading to more consistent shape-to-universe correspondences via a universe
predictor. Simultaneously, we represent these correspondences in both the
spatial and spectral domains and enforce their alignment in the shared universe
space through a novel cycle consistency loss. This dual-level consistency
fosters more accurate and coherent mappings. Extensive experiments on several
challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
previous state-of-the-art approaches across diverse multi-shape matching
scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/YeTianwei/DcMatch.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets, achieving best generalization through zero-shot depth estimation on diverse endoscopic scenes.

Conclusion: The method contributes to accurate endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery, with code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost
and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of
illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for
generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a
self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various
endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different
tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to
efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In
the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small
amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference,
from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the
training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training
framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and
reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both
realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network
also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on
diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate
endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code

*Maëlic Neau,Zoe Falomir,Cédric Buche,Akihiro Sugimoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a new reference-free metric for evaluating open-vocabulary scene graph generation and a synthetic data generation method using region-specific prompt tuning of VLMs to improve model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SGG benchmarks have limited vocabulary, making open-vocabulary evaluation inefficient, and existing methods rely on poor-quality weakly supervised pre-training data.

Method: Introduces a reference-free evaluation metric for open-vocabulary relation prediction and a region-specific prompt tuning approach for VLMs to generate high-quality synthetic training data.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that pre-training with the new synthetic data improves the generalization capabilities of open-vocabulary SGG models.

Conclusion: The proposed evaluation metric and synthetic data generation method address key limitations in open-vocabulary scene graph generation, enabling more effective assessment and improved model performance.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) encodes visual relationships between objects in
images as graph structures. Thanks to the advances of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), the task of Open-Vocabulary SGG has been recently proposed where models
are evaluated on their functionality to learn a wide and diverse range of
relations. Current benchmarks in SGG, however, possess a very limited
vocabulary, making the evaluation of open-source models inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new reference-free metric to fairly evaluate the
open-vocabulary capabilities of VLMs for relation prediction. Another
limitation of Open-Vocabulary SGG is the reliance on weakly supervised data of
poor quality for pre-training. We also propose a new solution for quickly
generating high-quality synthetic data through region-specific prompt tuning of
VLMs. Experimental results show that pre-training with this new data split can
benefit the generalization capabilities of Open-Voc SGG models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRINTER is a weakly-supervised framework for virtual immunohistochemical staining that addresses spatial misalignment issues in tumor analysis by combining prototype-driven content-style decoupling, cyclic registration-synthesis, and deformation-aware adversarial learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for correlating H&E morphology with IHC biomarker expression suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive sections, compromising pathological interpretation accuracy.

Method: The framework uses: 1) Prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style decoupling; 2) GapBridge cyclic registration-synthesis framework for deformable structural alignment between H&E and IHC domains; 3) Deformation-aware adversarial learning with joint optimization of generator and registration network.

Result: Extensive experiments show PRINTER achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: PRINTER provides a robust and scalable solution for virtual staining that advances computational pathology by enabling accurate correlation between H&E morphology and IHC biomarker expression.

Abstract: Tumor spatial heterogeneity analysis requires precise correlation between
Hematoxylin and Eosin H&E morphology and immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker
expression, yet current methods suffer from spatial misalignment in consecutive
sections, severely compromising in situ pathological interpretation. In order
to obtain a more accurate virtual staining pattern, We propose PRINTER, a
weakly-supervised framework that integrates PRototype-drIven content and
staiNing patTERn decoupling and deformation-aware adversarial learning
strategies designed to accurately learn IHC staining patterns while preserving
H&E staining details. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) A
prototype-driven staining pattern transfer with explicit content-style
decoupling; and (2) A cyclic registration-synthesis framework GapBridge that
bridges H&E and IHC domains through deformable structural alignment, where
registered features guide cross-modal style transfer while synthesized outputs
iteratively refine the registration;(3) Deformation-Aware Adversarial Learning:
We propose a training framework where a generator and deformation-aware
registration network jointly adversarially optimize a style-focused
discriminator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRINTER effectively
achieves superior performance in preserving H&E staining details and virtual
staining fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a
robust and scalable solution for virtual staining, advancing the field of

TL;DR: Proposes a fully automated, distillation-free framework with synthetic data generation and self-improvement to create high-quality document extraction datasets and models that handle complex formats like tables and formulas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation is costly and time-consuming, while automatic labeling with existing models lacks accuracy in complex document formats, limiting student model performance in real-world applications.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Generate large-scale diverse synthetic data for initial model training, 2) Self-improvement approach where model annotates real documents, filters verify quality, and retrains iteratively to enhance both model and data quality.

Result: Trained POINTS-1.5 model achieves POINTS-Reader that surpasses many existing public and proprietary models of comparable or larger size in document conversion capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed automated framework successfully creates high-quality document extraction datasets and models without distillation, effectively handling diverse document formats and layouts through synthetic data generation and iterative self-improvement.

Abstract: High-quality labeled data is essential for training accurate document
conversion models, particularly in domains with complex formats such as tables,
formulas, and multi-column text. However, manual annotation is both costly and
time-consuming, while automatic labeling using existing models often lacks
accuracy in handling such challenging scenarios. Consequently, training student
models by distilling outputs from teacher models can significantly limit their
performance in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a fully
automated, distillation-free framework comprising two stages for constructing
high-quality document extraction datasets and models capable of handling
diverse document formats and layouts. In the first stage, we introduce a method
for generating large-scale, diverse synthetic data, which enables a model to
extract key elements in a unified format with strong initial performance. In
the second stage, we present a self-improvement approach that further adapts
the model, initially trained on synthetic data, to real-world documents.
Specifically, we first use the fine-tuned model to annotate real documents,
then apply a suite of filtering strategies to verify annotation quality, and
finally retrain the model on the verified dataset. By iteratively repeating
this process, we progressively enhance both the model's conversion capabilities
and the quality of the generated data. We train a public POINTS-1.5 model to
obtain POINTS-Reader, which surpasses many existing public and proprietary
models of comparable or larger size. Our model is available at

Motivation: Human-Scene Interaction faces challenges in handling long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. Existing methods struggle with trajectory consistency and physical realism in complex environments.

Method: Models interaction as dynamic directed graph with multi-agent system: scene navigator for environmental perception and path planning, planning agent for goal decomposition, and critic agent for closed-loop feedback to correct trajectory drifts. Uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for action generator training to enhance physical realism.

Result: Extensive experiments on custom SceneBench benchmark show FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism, reducing artifacts like limb distortion and foot-sliding.

Conclusion: FantasyHSI successfully addresses HSI challenges through its multi-agent framework with closed-loop feedback mechanism and DPO training, achieving superior performance in generating realistic human behaviors in complex environments.

Abstract: Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) seeks to generate realistic human behaviors
within complex environments, yet it faces significant challenges in handling
long-horizon, high-level tasks and generalizing to unseen scenes. To address
these limitations, we introduce FantasyHSI, a novel HSI framework centered on
video generation and multi-agent systems that operates without paired data. We
model the complex interaction process as a dynamic directed graph, upon which
we build a collaborative multi-agent system. This system comprises a scene
navigator agent for environmental perception and high-level path planning, and
a planning agent that decomposes long-horizon goals into atomic actions.
Critically, we introduce a critic agent that establishes a closed-loop feedback
mechanism by evaluating the deviation between generated actions and the planned
path. This allows for the dynamic correction of trajectory drifts caused by the
stochasticity of the generative model, thereby ensuring long-term logical
consistency. To enhance the physical realism of the generated motions, we
leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the action generator,
significantly reducing artifacts such as limb distortion and foot-sliding.
Extensive experiments on our custom SceneBench benchmark demonstrate that
FantasyHSI significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
generalization, long-horizon task completion, and physical realism. Ours

such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is
to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes novel aleatoric uncertainty modeling for 3D hand pose estimation using a single linear layer to capture joint correlations efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing 3D hand pose estimation methods: inability to estimate aleatoric uncertainty and lack of joint correlation modeling in uncertainty estimation.

Method: Introduces probabilistic distribution formulation for hand joint output space, using a single linear layer parameterization to capture intrinsic joint correlations as an add-on module.

Result: Outperforms existing uncertainty modeling approaches and achieves favorable 3D hand pose estimation accuracy while adding uncertainty modeling capability.

Conclusion: The proposed parameterization provides efficient joint correlation modeling with good computational efficiency, enhancing 3D hand pose estimation with uncertainty awareness.

Abstract: 3D hand pose estimation is a fundamental task in understanding human hands.
However, accurately estimating 3D hand poses remains challenging due to the
complex movement of hands, self-similarity, and frequent occlusions. In this
work, we address two limitations: the inability of existing 3D hand pose
estimation methods to estimate aleatoric (data) uncertainty, and the lack of
uncertainty modeling that incorporates joint correlation knowledge, which has
not been thoroughly investigated. To this end, we introduce aleatoric
uncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to
achieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and
computational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a
single linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints. This
is enabled by formulating the hand joint output space as a probabilistic
distribution, allowing the linear layer to capture joint correlations. Our
proposed parameterization is used as a task head layer, and can be applied as
an add-on module on top of the existing models. Our experiments demonstrate
that our parameterization for uncertainty modeling outperforms existing
approaches. Furthermore, the 3D hand pose estimation model equipped with our
uncertainty head achieves favorable accuracy in 3D hand pose estimation while
introducing new uncertainty modeling capability to the model. The project page

### [250] [Towards More Diverse and Challenging Pre-training for Point Cloud Learning: Self-Supervised Cross Reconstruction with Decoupled Views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01250)
*Xiangdong Zhang,Shaofeng Zhang,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point-PQAE is a two-view cross-reconstruction method for point cloud self-supervised learning that outperforms single-view self-reconstruction approaches by generating decoupled views and reconstructing one from the other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on single-view masked point recovery. Recognizing that two-view pre-training introduces greater diversity and variance, enabling more challenging and informative pre-training.

Method: Proposes Point-PQAE with cross-reconstruction generative paradigm: generates two decoupled point cloud views, then reconstructs one from the other. Develops crop mechanism for view generation and novel positional encoding for 3D relative position representation.

Result: Outperforms self-reconstruction baseline (Point-MAE) by 6.5%, 7.0%, and 6.7% in three variants of ScanObjectNN with Mlp-Linear evaluation protocol.

Conclusion: Cross-reconstruction significantly increases pre-training difficulty compared to self-reconstruction, enabling superior performance in 3D self-supervised learning over single-modal self-reconstruction methods.

Abstract: Point cloud learning, especially in a self-supervised way without manual
labels, has gained growing attention in both vision and learning communities
due to its potential utility in a wide range of applications. Most existing
generative approaches for point cloud self-supervised learning focus on
recovering masked points from visible ones within a single view. Recognizing
that a two-view pre-training paradigm inherently introduces greater diversity
and variance, it may thus enable more challenging and informative pre-training.
Inspired by this, we explore the potential of two-view learning in this domain.
In this paper, we propose Point-PQAE, a cross-reconstruction generative
paradigm that first generates two decoupled point clouds/views and then
reconstructs one from the other. To achieve this goal, we develop a crop
mechanism for point cloud view generation for the first time and further
propose a novel positional encoding to represent the 3D relative position
between the two decoupled views. The cross-reconstruction significantly
increases the difficulty of pre-training compared to self-reconstruction, which

Conclusion: ReCap effectively bridges visual perception with real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image understanding in high-stakes domains.

Abstract: Image captioning systems often produce generic descriptions that fail to
capture event-level semantics which are crucial for applications like news
reporting and digital archiving. We present ReCap, a novel pipeline for
event-enriched image retrieval and captioning that incorporates broader
contextual information from relevant articles to generate narrative-rich,
factually grounded captions. Our approach addresses the limitations of standard
vision-language models that typically focus on visible content while missing
temporal, social, and historical contexts. ReCap comprises three integrated
components: (1) a robust two-stage article retrieval system using DINOv2
embeddings with global feature similarity for initial candidate selection
followed by patch-level mutual nearest neighbor similarity re-ranking; (2) a
context extraction framework that synthesizes information from article
summaries, generic captions, and original source metadata; and (3) a large
language model-based caption generation system with Semantic Gaussian
Normalization to enhance fluency and relevance. Evaluated on the OpenEvents V1
dataset as part of Track 1 in the EVENTA 2025 Grand Challenge, ReCap achieved a
strong overall score of 0.54666, ranking 2nd on the private test set. These
results highlight ReCap's effectiveness in bridging visual perception with
real-world knowledge, offering a practical solution for context-aware image
understanding in high-stakes domains. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Agent framework improves open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by using latent semantic-aware agents to optimize cross-modal attention and enhance semantic perceptibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the domain discrepancy between base category training and open-vocabulary inference in semantic segmentation, and explore the underexplored mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension in vision-language models.

Method: Propose X-Agent framework with latent semantic-aware agents that orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms to optimize latent semantic dynamics and amplify perceptibility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmark evaluations while effectively enhancing latent semantic saliency.

Conclusion: X-Agent successfully addresses the challenges in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by improving latent semantic comprehension through innovative cross-modal attention orchestration.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) conducts pixel-level
classification via text-driven alignment, where the domain discrepancy between
base category training and open-vocabulary inference poses challenges in
discriminative modeling of latent unseen category. To address this challenge,
existing vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches demonstrate commendable
performance through pre-trained multi-modal representations. However, the
fundamental mechanisms of latent semantic comprehension remain underexplored,
making the bottleneck for OVSS. In this work, we initiate a probing experiment
to explore distribution patterns and dynamics of latent semantics in VLMs under
inductive learning paradigms. Building on these insights, we propose X-Agent,
an innovative OVSS framework employing latent semantic-aware ``agent'' to
orchestrate cross-modal attention mechanisms, simultaneously optimizing latent
semantic dynamic and amplifying its perceptibility. Extensive benchmark
evaluations demonstrate that X-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance
while effectively enhancing the latent semantic saliency.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object detection faces significant challenges
from speckle noise, small target ambiguities, and on-board computational
constraints. While existing approaches predominantly focus on SAR-specific
architectural modifications, this paper explores the application of the
existing lightweight object detector, i.e., YOLOv10, for SAR object detection
and enhances its performance through Neural Architecture Search (NAS).
Specifically, we employ NAS to systematically optimize the network structure,
especially focusing on the backbone architecture search. By constructing an
extensive search space and leveraging evolutionary search, our method
identifies a favorable architecture that balances accuracy, parameter
efficiency, and computational cost. Notably, this work introduces NAS to SAR
object detection for the first time. The experimental results on the
large-scale SARDet-100K dataset demonstrate that our optimized model
outperforms existing SAR detection methods, achieving superior detection
accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. We hope this work
offers a novel perspective on leveraging NAS for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient radar object detection model using multi-representation inputs with adapter branch, exchanger module, and neural architecture search for optimal performance-efficiency trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar sensors offer robustness in adverse conditions compared to cameras, but efficient object detection from Range-Doppler radar maps remains challenging.

Method: Multi-representation of RD maps (heatmaps + grayscale), adapter branch, exchanger module, primary-auxiliary fusion, and one-shot neural architecture search for optimal model configuration.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with mAP@50 of 71.9 on RADDet and 57.1 on CARRADA datasets, demonstrating favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-representation approach with neural architecture search effectively improves radar object detection efficiency while maintaining high performance in adverse conditions.

Abstract: Detecting objects efficiently from radar sensors has recently become a
popular trend due to their robustness against adverse lighting and weather
conditions compared with cameras. This paper presents an efficient object
detection model for Range-Doppler (RD) radar maps. Specifically, we first
represent RD radar maps with multi-representation, i.e., heatmaps and grayscale
images, to gather high-level object and fine-grained texture features. Then, we
design an additional Adapter branch, an Exchanger Module with two modes, and a
Primary-Auxiliary Fusion Module to effectively extract, exchange, and fuse
features from the multi-representation inputs, respectively. Furthermore, we
construct a supernet with various width and fusion operations in the Adapter
branch for the proposed model and employ a One-Shot Neural Architecture Search
method to further improve the model's efficiency while maintaining high
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model obtains favorable
accuracy and efficiency trade-off. Moreover, we achieve new state-of-the-art
performance on RADDet and CARRADA datasets with mAP@50 of 71.9 and 57.1,
respectively.

*Huan Ni,Qingshan Liu,Xiaonan Niu,Danfeng Hong,Lingli Zhao,Haiyan Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FSS-TIs, an all-in-one module using ODEs and Fourier transform for cross-domain few-shot segmentation, replacing multiple independent modules with a unified approach that models domain relationships through spectral transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CD-FSS methods use multiple independent modules that hinder knowledge flow and limit collective potential. Need a more integrated approach for better cross-domain generalization in few-shot segmentation.

Method: Uses ordinary differential equations and Fourier transform to model ODE relationships between domain-specific and domain-agnostic feature spectra. Applies iterative transformations with randomized perturbations to spectra, reformulating domain exploration as ODE parameter optimization.

Result: Superior performance over existing CD-FSS methods across five diverse datasets. In-depth ablation studies validate strong cross-domain adaptability.

Conclusion: FSS-TIs provides a structurally concise and effective solution for cross-domain few-shot segmentation by unifying domain adaptation through ODE-based spectral transformations, outperforming previous multi-module approaches.

Abstract: Cross-domain few-shot segmentation (CD-FSS) not only enables the segmentation
of unseen categories with very limited samples, but also improves cross-domain
generalization ability within the few-shot segmentation framework. Currently,
existing CD-FSS studies typically design multiple independent modules to
enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of feature representations.
However, the independence among these modules hinders the effective flow of
knowledge, making it difficult to fully leverage their collective potential. In
contrast, this paper proposes an all-in-one module based on ordinary
differential equations and Fourier transform, resulting in a structurally
concise method--Few-Shot Segmentation over Time Intervals (FSS-TIs). FSS-TIs
assumes the existence of an ODE relationship between the spectra (including
amplitude and phase spectra) of domain-specific features and domain-agnostic
features. This ODE formulation yields an iterative transformation process along
a sequence of time intervals, while simultaneously applying affine
transformations with randomized perturbations to the spectra. In doing so, the
exploration of domain-agnostic feature representation spaces and the simulation
of diverse potential target-domain distributions are reformulated as an
optimization process over the intrinsic parameters of the ODE. Moreover, we
strictly constrain the support-sample selection during target-domain
fine-tuning so that it is consistent with the requirements of real-world
few-shot segmentation tasks. For evaluation, we introduce five datasets from
substantially different domains and define two sets of cross-domain few-shot
segmentation tasks to comprehensively analyze the performance of FSS-TIs.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of FSS-TIs over existing
CD-FSS methods, and in-depth ablation studies further validate the cross-domain
adaptability of FSS-TIs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Joint framework for LiDAR super-resolution and semantic segmentation that achieves comparable performance to expensive 64-channel LiDAR using sparse 16-channel data with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution LiDAR is expensive and limits large-scale autonomous driving deployment, while low-cost sensors produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy.

Method: End-to-end framework with joint optimization, semantic-aware SR module, new loss function focusing on regions of interest, and lightweight model-based architecture.

Result: Achieves segmentation performance comparable to models using expensive 64-channel LiDAR data.

Conclusion: Proposed method enables cost-effective autonomous driving deployment by effectively enhancing sparse LiDAR data while maintaining segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: High-resolution LiDAR data plays a critical role in 3D semantic segmentation
for autonomous driving, but the high cost of advanced sensors limits
large-scale deployment. In contrast, low-cost sensors such as 16-channel LiDAR
produce sparse point clouds that degrade segmentation accuracy. To overcome
this, we introduce the first end-to-end framework that jointly addresses LiDAR
super-resolution (SR) and semantic segmentation. The framework employs joint
optimization during training, allowing the SR module to incorporate semantic
cues and preserve fine details, particularly for smaller object classes. A new
SR loss function further directs the network to focus on regions of interest.
The proposed lightweight, model-based SR architecture uses significantly fewer
parameters than existing LiDAR SR approaches, while remaining easily compatible
with segmentation networks. Experiments show that our method achieves
segmentation performance comparable to models operating on high-resolution and
costly 64-channel LiDAR data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PGRD is a diffusion-based medical image segmentation framework that learns full conditional distributions using prior guidance and residual learning for improved calibration and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation often has inherent ambiguity, requiring models that capture full conditional distributions rather than single point estimates to account for uncertainty.

Method: Embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in continuous space, uses coarse prior predictor for step-wise guidance, learns residual to prior to accelerate convergence, and employs deep diffusion supervision for training stability.

Result: Achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble, Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines on MRI and CT datasets, with fewer sampling steps needed.

Conclusion: PGRD effectively addresses ambiguity in medical segmentation by learning voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical sampling efficiency through prior guidance and residual learning.

Abstract: Ambiguity in medical image segmentation calls for models that capture full
conditional distributions rather than a single point estimate. We present
Prior-Guided Residual Diffusion (PGRD), a diffusion-based framework that learns
voxel-wise distributions while maintaining strong calibration and practical
sampling efficiency. PGRD embeds discrete labels as one-hot targets in a
continuous space to align segmentation with diffusion modeling. A coarse prior
predictor provides step-wise guidance; the diffusion network then learns the
residual to the prior, accelerating convergence and improving calibration. A
deep diffusion supervision scheme further stabilizes training by supervising
intermediate time steps. Evaluated on representative MRI and CT datasets, PGRD
achieves higher Dice scores and lower NLL/ECE values than Bayesian, ensemble,
Probabilistic U-Net, and vanilla diffusion baselines, while requiring fewer
sampling steps to reach strong performance.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with higher accuracy on benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, YFCC4k), no fine-tuning required, scales seamlessly to new data.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented generation with multimodal LLMs provides effective alternative to traditional training-from-scratch methods, enabling more accessible and scalable GeoAI solutions.

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of
essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based
recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social
media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer
vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet
highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates
open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using
the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query
images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar
geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by
the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three
widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our
solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales
seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in
geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path
to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch,
opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

Conclusion: AgroSense provides practical, scalable solution for real-time precision agriculture decision support and enables future lightweight multimodal AI systems for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Meeting the increasing global demand for food security and sustainable
farming requires intelligent crop recommendation systems that operate in real
time. Traditional soil analysis techniques are often slow, labor-intensive, and
not suitable for on-field decision-making. To address these limitations, we
introduce AgroSense, a deep-learning framework that integrates soil image
classification and nutrient profiling to produce accurate and contextually
relevant crop recommendations. AgroSense comprises two main components: a Soil
Classification Module, which leverages ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and Vision
Transformer architectures to categorize soil types from images; and a Crop
Recommendation Module, which employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron, XGBoost,
LightGBM, and TabNet to analyze structured soil data, including nutrient
levels, pH, and rainfall. We curated a multimodal dataset of 10,000 paired
samples drawn from publicly available Kaggle repositories, approximately 50,000
soil images across seven classes, and 25,000 nutrient profiles for experimental
evaluation. The fused model achieves 98.0% accuracy, with a precision of 97.8%,
a recall of 97.7%, and an F1-score of 96.75%, while RMSE and MAE drop to 0.32
and 0.27, respectively. Ablation studies underscore the critical role of
multimodal coupling, and statistical validation via t-tests and ANOVA confirms
the significance of our improvements. AgroSense offers a practical, scalable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3Ret is a unified visual encoder that learns transferable representations for 2D, 3D, and video medical imaging data using self-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval across modalities without modality-specific customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical image retrieval methods are fragmented with separate architectures for different modalities (2D, 3D, video), which hampers scalability and prevents unified representation learning across medical imaging data types.

Method: Curated a large-scale hybrid-modality dataset of 867,653 medical imaging samples including 2D X-rays, ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Trained M3Ret using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO) self-supervised learning paradigms without any modality-specific customization.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual modalities, surpassing strong baselines like DINOv3 and BMC-CLIP. Demonstrated strong cross-modal alignment without paired data and generalization to unseen MRI tasks despite no MRI data in pretraining.

Conclusion: M3Ret represents a significant step toward foundation models for visual self-supervised learning in multimodal medical image understanding, showing that purely visual self-supervision can generalize to unseen modalities and deliver scalable, unified representations.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is essential for clinical decision-making and
translational research, relying on discriminative visual representations. Yet,
current methods remain fragmented, relying on separate architectures and
training strategies for 2D, 3D, and video-based medical data. This
modality-specific design hampers scalability and inhibits the development of
unified representations. To enable unified learning, we curate a large-scale
hybrid-modality dataset comprising 867,653 medical imaging samples, including
2D X-rays and ultrasounds, RGB endoscopy videos, and 3D CT scans. Leveraging
this dataset, we train M3Ret, a unified visual encoder without any
modality-specific customization. It successfully learns transferable
representations using both generative (MAE) and contrastive (SimDINO)
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms. Our approach sets a new
state-of-the-art in zero-shot image-to-image retrieval across all individual
modalities, surpassing strong baselines such as DINOv3 and the text-supervised
BMC-CLIP. More remarkably, strong cross-modal alignment emerges without paired
data, and the model generalizes to unseen MRI tasks, despite never observing
MRI during pretraining, demonstrating the generalizability of purely visual
self-supervision to unseen modalities. Comprehensive analyses further validate
the scalability of our framework across model and data sizes. These findings
deliver a promising signal to the medical imaging community, positioning M3Ret
as a step toward foundation models for visual SSL in multimodal medical image
understanding.

TL;DR: Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance Enhancement (TPIGE) framework for identity-preserving text-to-video generation that improves input quality and sampling guidance without fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and high tuning costs in identity-preserving text-to-video generation by developing a training-free approach that bridges semantic gaps between text prompts and reference images.

Method: Three-step framework: 1) Face Aware Prompt Enhancement using GPT-4o to add facial details, 2) Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement using identity-preserving image generator, 3) ID-Aware Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement with unified gradients during generation.

Result: Outperforms prior work, wins first place in ACM Multimedia 2025 Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, validated by automatic and human evaluations on 1000-video test set.

Conclusion: TPIGE achieves state-of-the-art identity-preserving video generation with minimal cost, demonstrating strong generality and performance without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation creates videos faithful
to both a reference subject image and a text prompt. While fine-tuning large
pretrained video diffusion models on ID-matched data achieves state-of-the-art
results on IPT2V, data scarcity and high tuning costs hinder broader
improvement. We thus introduce a Training-Free Prompt, Image, and Guidance
Enhancement (TPIGE) framework that bridges the semantic gap between the video
description and the reference image and design sampling guidance that enhances
identity preservation and video quality, achieving performance gains at minimal
cost.Specifically, we first propose Face Aware Prompt Enhancement, using GPT-4o
to enhance the text prompt with facial details derived from the reference
image. We then propose Prompt Aware Reference Image Enhancement, leveraging an
identity-preserving image generator to refine the reference image, rectifying
conflicts with the text prompt. The above mutual refinement significantly
improves input quality before video generation. Finally, we propose ID-Aware
Spatiotemporal Guidance Enhancement, utilizing unified gradients to optimize
identity preservation and video quality jointly during generation.Our method
outperforms prior work and is validated by automatic and human evaluations on a
1000 video test set, winning first place in the ACM Multimedia 2025
Identity-Preserving Video Generation Challenge, demonstrating state-of-the-art
performance and strong generality. The code is available at

Motivation: Existing real-time video analytics systems focus on static cameras, but steerable cameras with pan-tilt-zoom capabilities introduce scene dynamism that breaks traditional approaches like frame tiling.

Method: Uirapuru incorporates camera actuation understanding into system design and uses fast adaptive tiling at per-frame level to handle the dynamism of steerable cameras.

Result: The framework provides up to 1.45x accuracy improvement while respecting latency budgets, or up to 4.53x inference speedup with comparable accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Conclusion: Uirapuru successfully addresses the challenges of real-time analytics on steerable cameras by integrating camera movement awareness with adaptive processing techniques.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular
technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd
monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy
with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras.
In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based
video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed
by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a
critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To
address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of
camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a
per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset,
augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on
real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results
show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while
respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup
with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

(LIE) methods struggle with the unique challenges of aerial imagery, including
Ultra-High Resolution (UHR), lack of paired data, severe non-uniform
illumination, and deployment constraints. To address these issues, we propose
three key contributions. First, we present U3D, the first unsupervised UHR UAV
dataset for LIE, with a unified evaluation toolkit. Second, we introduce the
Edge Efficiency Index (EEI), a novel metric balancing perceptual quality with
key deployment factors: speed, resolution, model complexity, and memory
footprint. Third, we develop U3LIE, an efficient framework with two
training-only designs-Adaptive Pre-enhancement Augmentation (APA) for input
normalization and a Luminance Interval Loss (L_int) for exposure control. U3LIE
achieves SOTA results, processing 4K images at 23.8 FPS on a single GPU, making
it ideal for real-time on-board deployment. In summary, these contributions
provide a holistic solution (dataset, metric, and method) for advancing robust
24/7 UAV vision. The code and datasets are available at

### [265] [Enhancing Partially Relevant Video Retrieval with Robust Alignment Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01383)
*Long Zhang,Peipei Song,Jianfeng Dong,Kun Li,Xun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAL framework uses probabilistic modeling with Gaussian distributions and confidence gates to handle data uncertainty in partially relevant video retrieval, improving robustness against spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods are vulnerable to distractor videos due to query ambiguity and partial video relevance, which create spurious semantic correlations and contextual noise in cross-modal alignment.

Method: Proposes Robust Alignment Learning (RAL) with two key innovations: 1) probabilistic modeling encoding videos/queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions for uncertainty quantification and proxy-level matching, 2) learnable confidence gates to dynamically weight similarity based on query word informativeness.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate RAL's effectiveness as a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing architectures.

Conclusion: RAL successfully addresses the core challenge of data uncertainty in PRVR through probabilistic modeling and dynamic confidence weighting, providing robust query-video alignment against spurious correlations.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos
partially relevant to a given query. The core challenge lies in learning robust
query-video alignment against spurious semantic correlations arising from
inherent data uncertainty: 1) query ambiguity, where the query incompletely
characterizes the target video and often contains uninformative tokens, and 2)
partial video relevance, where abundant query-irrelevant segments introduce
contextual noise in cross-modal alignment. Existing methods often focus on
enhancing multi-scale clip representations and retrieving the most relevant
clip. However, the inherent data uncertainty in PRVR renders them vulnerable to
distractor videos with spurious similarities, leading to suboptimal
performance. To fill this research gap, we propose Robust Alignment Learning
(RAL) framework, which explicitly models the uncertainty in data. Key
innovations include: 1) we pioneer probabilistic modeling for PRVR by encoding
videos and queries as multivariate Gaussian distributions. This not only
quantifies data uncertainty but also enables proxy-level matching to capture
the variability in cross-modal correspondences; 2) we consider the
heterogeneous informativeness of query words and introduce learnable confidence
gates to dynamically weight similarity. As a plug-and-play solution, RAL can be
seamlessly integrated into the existing architectures. Extensive experiments
across diverse retrieval backbones demonstrate its effectiveness.

### [266] [RibPull: Implicit Occupancy Fields and Medial Axis Extraction for CT Ribcage Scans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01402)
*Emmanouil Nikolakakis,Amine Ouasfi,Julie Digne,Razvan Marinescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RibPull uses neural occupancy fields to represent ribcages from CT scans as continuous implicit functions, enabling better handling of sparse data and geometric operations like medial axis extraction compared to voxel-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel grids in medical imaging suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and inefficient handling of sparse data. Implicit 3D representations using continuous functions can better handle sparse and noisy data while preserving complex geometrical information.

Method: Uses neural occupancy fields to predict whether 3D points lie inside or outside ribcage objects from CT scans. Applies Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of ribcages, demonstrating geometric operations that benefit from continuous coordinate-based representations.

Result: Evaluated on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset (extension of RibFrac dataset). The method effectively represents CT-scanned ribcages and enables successful extraction of medial axes through continuous implicit representations.

Conclusion: Implicit occupancy fields provide superior representation for sparse medical imaging data compared to voxel-based methods, enabling complex geometric operations like medial axis extraction while compensating for sparse signals through continuous coordinate-based 3D scene representations.

Abstract: We present RibPull, a methodology that utilizes implicit occupancy fields to
bridge computational geometry and medical imaging. Implicit 3D representations
use continuous functions that handle sparse and noisy data more effectively
than discrete methods. While voxel grids are standard for medical imaging, they
suffer from resolution limitations, topological information loss, and
inefficient handling of sparsity. Coordinate functions preserve complex
geometrical information and represent a better solution for sparse data
representation, while allowing for further morphological operations. Implicit
scene representations enable neural networks to encode entire 3D scenes within
their weights. The result is a continuous function that can implicitly
compesate for sparse signals and infer further information about the 3D scene
by passing any combination of 3D coordinates as input to the model. In this
work, we use neural occupancy fields that predict whether a 3D point lies
inside or outside an object to represent CT-scanned ribcages. We also apply a
Laplacian-based contraction to extract the medial axis of the ribcage, thus
demonstrating a geometrical operation that benefits greatly from continuous
coordinate-based 3D scene representations versus voxel-based representations.
We evaluate our methodology on 20 medical scans from the RibSeg dataset, which
is itself an extension of the RibFrac dataset. We will release our code upon
publication.

### [267] [Neural Scene Designer: Self-Styled Semantic Image Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01405)
*Jianman Lin,Tianshui Chen,Chunmei Qing,Zhijing Yang,Shuangping Huang,Yuheng Ren,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSD is a novel framework for photo-realistic image editing that maintains both semantic alignment with user intent and stylistic consistency with surrounding environment using parallel cross-attention mechanisms and progressive style learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing methods focus primarily on semantic control but neglect stylistic consistency, which is crucial for cohesive and aesthetically appealing images.

Method: Uses Neural Scene Designer (NSD) framework with advanced diffusion model featuring two parallel cross-attention mechanisms for text and style processing. Includes Progressive Self-style Representational Learning (PSRL) module with style contrastive loss to learn fine-grained style representations.

Result: Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark show the framework's effectiveness in achieving both semantic control and style consistency.

Conclusion: NSD successfully addresses the critical task of preserving stylistic consistency in image editing while maintaining semantic alignment, establishing a new standard for this challenging problem.

Abstract: Maintaining stylistic consistency is crucial for the cohesion and aesthetic
appeal of images, a fundamental requirement in effective image editing and
inpainting. However, existing methods primarily focus on the semantic control
of generated content, often neglecting the critical task of preserving this
consistency. In this work, we introduce the Neural Scene Designer (NSD), a
novel framework that enables photo-realistic manipulation of user-specified
scene regions while ensuring both semantic alignment with user intent and
stylistic consistency with the surrounding environment. NSD leverages an
advanced diffusion model, incorporating two parallel cross-attention mechanisms
that separately process text and style information to achieve the dual
objectives of semantic control and style consistency. To capture fine-grained
style representations, we propose the Progressive Self-style Representational
Learning (PSRL) module. This module is predicated on the intuitive premise that
different regions within a single image share a consistent style, whereas
regions from different images exhibit distinct styles. The PSRL module employs
a style contrastive loss that encourages high similarity between
representations from the same image while enforcing dissimilarity between those
from different images. Furthermore, to address the lack of standardized
evaluation protocols for this task, we establish a comprehensive benchmark.
This benchmark includes competing algorithms, dedicated style-related metrics,
and diverse datasets and settings to facilitate fair comparisons. Extensive
experiments conducted on our benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

### [268] [MILO: A Lightweight Perceptual Quality Metric for Image and Latent-Space Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01411)
*Uğur Çoğalan,Mojtaba Bemana,Karol Myszkowski,Hans-Peter Seidel,Colin Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILO is a lightweight perceptual metric for image quality assessment that outperforms existing methods and can be used as a perceptual loss for image optimization tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient image quality assessment metric that doesn't require large human-labeled datasets and can serve as a perceptual loss function for image optimization tasks.

Method: Trained using pseudo-MOS supervision with reproducible distortions scored by an ensemble of quality metrics, incorporates spatial masking, and uses curriculum learning for optimization in both image and latent spaces.

Result: Outperforms existing metrics across standard benchmarks, enables efficient perceptual optimization for tasks like denoising and super-resolution, and reduces computational overhead.

Conclusion: MILO serves as both a state-of-the-art image quality metric and a practical tool for perceptual optimization in generative pipelines.

Abstract: We present MILO (Metric for Image- and Latent-space Optimization), a
lightweight, multiscale, perceptual metric for full-reference image quality
assessment (FR-IQA). MILO is trained using pseudo-MOS (Mean Opinion Score)
supervision, in which reproducible distortions are applied to diverse images
and scored via an ensemble of recent quality metrics that account for visual
masking effects. This approach enables accurate learning without requiring
large-scale human-labeled datasets. Despite its compact architecture, MILO
outperforms existing metrics across standard FR-IQA benchmarks and offers fast
inference suitable for real-time applications. Beyond quality prediction, we
demonstrate the utility of MILO as a perceptual loss in both image and latent
domains. In particular, we show that spatial masking modeled by MILO, when
applied to latent representations from a VAE encoder within Stable Diffusion,
enables efficient and perceptually aligned optimization. By combining spatial
masking with a curriculum learning strategy, we first process perceptually less
relevant regions before progressively shifting the optimization to more
visually distorted areas. This strategy leads to significantly improved
performance in tasks like denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration,
while also reducing computational overhead. MILO thus functions as both a
state-of-the-art image quality metric and as a practical tool for perceptual
optimization in generative pipelines.

TL;DR: A modified YOLOv8-based system for accurate calorie estimation of Bangladeshi street foods, achieving 6.94 MAE and 96.0% R^2 score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations in existing automated calorie tracking systems that struggle with multiple food recognition, image scaling issues, and Western cuisine bias, particularly for Bangladeshi street foods.

Method: Constructed a diverse Bangladeshi street food dataset, modified YOLOv8 for improved classification and segmentation, and integrated with a machine learning regression model for calorie estimation.

Result: Achieved 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root mean squared error (RMSE), and 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation with only slight computational complexity increase.

Conclusion: The proposed system provides highly effective and accurate real-world calorie calculation specifically tailored for Bangladeshi street foods, overcoming previous limitations in the field.

Abstract: As obesity rates continue to increase, automated calorie tracking has become
a vital tool for people seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle or adhere to a
diet plan. Although numerous research efforts have addressed this issue,
existing approaches often face key limitations, such as providing only constant
caloric output, struggling with multiple food recognition challenges,
challenges in image scaling and normalization, and a predominant focus on
Western cuisines. In this paper, we propose a tailored solution that
specifically targets Bangladeshi street food. We first construct a diverse
dataset of popular street foods found across Bangladesh. Then, we develop a
refined calorie estimation system by modifying the state-of-the-art vision
model YOLOv8. Our modified model achieves superior classification and
segmentation results, with only a slight increase in computational complexity
compared to the base variant. Coupled with a machine learning regression model,
our system achieves an impressive 6.94 mean absolute error (MAE), 11.03 root
mean squared error (RMSE), and a 96.0% R^2 score in calorie estimation, making
it both highly effective and accurate for real-world food calorie calculations.

### [270] [InfoScale: Unleashing Training-free Variable-scaled Image Generation via Effective Utilization of Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01421)
*Guohui Zhang,Jiangtong Tan,Linjiang Huang,Zhonghang Yuan,Naishan Zheng,Jie Huang,Feng Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfoScale is a plug-and-play framework that addresses three key information-related challenges in diffusion models for variable-scale image generation: frequency loss from dilated convolution, inflexible attention aggregation, and misaligned noise distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer performance degradation when generating images at resolutions different from their training scale due to information handling issues across varying resolutions.

Method: Proposes three modules: Progressive Frequency Compensation for high-frequency information loss, Adaptive Information Aggregation for flexible attention mechanisms, and Noise Adaptation for proper initial noise distribution alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation, showing improved performance across different resolutions.

Conclusion: InfoScale provides an information-centric solution that effectively addresses the core challenges in variable-scale image generation with diffusion models through targeted module designs.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer
performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training
scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating
variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across
resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for
generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of
three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled
generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise.
Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution
generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled
image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3)
The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with
variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose
\textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image
generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects
correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency
Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by
dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information
aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation
module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and
achieve an effective balance between local and global information in
higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3),
we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise
for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and
extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image
generation.

Conclusion: The combination of CNNs with selective SSMs shows synergistic potential and presents a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced visual understanding tasks.

Abstract: The computational assessment of facial attractiveness, a challenging
subjective regression task, is dominated by architectures with a critical
trade-off: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) offer efficiency but have
limited receptive fields, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) model global context
at a quadratic computational cost. To address this, we propose Mamba-CNN, a
novel and efficient hybrid architecture. Mamba-CNN integrates a lightweight,
Mamba-inspired State Space Model (SSM) gating mechanism into a hierarchical
convolutional backbone. This core innovation allows the network to dynamically
modulate feature maps and selectively emphasize salient facial features and
their long-range spatial relationships, mirroring human holistic perception
while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted extensive experiments
on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, where our model sets a new
state-of-the-art. Mamba-CNN achieves a Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9187, a
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.2022, and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of
0.2610. Our findings validate the synergistic potential of combining CNNs with
selective SSMs and present a powerful new architectural paradigm for nuanced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of publicly available datasets for sports video summarization, particularly for soccer highlight generation, to support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing manual effort.

Method: Created a curated dataset using broadcast footage from SoccerNet with shot boundaries for 237 matches across Spanish, French, and Italian leagues. Developed a baseline model specifically designed for soccer video summarization.

Result: The baseline model achieved an F1 score of 0.3956 on the test set. A new length-constrained evaluation metric was proposed for more objective assessment of generated summaries.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset serves as a benchmark for soccer video summarization, and the proposed baseline model and evaluation metric provide foundations for future research in automated sports highlight generation.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce
concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in
sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game,
along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary
generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing
the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of
publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for
sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing
a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a
benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches
from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced
from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model
specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in
the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of
each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated
content. The dataset and code are available at

TL;DR: Novel 3D hair reconstruction method combining synthetic and real data training with transformer-based prior and Gaussian splatting for single/multi-image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with capturing complete 3D hair structure from single images due to lack of ground truth data and limitations of synthetic-only training data.

Method: Transformer-based prior model trained on synthetic data for internal geometry, combined with real data for outer structure modeling, using Gaussian splatting for reconstruction from one or more images.

Result: Superior performance in capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and backside consistency compared to existing reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach using both synthetic and real data effectively addresses limitations of previous methods, enabling high-quality 3D hair reconstruction from single photographs.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for 3D hair reconstruction from single
photographs based on a global hair prior combined with local optimization.
Capturing strand-based hair geometry from single photographs is challenging due
to the variety and geometric complexity of hairstyles and the lack of ground
truth training data. Classical reconstruction methods like multi-view stereo
only reconstruct the visible hair strands, missing the inner structure of
hairstyles and hampering realistic hair simulation. To address this, existing
methods leverage hairstyle priors trained on synthetic data. Such data,
however, is limited in both quantity and quality since it requires manual work
from skilled artists to model the 3D hairstyles and create near-photorealistic
renderings. To address this, we propose a novel approach that uses both, real
and synthetic data to learn an effective hairstyle prior. Specifically, we
train a transformer-based prior model on synthetic data to obtain knowledge of
the internal hairstyle geometry and introduce real data in the learning process
to model the outer structure. This training scheme is able to model the visible
hair strands depicted in an input image, while preserving the general 3D
structure of hairstyles. We exploit this prior to create a
Gaussian-splatting-based reconstruction method that creates hairstyles from one
or more images. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing
reconstruction pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance
of our method for capturing detailed hair orientation, overall silhouette, and
backside consistency. For additional results and code, please refer to

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointSlice: A novel point cloud processing method that slices 3D point clouds into 2D horizontal slices and uses a Slice Interaction Network to maintain vertical relationships, achieving high speed and accuracy for 3D object detection in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current voxel-based methods offer high accuracy but slow inference, while pillar-based methods are faster but less accurate. There's a need for a method that balances both speed and accuracy in 3D point cloud processing for autonomous driving applications.

Method: Proposes PointSlice which converts 3D point clouds into multiple 2D (x-y) data slices and treats them as separate batches of 2D data. Introduces Slice Interaction Network (SIN) to maintain vertical relationships across slices within the 2D backbone network.

Result: Achieves 1.13x faster speed and 0.79x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art SAFDNet on Waymo with only 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. Achieves 66.74 mAP on nuScenes (state-of-the-art) and 1.10x faster speed with 0.66x fewer parameters on Argoverse 2 with 1.0 mAP reduction.

Conclusion: PointSlice effectively balances detection accuracy and inference speed by processing 3D point clouds as 2D slices while maintaining vertical relationships through SIN, making it suitable for real-time autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: 3D object detection from point clouds plays a critical role in autonomous
driving. Currently, the primary methods for point cloud processing are
voxel-based and pillarbased approaches. Voxel-based methods offer high accuracy
through fine-grained spatial segmentation but suffer from slower inference
speeds. Pillar-based methods enhance inference speed but still fall short of
voxel-based methods in accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel
point cloud processing method, PointSlice, which slices point clouds along the
horizontal plane and includes a dedicated detection network. The main
contributions of PointSlice are: (1) A new point cloud processing technique
that converts 3D point clouds into multiple sets of 2D (x-y) data slices. The
model only learns 2D data distributions, treating the 3D point cloud as
separate batches of 2D data, which reduces the number of model parameters and
enhances inference speed; (2) The introduction of a Slice Interaction Network
(SIN). To maintain vertical relationships across slices, we incorporate SIN
into the 2D backbone network, which improves the model's 3D object perception
capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSlice achieves high
detection accuracy and inference speed. On the Waymo dataset, PointSlice is
1.13x faster and has 0.79x fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art
voxel-based method (SAFDNet), with only a 1.2 mAPH accuracy reduction. On the
nuScenes dataset, we achieve a state-of-the-art detection result of 66.74 mAP.
On the Argoverse 2 dataset, PointSlice is 1.10x faster, with 0.66x fewer
parameters and a 1.0 mAP accuracy reduction. The code will be available at

Conclusion: ConTiCoM-3D establishes a practical framework for scalable 3D shape generation with high geometric fidelity and fast generation capabilities.

Abstract: Fast and accurate 3D shape generation from point clouds is essential for
applications in robotics, AR/VR, and digital content creation. We introduce
ConTiCoM-3D, a continuous-time consistency model that synthesizes 3D shapes
directly in point space, without discretized diffusion steps, pre-trained
teacher models, or latent-space encodings. The method integrates a
TrigFlow-inspired continuous noise schedule with a Chamfer Distance-based
geometric loss, enabling stable training on high-dimensional point sets while
avoiding expensive Jacobian-vector products. This design supports efficient
one- to two-step inference with high geometric fidelity. In contrast to
previous approaches that rely on iterative denoising or latent decoders,
ConTiCoM-3D employs a time-conditioned neural network operating entirely in
continuous time, thereby achieving fast generation. Experiments on the ShapeNet

*Chao Deng,Xiaosen Li,Xiao Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSA2-Net introduces Self-Adaptive Convolution Module to dynamically adjust convolution kernel sizes based on dataset characteristics, improving medical image segmentation performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: nnUNet automatically tunes most hyperparameters but overlooks internal network hyperparameters, limiting model generalization. This study addresses this limitation by developing adaptive convolution kernels.

Method: Proposes Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts convolution kernel sizes. Integrated into Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge (refines CSWin Transformer outputs) and Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder (captures organ details).

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 86.49% (Synapse), 92.56% (ACDC), 93.37% (Kvasir), and 92.98% (ISIC2017), demonstrating robust performance across diverse medical image datasets.

Conclusion: MSA2-Net with Self-Adaptive Convolution Module significantly improves segmentation accuracy by capturing both global and local features, showing strong generalization across various medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in
training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal
hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the
model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents
a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of
the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different
datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module,
to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps.
Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key
components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the
Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the
ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during
the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could
potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder,
utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs
varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the
decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature
maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by
this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving

TL;DR: V²Drop is a token compression method that removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM inference, maintaining high performance while significantly reducing latency and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image and long-video understanding in LVLMs results in substantial token counts, reducing inference efficiency. Existing token compression methods suffer from positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators.

Method: Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (V²Drop) progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM inference, leveraging the task-agnostic properties of visual token variations within LLMs.

Result: Maintains 94.0% of original performance for image understanding and 98.6% for video understanding, while reducing LLM generation latency by 31.5% and 74.2% respectively. Further reduces GPU peak memory when combined with efficient operators.

Conclusion: V²Drop provides an effective token compression solution that addresses limitations of existing methods, significantly improving computational efficiency while preserving model performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding tasks. However, the increasing demand
for high-resolution image and long-video understanding results in substantial
token counts, leading to reduced inference efficiency. Token compression offers
a direct solution by reducing the number of tokens to be processed, thereby
improving computational efficiency. Through extensive analysis, we identify two
critical limitations in existing inner-LLM token compression methods:
positional bias and incompatibility with efficient operators, which hinder
their practical deployment for LVLM acceleration. This paper presents the first
approach from a token variation perspective, revealing that visual token
variations within LLMs exhibit task-agnostic properties. We propose
Variation-aware Vision Token Dropping (\textit{i.e.}, \textbf{V$^2$Drop}),
which progressively removes visual tokens with minimal variation during LVLM
inference, thereby enhancing computational efficiency. Extensive experiments
across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that our V$^2$Drop is able to
maintain \textbf{94.0\%} and \textbf{98.6\%} of the original model performance
for image and video understanding tasks respectively, while reducing LLM
generation latency by \textbf{31.5\%} and \textbf{74.2\%}. When combined with
efficient operators, V$^2$Drop further reduces GPU peak memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs lack discriminative precision for reliable clinical use in radiology, and there's scarcity/heterogeneity of publicly available volumetric CT datasets with varying annotation formats.

Method: Uniferum harmonizes three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations into a single training framework that unifies classification labels and segmentation masks as supervision signals.

Result: Achieves 7% AUROC improvement on CT-RATE benchmark compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label models, with robust out-of-distribution generalization and unexpected zero-shot performance on RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating heterogeneous annotations and body segmentation effectively enhances model performance, setting a new direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools
in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large
labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology,
these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable
clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of
publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation
formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a
volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in
classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework.
By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum
achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark
by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models.
The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed
evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT
datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous
annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new
direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HIFU-ILDiff is a deep learning approach using latent diffusion models to remove HIFU-induced interference from ultrasound images, achieving superior denoising performance and real-time processing compared to traditional Notch Filter methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time monitoring is crucial for HIFU treatment success and safety, but ultrasound guidance is often hindered by HIFU-induced interference, necessitating effective denoising methods.

Method: Uses Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images into latent space, followed by latent diffusion model to iteratively remove interference, then decodes to reconstruct clean images.

Result: Achieved SSIM of 0.796 and PSNR of 23.780 (vs 0.443 and 14.420 for Notch Filter) with real-time processing at 15 fps (vs 5 seconds per frame for Notch Filter).

Conclusion: HIFU-ILDiff effectively denoises HIFU interference for real-time monitoring during therapy, significantly improving treatment precision in clinical applications.

Abstract: High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a non-invasive therapeutic
technique widely used for treating various diseases. However, the success and
safety of HIFU treatments depend on real-time monitoring, which is often
hindered by interference when using ultrasound to guide HIFU treatment. To
address these challenges, we developed HIFU-ILDiff, a novel deep learning-based
approach leveraging latent diffusion models to suppress HIFU-induced
interference in ultrasound images. The HIFU-ILDiff model employs a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to encode noisy ultrasound images
into a lower-dimensional latent space, followed by a latent diffusion model
that iteratively removes interference. The denoised latent vectors are then
decoded to reconstruct high-resolution, interference-free ultrasound images. We
constructed a comprehensive dataset comprising 18,872 image pairs from in vitro
phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and in vivo animal data across multiple imaging
modalities and HIFU power levels to train and evaluate the model. Experimental
results demonstrate that HIFU-ILDiff significantly outperforms the commonly
used Notch Filter method, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of
0.796 and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 23.780 compared to SSIM of 0.443
and PSNR of 14.420 for the Notch Filter under in vitro scenarios. Additionally,
HIFU-ILDiff achieves real-time processing at 15 frames per second, markedly
faster than the Notch Filter's 5 seconds per frame. These findings indicate
that HIFU-ILDiff is able to denoise HIFU interference in ultrasound guiding
images for real-time monitoring during HIFU therapy, which will greatly improve
the treatment precision in current clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video understanding remains challenging for MLLMs due to the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal coverage in processing dynamic, information-dense video content.

Method: Three key innovations: 1) Slow-Fast video encoding that dynamically allocates resources based on frame similarity, 2) Progressive 4-stage pre-training extending context length from 8K to 128K tokens, 3) Comprehensive post-training with chain-of-thought data, GSPO-based RL, and alignment training.

Result: Significant improvements over existing models on public benchmarks and internal human assessments, particularly excelling in video understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Keye-VL-1.5 successfully addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through its three innovative approaches, demonstrating superior video understanding capabilities in MLLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has
significantly advanced, extending their capabilities to multimodal tasks
through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, video understanding
remains a challenging area due to the dynamic and information-dense nature of
videos. Existing models struggle with the trade-off between spatial resolution
and temporal coverage when processing video content. We present Keye-VL-1.5,
which addresses fundamental challenges in video comprehension through three key
innovations. First, we introduce a novel Slow-Fast video encoding strategy that
dynamically allocates computational resources based on inter-frame similarity,
processing key frames with significant visual changes at higher resolution
(Slow pathway) while handling relatively static frames with increased temporal
coverage at lower resolution (Fast pathway). Second, we implement a progressive
four-stage pre-training methodology that systematically extends the model's
context length from 8K to 128K tokens, enabling processing of longer videos and
more complex visual content. Third, we develop a comprehensive post-training
pipeline focusing on reasoning enhancement and human preference alignment,
incorporating a 5-step chain-of-thought data construction process, iterative
GSPO-based reinforcement learning with progressive prompt hinting for difficult
cases, and alignment training. Through extensive evaluation on public
benchmarks and rigorous internal human assessment, Keye-VL-1.5 demonstrates
significant improvements over existing models, particularly excelling in video
understanding tasks while maintaining competitive performance on general
multimodal benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a broadly applicable visual SLAM system that doesn't require camera calibration parameters (intrinsics) and can work across diverse camera setups with reduced computational complexity.

Method: Uses a symmetric two-view association (STA) model as frontend to estimate relative camera poses and regress local pointmaps from two RGB images. Backend employs a Sim(3) pose graph with loop closures to handle accumulated drift.

Result: Achieves superior performance in camera tracking and dense 3D reconstruction quality compared to current methods, with frontend model size only 35% of comparable state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: ViSTA-SLAM demonstrates that lightweight two-view association models can effectively replace traditional feature-based methods while eliminating the need for camera calibration, making visual SLAM more accessible across diverse camera setups.

Abstract: We present ViSTA-SLAM as a real-time monocular visual SLAM system that
operates without requiring camera intrinsics, making it broadly applicable
across diverse camera setups. At its core, the system employs a lightweight
symmetric two-view association (STA) model as the frontend, which
simultaneously estimates relative camera poses and regresses local pointmaps
from only two RGB images. This design reduces model complexity significantly,
the size of our frontend is only 35\% that of comparable state-of-the-art
methods, while enhancing the quality of two-view constraints used in the
pipeline. In the backend, we construct a specially designed Sim(3) pose graph
that incorporates loop closures to address accumulated drift. Extensive

Motivation: Current video editing methods require different control signals for different editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training resources. There's a need for a unified approach that can handle diverse object property manipulations.

Method: Proposes O-DisCo-Edit framework with novel object distortion control (O-DisCo) signal based on random and adaptive noise, paired with a "copy-form" preservation module to maintain non-edited regions. Uses an effective training paradigm.

Result: Extensive experiments and human evaluations show O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods across various video editing tasks, enabling efficient and high-fidelity editing.

Conclusion: O-DisCo-Edit provides a unified solution for controllable video editing that flexibly handles diverse editing cues within a single representation, outperforming existing methods while being more efficient.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable

within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module
for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient,
high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive
experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel stereo Vision Transformer model that processes dual X-ray images as separate sequences for simultaneous catheter segmentation and 3D force estimation, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance catheterization procedures by providing improved tactile and visual perception through a more effective end-to-end architecture that captures long-range dependencies between stereo X-ray images without needing gradual receptive field expansion.

Method: Proposes an encoder-decoder Vision Transformer that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences of patches. Uses shared segmentation heads for both encoder and decoder embeddings, and a regression head with fused decoder information for 3D force estimation.

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and multitask approaches. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both catheter segmentation and force estimation across various noise levels in synthetic X-ray images.

Conclusion: The stereo Vision Transformer approach successfully captures long-range dependencies between dual X-ray perspectives, enabling superior simultaneous catheter segmentation and 3D force estimation compared to existing CNN-based and multitask methods.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced
catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data
through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a
segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray
images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the
image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based
encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two
viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation
of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem
from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer
model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given
sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures
long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive
field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and
decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head
employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The
proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously
segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces
at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic
X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against
state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force
estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation
approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in
both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Motivation: Traditional alignment methods rely on expensive human-curated preference data, while machine-generated data has quality issues and self-supervised methods introduce hallucinations.

Method: A collaborative learning framework where a panel of LVLMs generate, assess, and refine outputs through iterative peer review process, simulating classroom learning.

Result: Significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, increasing average score from 48% to 57% on fifteen benchmarks.

Conclusion: Peer evaluations provide a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment, enhancing model performance without requiring extensive human-labeled datasets.

Abstract: Traditional alignment methods for Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs)
primarily rely on human-curated preference data. Human-generated preference
data is costly; machine-generated preference data is limited in quality; and
self-supervised preference data often introduces hallucinations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel Panel-of-Peers learning framework
inspired by collaborative learning among humans. This approach leverages a
panel of LVLMs, each evaluating and learning from their collective outputs
through an iterative self-improvement process. By simulating a peer review
system, our models generate, assess, and refine outputs in response to a
curated set of prompts, mimicking a classroom learning environment. We
demonstrate that this methodology enhances model performance without requiring
extensive human-labeled datasets. Our experiments show significant improvement
across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of peer evaluations as
a scalable alternative to self-supervised alignment. Notably, we show that
Panel-of-Peers increases the average score on fifteen benchmarks from 48% to

### [286] [Q-Sched: Pushing the Boundaries of Few-Step Diffusion Models with Quantization-Aware Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01624)
*Natalia Frumkin,Diana Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Sched is a post-training quantization method that modifies diffusion model schedulers instead of weights, achieving 4x model size reduction while maintaining full-precision accuracy through quantization-aware scheduling adjustments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally expensive, requiring dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. Existing few-step models still depend on large, uncompressed backbones that are costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs, limiting quantization methods that require full-precision calibration.

Method: Q-Sched modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights by adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory. It uses JAQ loss (combining text-image compatibility with image quality metric) for learning quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, requiring only a handful of calibration prompts without full-precision inference during calibration.

Result: Achieves 4x reduction in model size while maintaining full-precision accuracy. Shows 15.5% FID improvement over FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and 16.6% improvement over FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model. Large-scale user study with 80,000+ annotations confirms effectiveness on FLUX.1 and SDXL-Turbo.

Conclusion: Q-Sched demonstrates that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation, providing a practical solution for efficient text-to-image generation without compromising quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring
dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance,
Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a
2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step
diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on
large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often
too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These
requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely
on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for
post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather
than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched
achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn
quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss,
which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for
fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of
calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration.
Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16
4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step
Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation
are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with
more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both
FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

TL;DR: OpenVision 2 simplifies the original architecture by removing text encoder and contrastive loss, using only captioning loss, achieving competitive performance with significantly improved training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance training efficiency of vision-language models by simplifying architecture while maintaining performance, following trends from CapPa, AIMv2 and LLaVA.

Method: Removed text encoder and contrastive loss, retained only captioning loss as generative training signal, creating a purely generative training paradigm.

Result: Reduced training time by 1.5x (83h to 57h), memory usage by 1.8x (24.5GB to 13.8GB), increased batch size from 2k to 8k, scaled to over 1B parameters while maintaining competitive benchmark performance.

Conclusion: The lightweight generative-only paradigm is compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation models due to superior training efficiency.

Abstract: This paper provides a simplification on OpenVision's architecture and loss
design for enhancing its training efficiency. Following the prior
vision-language pretraining works CapPa and AIMv2, as well as modern multimodal
designs like LLaVA, our changes are straightforward: we remove the text encoder
(and therefore the contrastive loss), retaining only the captioning loss as a
purely generative training signal. We name this new version OpenVision 2. The
initial results are promising: despite this simplification, OpenVision 2
competitively matches the original model's performance on a broad set of
multimodal benchmarks while substantially cutting both training time and memory
consumption. For example, with ViT-L/14, it reduces training time by about 1.5x
(from 83h to 57h), and memory usage by about 1.8x (from 24.5GB to 13.8GB,
equivalently allowing the maximum batch size to grow from 2k to 8k). This
superior training efficiency also allows us to scale far beyond the largest
vision encoder used in OpenVision, reaching more than 1 billion parameters. We
hold a strong belief that this lightweight, generative-only paradigm is
compelling for future vision encoder development in multimodal foundation
models.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning effectively enhances multi-modal LLMs' visual tool usage and reasoning capabilities, providing new insights for RL-based visual tool usage through extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, a cornerstone of human intelligence, encompasses complex
perceptual and logical processes essential for solving diverse visual problems.
While advances in computer vision have produced powerful models for various
perceptual tasks, leveraging these for general visual reasoning remains
challenging. Prior work demonstrates that augmenting LLMs with vision models
via supervised finetuning improves performance, but faces key limitations such
as expensive data generation, reliance on careful data filtering, and poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose ReVPT to enhance
multi-modal LLMs' abilities to reason about and use visual tools through
reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel RL algorithm based on GRPO,
designed to train models to reason with a suite of four visual tools. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several perception-heavy benchmarks, including SAT, CV-Bench,

Abstract: Photorealistic and controllable human avatars have gained popularity in the

the presence of noticeable blurring. To solve this problem, we propose

Motivation: Address high dimensionality challenges in multispectral image data and complexity of multi-label classification where each image can belong to multiple classes.

Result: Effectiveness of PCA varies significantly based on the chosen deep learning architecture and training approach.

Conclusion: Findings open avenues for future research into self-supervised pre-training and alternative dimensionality reduction methods for multispectral image classification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the utility of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for
multi-label classification of multispectral images using ResNet50 and DINOv2,
acknowledging the high dimensionality of such data and the associated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CNSCA, an enhanced ConvNeXt-based deep learning model with self-attention and channel attention mechanisms for improved rock size classification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rock size classification is crucial for geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management as it impacts operational efficiency and safety.

Method: Enhanced ConvNeXt architecture augmented with self-attention for long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention for informative feature emphasis, creating a hybrid CNSCA model.

Result: The model outperformed three strong baselines on rock size classification dataset, demonstrating significant improvement in classification accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: Incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances model capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures like rocks.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical
engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation
influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with
both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the
foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces
self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention
to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model
to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual
relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy
and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and
compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the
incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models
capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures
like rocks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage diffusion framework using clinical metadata guidance for limited-angle CT reconstruction, achieving superior image quality with physics-based consistency enforcement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited-angle CT suffers from severe artifacts due to truncated projections, requiring methods to address the ill-posed reconstruction problem while leveraging available clinical information.

Method: Two-stage transformer-based diffusion model: first stage generates coarse anatomical priors from metadata only; second stage refines images using both metadata and coarse priors. Physics-based consistency enforced via ADMM at each sampling step.

Result: Significant improvement in reconstruction fidelity under severe angular truncation. Superior performance in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC compared to metadata-free baselines. Different metadata types provide complementary benefits.

Conclusion: Clinical metadata plays dual role in improving reconstruction quality and efficiency, supporting integration into future metadata-guided medical imaging frameworks.

Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers improved temporal resolution
and reduced radiation dose for cardiac imaging, but suffers from severe
artifacts due to truncated projections. To address the ill-posedness of LACT
reconstruction, we propose a two-stage diffusion framework guided by structured
clinical metadata. In the first stage, a transformer-based diffusion model
conditioned exclusively on metadata, including acquisition parameters, patient
demographics, and diagnostic impressions, generates coarse anatomical priors
from noise. The second stage further refines the images by integrating both the
coarse prior and metadata to produce high-fidelity results. Physics-based data
consistency is enforced at each sampling step in both stages using an
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers module, ensuring alignment with the
measured projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real cardiac
CT datasets demonstrate that incorporating metadata significantly improves
reconstruction fidelity, particularly under severe angular truncation. Compared
to existing metadata-free baselines, our method achieves superior performance
in SSIM, PSNR, nMI, and PCC. Ablation studies confirm that different types of
metadata contribute complementary benefits, particularly diagnostic and
demographic priors under limited-angle conditions. These findings highlight the
dual role of clinical metadata in improving both reconstruction quality and
efficiency, supporting their integration into future metadata-guided medical
imaging frameworks.

*Yifan Lan,Xin Cai,Jun Cheng,Shan Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Balanced Information Bottleneck (BIB) and Mixture of BIBs (MBIB) for long-tailed visual recognition, integrating loss re-balancing and self-distillation into information bottleneck framework to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world visual recognition data is typically long-tailed, creating challenges for DNN training and deployment, while standard information bottleneck approaches need adaptation for imbalanced data scenarios.

Method: BIB integrates loss function re-balancing and self-distillation techniques into original IB network. MBIB extends this with multiple BIBs combining knowledge from different network layers, enabling end-to-end simultaneous representation and classification learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed datasets including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

Conclusion: The proposed BIB and MBIB approaches effectively address long-tailed visual recognition by preserving essential label-related information through information bottleneck principles with re-balancing techniques.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved significant success in various
applications with large-scale and balanced data. However, data in real-world
visual recognition are usually long-tailed, bringing challenges to efficient
training and deployment of DNNs. Information bottleneck (IB) is an elegant
approach for representation learning. In this paper, we propose a balanced
information bottleneck (BIB) approach, in which loss function re-balancing and
self-distillation techniques are integrated into the original IB network. BIB
is thus capable of learning a sufficient representation with essential
label-related information fully preserved for long-tailed visual recognition.
To further enhance the representation learning capability, we also propose a
novel structure of mixture of multiple balanced information bottlenecks (MBIB),
where different BIBs are responsible for combining knowledge from different
network layers. MBIB facilitates an end-to-end learning strategy that trains
representation and classification simultaneously from an information theory
perspective. We conduct experiments on commonly used long-tailed datasets,
including CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018. Both BIB and MBIB
reach state-of-the-art performance for long-tailed visual recognition.

*Yotam Erel,Rishabh Dabral,Vladislav Golyanik,Amit H. Bermano,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PractiLight is a practical approach for controlling lighting in generated images by leveraging foundational generative models. It uses a lightweight LoRA regressor to produce irradiance maps and employs classifier guidance for lighting control, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for light control in generated images require extensive domain-specific datasets, limiting generalization. The authors aim to develop a practical method that leverages foundational knowledge from recent generative models without extensive retraining.

Method: The method identifies that lighting relationships resemble token interactions in self-attention layers. It trains a lightweight LoRA regressor on a small dataset to produce direct irradiance maps, then uses classifier guidance to incorporate desired lighting into image generation.

Result: PractiLight demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in quality and lighting control across diverse scenes and image domains. It shows proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works.

Conclusion: This work shows that image lighting can be effectively controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge of generative models, enabling practical and general relighting without extensive retraining or large datasets.

Abstract: Light control in generated images is a difficult task, posing specific
challenges, spanning over the entire image and frequency spectrum. Most
approaches tackle this problem by training on extensive yet domain-specific
datasets, limiting the inherent generalization and applicability of the
foundational backbones used. Instead, PractiLight is a practical approach,
effectively leveraging foundational understanding of recent generative models
for the task. Our key insight is that lighting relationships in an image are
similar in nature to token interaction in self-attention layers, and hence are
best represented there. Based on this and other analyses regarding the
importance of early diffusion iterations, PractiLight trains a lightweight LoRA
regressor to produce the direct irradiance map for a given image, using a small
set of training images. We then employ this regressor to incorporate the
desired lighting into the generation process of another image using Classifier
Guidance. This careful design generalizes well to diverse conditions and image
domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of quality and
control with proven parameter and data efficiency compared to leading works
over a wide variety of scenes types. We hope this work affirms that image
lighting can feasibly be controlled by tapping into foundational knowledge,
enabling practical and general relighting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGDiST is a reference-free latent gene diffusion model that addresses data dropout in spatial transcriptomics by using context genes to build a biologically meaningful latent space, achieving 18% lower MSE than previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models for predicting spatially resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from data dropout limitations, dependency on single-cell RNA sequencing references, alignment quality issues, batch effects, and inherited dropout problems.

Method: LGDiST uses a reference-free latent gene diffusion approach that leverages context genes previously considered uninformative to construct a rich genetic latent space, incorporating neighbor conditioning and ST latent space components.

Result: LGDiST outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 18% lower average MSE across 26 datasets and improves gene expression prediction performance by up to 10% on six existing methods. Ablation studies show key components (context genes, ST latent space, neighbor conditioning) are essential for optimal performance.

Conclusion: LGDiST represents a significant advancement in spatial transcriptomics analysis by providing a reference-free approach that effectively addresses data dropout while building biologically meaningful representations, with its full architecture substantially outperforming any isolated components.

Abstract: Computer Vision has proven to be a powerful tool for analyzing Spatial
Transcriptomics (ST) data. However, current models that predict spatially
resolved gene expression from histopathology images suffer from significant
limitations due to data dropout. Most existing approaches rely on single-cell
RNA sequencing references, making them dependent on alignment quality and
external datasets while also risking batch effects and inherited dropout. In
this paper, we address these limitations by introducing LGDiST, the first
reference-free latent gene diffusion model for ST data dropout. We show that
LGDiST outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in gene expression completion,
with an average Mean Squared Error that is 18% lower across 26 datasets.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that completing ST data with LGDiST improves gene
expression prediction performance on six state-of-the-art methods up to 10% in
MSE. A key innovation of LGDiST is using context genes previously considered
uninformative to build a rich and biologically meaningful genetic latent space.
Our experiments show that removing key components of LGDiST, such as the
context genes, the ST latent space, and the neighbor conditioning, leads to
considerable drops in performance. These findings underscore that the full
architecture of LGDiST achieves substantially better performance than any of
its isolated components.

TL;DR: This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of federated learning for object detection in connected autonomous vehicles, analyzing performance, resource usage, and environmental robustness across multiple state-of-the-art detectors and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized training for object detection in CAVs lacks scalability, adaptability, and privacy preservation. Federated learning offers collaborative and privacy-preserving training but faces challenges in computational demands, heterogeneity, and environmental variability that need systematic evaluation for practical deployment.

Method: The study conducts holistic deployment-oriented evaluation using YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR detectors on KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes datasets. It analyzes trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost, and resource usage under diverse conditions including different resolutions, batch sizes, weather/lighting conditions, and dynamic client participation.

Result: The evaluation provides comprehensive insights into the performance-resource trade-offs of FL-based object detection systems in CAVs, though specific quantitative results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: This work paves the way for robust FL deployment in CAVs by establishing a framework for evaluating the critical factors of heterogeneity, computational constraints, and environmental variability that affect real-world implementation.

Abstract: Object detection is crucial for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to
perceive their surroundings and make safe driving decisions. Centralized
training of object detection models often achieves promising accuracy, fast
convergence, and simplified training process, but it falls short in
scalability, adaptability, and privacy-preservation. Federated learning (FL),
by contrast, enables collaborative, privacy-preserving, and continuous training
across naturally distributed CAV fleets. However, deploying FL in real-world
CAVs remains challenging due to the substantial computational demands of
training and inference, coupled with highly diverse operating conditions.
Practical deployment must address three critical factors: (i) heterogeneity
from non-IID data distributions, (ii) constrained onboard computing hardware,
and (iii) environmental variability such as lighting and weather, alongside
systematic evaluation to ensure reliable performance. This work introduces the
first holistic deployment-oriented evaluation of FL-based object detection in
CAVs, integrating model performance, system-level resource profiling, and
environmental robustness. Using state-of-the-art detectors, YOLOv5, YOLOv8,
YOLOv11, and Deformable DETR, evaluated on the KITTI, BDD100K, and nuScenes
datasets, we analyze trade-offs between detection accuracy, computational cost,
and resource usage under diverse resolutions, batch sizes, weather and lighting
conditions, and dynamic client participation, paving the way for robust FL
deployment in CAVs.

Motivation: Direct training of deep learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to high dimensionality and scarce labeled datasets. Traditional methods like SfM and SLAM struggle with unstructured environments and detailed geometric representations for downstream tasks.

Method: Integration of geometric priors and constraints (depth information, surface normals, equivariance) into deep learning models to enhance accuracy and robustness of geometric representations.

Result: Developed geometric deep learning methods tailored for camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth prediction, and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating effectiveness in real-world applications.

Conclusion: The integration of geometric constraints with deep learning provides robust geometry-aware models that address fundamental challenges in 3D vision and enable applications in digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping
technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development.
Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep
learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality
inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion

performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle
with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often
struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for
downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations
require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional
geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust
geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D
vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential
tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral/hyperspectral remote sensing for water quality monitoring using widely available RGB imagery.

Method: Developed a scene classification framework using transfer learning with five state-of-the-art CNN architectures (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and Vision Transformer, trained on 500,000+ seasonally varied USGS images.

Result: DenseNet121 achieved the highest validation performance with R2 score of 0.89 for predicting CDOM, demonstrating strong potential for real-world water quality monitoring.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for environmental monitoring but requires future improvements for low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand operational utility.

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition
and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental
monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water
quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and
public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep
learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active
water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored
Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and
Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water.
HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens
monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors,
industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more
than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States
Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System
between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as
a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and
hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural
networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer
are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing
architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an
R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for
real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the
current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on
improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its
operational utility.

TL;DR: Zero-shot framework using pre-trained vision language models for wildfire damage assessment from ground-level imagery, showing dramatic improvement with multi-view analysis compared to single-view approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Escalating wildfire intensity demands rapid property damage assessment methods that don't require extensive labeled datasets or time-consuming traditional approaches.

Method: Two pipelines: VLM-only (Pipeline A) and VLM+LLM (Pipeline B) using structured prompts based on wildfire damage indicators, applied to 2025 Eaton and Palisades fires in California.

Result: Multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores 0.857-0.947) vs single-view (0.225-0.511). McNemar test confirmed statistical significance for multi-view improvements, but no significant difference between Pipeline A and B.

Conclusion: Immediately deployable, flexible workflow that bypasses supervised training needs, accelerating disaster response triage. Future research should explore LLM prompting potential.

Abstract: The escalating intensity and frequency of wildfires demand innovative
computational methods for rapid and accurate property damage assessment.
Traditional methods are often time consuming, while modern computer vision
approaches typically require extensive labeled datasets, hindering immediate
post-disaster deployment. This research introduces a novel, zero-shot framework
leveraging pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to classify damage from
ground-level imagery. We propose and evaluate two pipelines applied to the 2025
Eaton and Palisades fires in California, a VLM (Pipeline A) and a VLM + large
language model (LLM) approach (Pipeline B), that integrate structured prompts
based on specific wildfire damage indicators. A primary scientific contribution
of this study is demonstrating the VLMs efficacy in synthesizing information
from multiple perspectives to identify nuanced damage, a critical limitation in
existing literature. Our findings reveal that while single view assessments
struggled to classify affected structures (F1 scores ranging from 0.225 to
0.511), the multi-view analysis yielded dramatic improvements (F1 scores
ranging from 0.857 to 0.947). Moreover, the McNemar test confirmed that
pipelines with a multi-view image assessment yields statistically significant
classification improvements; however, the improvements this research observed
between Pipeline A and B were not statistically significant. Thus, future
research can explore the potential of LLM prompting in damage assessment. The
practical contribution is an immediately deployable, flexible, and
interpretable workflow that bypasses the need for supervised training,
significantly accelerating triage and prioritization for disaster response
practitioners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale diffusion models for super-resolution suffer from severe overfitting when trained on few-shot drone-captured infrared data, undermining their generalization ability.

Method: Gaussian quantization representation learning method for diffusion models with an overfitting monitoring mechanism during training, tested on a new multi-source drone infrared benchmark dataset.

Result: Method outperforms existing super-resolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large-scale architectures under complex few-sample conditions.

Conclusion: The proposed Gaussian quantization representation learning effectively addresses overfitting in large-scale diffusion models while maintaining architecture complexity, demonstrating strong performance on drone infrared image reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Although large scale models achieve significant improvements in performance,
the overfitting challenge still frequently undermines their generalization
ability. In super resolution tasks on images, diffusion models as
representatives of generative models typically adopt large scale architectures.
However, few-shot drone-captured infrared training data frequently induces
severe overfitting in large-scale architectures. To address this key challenge,
our method proposes a new Gaussian quantization representation learning method
oriented to diffusion models that alleviates overfitting and enhances
robustness. At the same time, an effective monitoring mechanism tracks large
scale architectures during training to detect signs of overfitting. By
introducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method
effectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On
this basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark
dataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale
architectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image
reconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating
overfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geo-localization models like GeoCLIP lack interpretability, and existing concept-based methods don't align well with geo-alignment objectives, leading to suboptimal performance and interpretability.

Method: Proposes a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes concept-level loss to enhance alignment in concept-specific subspaces.

Result: The approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks while providing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making.

Conclusion: This is the first work to introduce interpretability into geo-localization, demonstrating that concept-aware alignment improves both accuracy and interpretability for global geographic image localization.

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location
of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as
climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in
geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location
alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the
interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current
concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with
Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal
interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel
framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our
method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and
location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical
climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing
alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into
geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses
GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse
geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic
decision-making processes.

TL;DR: A novel training paradigm using hard samples and specialized contrastive losses to improve CLIP's understanding of diagrammatic images like flowcharts, outperforming standard CLIP and hard negative CLIP approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard multimodal models like CLIP struggle with specialized visual domains such as diagrams, which contain structured, symbolic information different from natural imagery.

Method: Proposed contrastive learning approach with two specialized loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams, using hard samples for training.

Result: Substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning on flowchart benchmark for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks.

Conclusion: Tailored training strategies are crucial for specialized tasks, and this approach advances diagrammatic understanding in vision-language integration.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic
representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to
specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic
information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to
enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models.
Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that
incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent
structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model
training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and
semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as
a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial
improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning
paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our
findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for
specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within
the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

*Hongyu Li,Chaofeng Chen,Xiaoming Li,Guangming Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First image inpainting framework using 2D Gaussian Splatting, combining continuous rendering for pixel coherence with DINO features for global semantic consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore Gaussian Splatting's untapped potential for image inpainting, which requires both local pixel coherence and global semantic restoration that current methods struggle with.

Method: Encodes incomplete images into continuous 2D Gaussian splat coefficients, uses differentiable rasterization with patch-wise strategy for efficiency, and incorporates pretrained DINO features for semantic guidance.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, demonstrating effective pixel coherence and semantic consistency.

Conclusion: Establishes a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing, showing promising results for image inpainting with inherent pixel-level coherence benefits.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points
into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D
scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its
untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent
pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the
first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes
incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and
reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The
continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence
in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a
patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates
inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a
pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally
robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide
semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content
remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality,
establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image
processing.

*Therese Joseph,Tobias Fischer,Michael Milford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event camera ensemble VPR method combining multiple reconstructions, feature extractors, and temporal resolutions achieves 57% recall improvement in day-night transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer high dynamic range and low latency but robust visual place recognition under severe illumination changes remains challenging.

Method: Ensemble-based approach combining sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions, VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions with broader fusion strategy.

Result: 57% relative improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions on long-term driving datasets (8km per traverse) without metric subsampling.

Conclusion: The proposed ensemble fusion strategy significantly enhances robustness to lighting variations, and comprehensive analysis identifies critical components for performance.

Abstract: Compared to conventional cameras, event cameras provide a high dynamic range
and low latency, offering greater robustness to rapid motion and challenging
lighting conditions. Although the potential of event cameras for visual place
recognition (VPR) has been established, developing robust VPR frameworks under
severe illumination changes remains an open research problem. In this paper, we
introduce an ensemble-based approach to event camera place recognition that
combines sequence-matched results from multiple event-to-frame reconstructions,
VPR feature extractors, and temporal resolutions. Unlike previous event-based
ensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion
strategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting
conditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative
improvement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach
on two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric
subsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration
that influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key
design choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction
methods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for
robust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard
sequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence
lengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and
benchmarking framework.

*Dong She,Siming Fu,Mushui Liu,Qiaoqiao Jin,Hualiang Wang,Mu Liu,Jidong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a new framework for multi-subject image generation that uses semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement to maintain identity fidelity and prevent attribute leakage when generating images from multiple reference subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-subject generation methods suffer from identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces, especially when handling more than 3 reference subjects.

Method: The framework introduces SemAlign-MS dataset with fine-grained semantic correspondences, semantic correspondence attention loss for precise point-to-point alignment, and multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal attention subspaces.

Result: MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and maintains high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, outperforming existing methods that typically degrade beyond 3 subjects.

Conclusion: MOSAIC opens new possibilities for complex multi-subject synthesis applications by successfully addressing the challenges of identity fidelity and semantic coherence through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature disentanglement.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized generation presents unique challenges in
maintaining identity fidelity and semantic coherence when synthesizing images
conditioned on multiple reference subjects. Existing methods often suffer from
identity blending and attribute leakage due to inadequate modeling of how
different subjects should interact within shared representation spaces. We
present MOSAIC, a representation-centric framework that rethinks multi-subject
generation through explicit semantic correspondence and orthogonal feature
disentanglement. Our key insight is that multi-subject generation requires
precise semantic alignment at the representation level - knowing exactly which
regions in the generated image should attend to which parts of each reference.
To enable this, we introduce SemAlign-MS, a meticulously annotated dataset
providing fine-grained semantic correspondences between multiple reference
subjects and target images, previously unavailable in this domain. Building on
this foundation, we propose the semantic correspondence attention loss to
enforce precise point-to-point semantic alignment, ensuring high consistency
from each reference to its designated regions. Furthermore, we develop the
multi-reference disentanglement loss to push different subjects into orthogonal
attention subspaces, preventing feature interference while preserving
individual identity characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MOSAIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. Notably,
while existing methods typically degrade beyond 3 subjects, MOSAIC maintains
high fidelity with 4+ reference subjects, opening new possibilities for complex
multi-subject synthesis applications.

*Quan Dao,Xiaoxiao He,Ligong Han,Ngan Hoai Nguyen,Amin Heyrani Nobar,Faez Ahmed,Han Zhang,Viet Anh Nguyen,Dimitris Metaxas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VARIN is a novel noise inversion-based editing method for Visual AutoRegressive models that enables precise text-guided image editing without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable prompt-guided image editing capabilities in Visual AutoRegressive models without requiring additional training, supporting practical real-world applications.

Method: Introduces Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN) with Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI) to generate inverse Gumbel noises for precise image reconstruction and targeted editing.

Result: Extensive experiments show VARIN effectively modifies source images according to text prompts while preserving original background and structural details.

Conclusion: VARIN validates the efficacy of noise inversion-based editing for VAR models as a practical approach for text-to-image editing tasks.

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models (VAR) have recently emerged as a promising class
of generative models, achieving performance comparable to diffusion models in
text-to-image generation tasks. While conditional generation has been widely
explored, the ability to perform prompt-guided image editing without additional
training is equally critical, as it supports numerous practical real-world
applications. This paper investigates the text-to-image editing capabilities of
VAR by introducing Visual AutoRegressive Inverse Noise (VARIN), the first noise
inversion-based editing technique designed explicitly for VAR models. VARIN
leverages a novel pseudo-inverse function for argmax sampling, named
Location-aware Argmax Inversion (LAI), to generate inverse Gumbel noises. These
inverse noises enable precise reconstruction of the source image and facilitate
targeted, controllable edits aligned with textual prompts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VARIN effectively modifies source images according
to specified prompts while significantly preserving the original background and
structural details, thus validating its efficacy as a practical editing
approach.

### [310] [Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought Imagination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01986)
*Ziyun Zeng,Junhao Zhang,Wei Li,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Draw-In-Mind (DIM) addresses imbalanced responsibilities in unified multimodal models by creating a dataset that enhances instruction comprehension and provides explicit design blueprints for image editing, achieving SOTA performance with a modest 4.6B parameter model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified multimodal models struggle with precise image editing due to an imbalanced division of responsibilities where the understanding module acts only as a translator while the generation module must handle both design and painting tasks, despite the understanding module having more training data for complex reasoning.

Method: Introduces DIM dataset with two subsets: DIM-T2I (14M long-context image-text pairs) for enhanced instruction comprehension, and DIM-Edit (233K chain-of-thought imaginations from GPT-4o) as explicit design blueprints. Connects frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via lightweight MLP, trained on DIM dataset.

Result: DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models like UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit despite its modest parameter scale.

Conclusion: Explicitly assigning design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing tasks, demonstrating that better task division rather than simply scaling model size is key to improving multimodal editing performance.

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a
single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach
achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles
with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced
division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a
translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the
generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring
the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the
new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding
module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning
tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce
Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)
DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex
instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K
chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design
blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable
SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM
dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale,
DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and
GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1
and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the
design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits
for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at

### [312] [Palette Aligned Image Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02000)
*Elad Aharoni,Noy Porat,Dani Lischinski,Ariel Shamir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Palette-Adapter is a new method that enables text-to-image diffusion models to generate images adhering to user-specified color palettes while maintaining semantic coherence and image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color palettes are widely used in creative workflows but introduce ambiguity and instability when conditioning image generation, requiring a solution that provides flexible control over palette adherence.

Method: The approach interprets palettes as sparse histograms with two control parameters (entropy and distance), introduces negative histograms to suppress unwanted hues, and trains on a carefully curated dataset with balanced color coverage.

Result: The method consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette adherence and high image quality, as validated through qualitative, quantitative, and user study evaluations.

Conclusion: Palette-Adapter provides stable and semantically coherent image generation across diverse palettes and prompts, effectively addressing the challenges of palette-based conditioning in diffusion models.

Abstract: We introduce the Palette-Adapter, a novel method for conditioning
text-to-image diffusion models on a user-specified color palette. While
palettes are a compact and intuitive tool widely used in creative workflows,
they introduce significant ambiguity and instability when used for conditioning
image generation. Our approach addresses this challenge by interpreting
palettes as sparse histograms and introducing two scalar control parameters:
histogram entropy and palette-to-histogram distance, which allow flexible
control over the degree of palette adherence and color variation. We further
introduce a negative histogram mechanism that allows users to suppress specific
undesired hues, improving adherence to the intended palette under the standard
classifier-free guidance mechanism. To ensure broad generalization across the
color space, we train on a carefully curated dataset with balanced coverage of
rare and common colors. Our method enables stable, semantically coherent
generation across a wide range of palettes and prompts. We evaluate our method
qualitatively, quantitatively, and through a user study, and show that it
consistently outperforms existing approaches in achieving both strong palette
adherence and high image quality.

*Stanley Mugisha,Rashid Kisitu,Francis Komakech,Excellence Favor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight vision-based system using quantized MobileNet on Raspberry Pi achieves high accuracy (91.8% sleep detection, 97.7% crying detection) for non-invasive neonatal monitoring in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preterm birth is a major cause of neonatal mortality, especially in low-resource settings where continuous monitoring is challenging with manual methods or invasive sensors that are error-prone and impractical.

Method: Embedded monitoring system using quantized MobileNet model deployed on Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection, with model quantization for memory efficiency and IoT communication for clinical alerts.

Result: State-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection, 97.7% for crying/normal classification) with 68% reduction in model size, demonstrating computational efficiency suitable for edge deployment while larger models proved too resource-intensive.

Conclusion: Lightweight optimized models like MobileNet provide the most viable foundation for scalable, low-cost NICU monitoring systems in resource-constrained environments, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Preterm birth remains a leading cause of neonatal mortality,
disproportionately affecting low-resource settings with limited access to
advanced neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).Continuous monitoring of infant
behavior, such as sleep/awake states and crying episodes, is critical but
relies on manual observation or invasive sensors, which are prone to error,
impractical, and can cause skin damage. This paper presents a novel,
noninvasive, and automated vision-based framework to address this gap. We
introduce an embedded monitoring system that utilizes a quantized MobileNet
model deployed on a Raspberry Pi for real-time behavioral state detection. When
trained and evaluated on public neonatal image datasets, our system achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy (91.8% for sleep detection and 97.7% for
crying/normal classification) while maintaining computational efficiency
suitable for edge deployment. Through comparative benchmarking, we provide a
critical analysis of the trade-offs between model size, inference latency, and
diagnostic accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that while larger architectures
(e.g., ResNet152, VGG19) offer marginal gains in accuracy, their computational
cost is prohibitive for real-time edge use. The proposed framework integrates
three key innovations: model quantization for memory-efficient inference (68%
reduction in size), Raspberry Pi-optimized vision pipelines, and secure IoT
communication for clinical alerts. This work conclusively shows that
lightweight, optimized models such as the MobileNet offer the most viable
foundation for scalable, low-cost, and clinically actionable NICU monitoring
systems, paving the way for improved preterm care in resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: Simple yet effective technique of using synthetic hard negatives significantly enhances vision transformer representation learning capabilities.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a novel method per se. Instead, we address the
neglected potential of hard negative samples in self-supervised learning.
Previous works explored synthetic hard negatives but rarely in the context of

negatives to improve vision transformer representation learning. This simple

representations. Our experiments show performance improvements for both DeiT-S

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VEIL adversarial framework exposes vulnerabilities in Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) systems, compromising both linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching through persistent spatial-temporal reasoning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite advances in language-vision understanding and RMOT systems, their reliability and robustness remain underexplored from a security perspective, particularly regarding adversarial vulnerabilities.

Method: VEIL adversarial framework targets RMOT systems by crafting digital and physical perturbations that disrupt unified referring-matching mechanisms and exploit FIFO-based memory vulnerabilities to introduce persistent errors.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations on Refer-KITTI dataset show VEIL effectively corrupts tracking logic reliability, causing track ID switches and terminations in RMOT systems.

Conclusion: The research demonstrates critical security vulnerabilities in RMOT systems and highlights the urgent need for security-aware designs in large-scale applications.

Abstract: Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced
perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring
Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT
systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic
description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning
modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction,
temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling
long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations.
Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain
underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT
systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial
vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and
track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel
vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby
targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce
errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames.
We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified
referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted
digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability,
inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive
evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL
and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical
large-scale applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of contrastive self-supervised learning that requires vast real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives, by exploring synthetic alternatives.

Method: Investigates two approaches: 1) using generative models to create synthetic data for sample diversity augmentation, and 2) generating synthetic hard negatives in representation space. Combines both in Syn2Co framework and evaluates on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures.

Result: The study highlights both the promise and limitations of using synthetic data in self-supervised learning, providing insights into synthetic-enhanced training for visual representations.

Conclusion: Synthetic data approaches show potential for creating more robust and transferable visual representations, but also have limitations that need to be addressed in future work.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on
existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration
from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised
learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts
of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore
alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in
vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for
unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment
sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic
hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging
contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and
evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and
transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our
findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in
self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

TL;DR: RocketScience is a new benchmark that tests VLMs' spatial relation understanding using real-world image-text pairs, showing current VLMs struggle significantly with spatial reasoning while humans perform well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of spatial relation understanding in current vision-language models (VLMs) and create a benchmark that specifically tests this capability in real-world scenarios.

Method: Created a new benchmark with real-world image-text pairs focusing on spatial relations and object order. Tested various VLMs including open-source and commercial models, and performed disentanglement analysis to separate object localization from spatial reasoning capabilities.

Result: Current VLMs show striking lack of spatial relation understanding, performing poorly compared to humans. Reasoning models surprisingly performed better. Analysis revealed performance is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning rather than object localization.

Conclusion: Spatial reasoning remains a significant challenge for VLMs, and the RocketScience benchmark effectively exposes this weakness while providing a valuable tool for future model development and evaluation.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests
for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world
image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order
of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and
this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial
relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a
surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a
disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization
and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the
performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not
object localization capabilities.

*Pinzhuo Tian,Shengjie Yang,Hang Yu,Alex C. Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ContextFusion and Bootstrap Branch to enhance slot attention models by incorporating semantic information and enabling flexible feature adaptation, addressing limitations in existing object-centric learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slot attention methods lack high-level semantic information and cannot fine-tune encoders due to stability requirements, limiting their understanding of object characteristics and flexibility.

Method: Introduces ContextFusion stage to exploit semantic information from foreground/background with auxiliary indicators, and Bootstrap Branch to decouple feature adaptation from reconstruction using bootstrap strategy.

Result: Significantly improves performance of different state-of-the-art slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed enhancements successfully address key limitations in slot attention methods, enabling better semantic understanding and more flexible feature adaptation for improved object-centric learning.

Abstract: A key human ability is to decompose a scene into distinct objects and use
their relationships to understand the environment. Object-centric learning aims
to mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot
attention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and
has been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot
attention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic
information. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on
low-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly
sensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object
contours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to
fine-tune the encoder. Current methods require a stable feature space
throughout training to enable reconstruction from slots, which restricts the
flexibility needed for effective object-centric learning. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel ContextFusion stage and a Bootstrap Branch,
both of which can be seamlessly integrated into existing slot attention models.
In the ContextFusion stage, we exploit semantic information from the foreground
and background, incorporating an auxiliary indicator that provides additional
contextual cues about them to enrich the semantic content beyond low-level
features. In the Bootstrap Branch, we decouple feature adaptation from the
original reconstruction phase and introduce a bootstrap strategy to train a
feature-adaptive mechanism, allowing for more flexible adaptation. Experimental
results show that our method significantly improves the performance of
different SOTA slot attention models on both simulated and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is a challenging task as models are
required to generalize across numerous attributes in real-world data.
Traditional approaches focus on complex methods, yet recognition performance is
often constrained by training dataset limitations, particularly the
under-representation of certain attributes. In this paper, we propose a
data-centric approach to improve PAR by synthetic data augmentation guided by
textual descriptions. First, we define a protocol to identify weakly recognized
attributes across multiple datasets. Second, we propose a prompt-driven
pipeline that leverages diffusion models to generate synthetic pedestrian
images while preserving the consistency of PAR datasets. Finally, we derive a
strategy to seamlessly incorporate synthetic samples into training data, which
considers prompt-based annotation rules and modifies the loss function. Results
on popular PAR datasets demonstrate that our approach not only boosts
recognition of underrepresented attributes but also improves overall model
performance beyond the targeted attributes. Notably, this approach strengthens
zero-shot generalization without requiring architectural changes of the model,
presenting an efficient and scalable solution to improve the recognition of
attributes of pedestrians in the real world.

*Matic Fučka,Vitjan Zavrtanik,Danijel Skočaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD is a semantics-aware discriminative method that significantly improves logical anomaly detection by explicitly modeling object composition maps, achieving 96.1% AUROC on MVTec LOCO benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current surface anomaly detection methods perform well on structural anomalies but struggle with logical anomalies (irregular/missing components). Existing approaches discard spatial and semantic information through aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Proposes SALAD with a novel composition branch to explicitly model object composition map distributions and learn semantic relationships. Introduces a new procedure for extracting composition maps without hand-made labels or category-specific information.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on MVTec LOCO benchmark, achieving 96.1% image-level AUROC.

Conclusion: SALAD effectively addresses logical anomaly detection by modeling composition map distributions and preserving semantic information, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural
anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies,
such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical
anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or
handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which
discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We
propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection
method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly
model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning
important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure
for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or
category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively
modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon
state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly
detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

*Benjamin Missaoui,Orcun Cetintas,Guillem Brasó,Tim Meinhardt,Laura Leal-Taixé*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NOOUGAT is a unified multi-object tracker that bridges online/offline MOT with flexible temporal processing using GNNs and autoregressive layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MOT methods are fragmented into online (frame-by-frame) and offline (batch processing) approaches, neither handling flexible temporal requirements or long-term occlusions well.

Method: Uses unified Graph Neural Network framework with non-overlapping subclips and novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer, where subclip size controls latency vs context trade-off.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: improves online AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in offline mode.

Conclusion: NOOUGAT successfully unifies online and offline tracking with flexible temporal horizons, outperforming specialized approaches in both regimes.

Abstract: The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline}
Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to
address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios.
Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted
association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas
\textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on
heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce
NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal
horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that
processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel
Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the
trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of
deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving
\textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on
MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.

Abstract: Hair artifacts in dermoscopic images present significant challenges for
accurate skin lesion analysis, potentially obscuring critical diagnostic
features in dermatological assessments. This work introduces a fine-tuned
SegFormer model augmented with dropout regularization to achieve precise hair
mask segmentation. The proposed SegformerWithDropout architecture leverages the
MiT-B2 encoder, pretrained on ImageNet, with an in-channel count of 3 and 2
output classes, incorporating a dropout probability of 0.3 in the segmentation
head to prevent overfitting. Training is conducted on a specialized dataset of
500 dermoscopic skin lesion images with fine-grained hair mask annotations,
employing 10-fold cross-validation, AdamW optimization with a learning rate of
0.001, and cross-entropy loss. Early stopping is applied based on validation
loss, with a patience of 3 epochs and a maximum of 20 epochs per fold.
Performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including
Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch
Similarity (LPIPS). Experimental results from the cross-validation demonstrate
robust performance, with average Dice coefficients reaching approximately 0.96
and IoU values of 0.93, alongside favorable PSNR (around 34 dB), SSIM (0.97),
and low LPIPS (0.06), highlighting the model's effectiveness in accurate hair
artifact segmentation and its potential to enhance preprocessing for downstream
skin cancer detection tasks.

Conclusion: Diffusion models are effective for generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR tasks, and careful parameter selection can significantly enhance PAR model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves identifying various human
attributes from images with applications in intelligent monitoring systems. The
scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets hinders the generalization of PAR
models, specially in complex scenarios involving occlusions, varying poses, and
diverse environments. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown promise
for generating diverse and realistic synthetic images, allowing to expand the
size and variability of training data. However, the potential of
diffusion-based data expansion for generating PAR-like images remains
underexplored. Such expansion may enhance the robustness and adaptability of
PAR models in real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the effectiveness
of diffusion models in generating synthetic pedestrian images tailored to PAR
tasks. We identify key parameters of img2img diffusion-based data expansion;
including text prompts, image properties, and the latest enhancements in
diffusion-based data augmentation, and examine their impact on the quality of
generated images for PAR. Furthermore, we employ the best-performing expansion
approach to generate synthetic images for training PAR models, by enriching the
zero-shot datasets. Experimental results show that prompt alignment and image
properties are critical factors in image generation, with optimal selection
leading to a 4.5% improvement in PAR recognition performance.

TL;DR: CFpano is the first benchmark dataset for cross-frame correlated panoramas visual question answering, featuring 2700+ images and 8000+ QA pairs. The authors also propose a novel MLLM with GRPO that achieves state-of-the-art performance (+5.37% overall improvement).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Omnidirectional scene understanding is crucial for applications like embodied AI and autonomous driving, but existing methods only handle single frames, neglecting cross-frame correlated panoramas which are essential for holistic 360° scene understanding.

Method: Created CFpano benchmark dataset with cross-frame correlated panoramas. Developed a multi-modal large language model fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and tailored reward functions for robust reasoning with correlated panoramas.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines by +5.37% in overall performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA tasks. Experimental results validate GRPO effectiveness.

Conclusion: CFpano establishes a new benchmark for panoramic scene understanding, and the proposed MLLM with GRPO demonstrates superior performance in cross-frame correlated panorama reasoning, advancing omnidirectional scene understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Omnidirectional scene understanding is vital for various downstream
applications, such as embodied AI, autonomous driving, and immersive
environments, yet remains challenging due to geometric distortion and complex
spatial relations in 360{\deg} imagery. Existing omnidirectional methods
achieve scene understanding within a single frame while neglecting cross-frame
correlated panoramas. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{CFpano}, the
\textbf{first} benchmark dataset dedicated to cross-frame correlated panoramas
visual question answering in the holistic 360{\deg} scenes. CFpano consists of
over 2700 images together with over 8000 question-answer pairs, and the
question types include both multiple choice and open-ended VQA. Building upon
our CFpano, we further present \methodname, a multi-modal large language model
(MLLM) fine-tuned with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a set of
tailored reward functions for robust and consistent reasoning with cross-frame
correlated panoramas. Benchmark experiments with existing MLLMs are conducted
with our CFpano. The experimental results demonstrate that \methodname achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA
tasks, outperforming strong baselines on all major reasoning categories
(\textbf{+5.37\%} in overall performance). Our analyses validate the
effectiveness of GRPO and establish a new benchmark for panoramic scene

*Shyma Alhuwaider,Motasem Alfarra,Juan C. Perez,Merey Ramazanova,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel tracklet-based dataset called ITD is introduced to benchmark test-time adaptation methods, addressing temporal dependencies in real-world scenarios that current benchmarks miss. The dataset reveals limitations of existing TTA methods and proposes an adversarial memory initialization strategy that significantly improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA benchmarks fail to represent realistic scenarios with temporal dependencies, such as consecutive video frames showing the same object over time. Real-world applications like hand-held cameras and self-driving cars naturally exhibit these temporal patterns that need to be addressed.

Method: Created ITD dataset using tracklets (sequences of object-centric images) from object-tracking dataset bounding boxes. Conducted experimental analysis of current TTA methods and proposed adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA approaches.

Result: The ITD dataset successfully captures temporal dependencies and reveals limitations of existing TTA methods. The proposed adversarial memory initialization strategy substantially boosts performance of various methods on the challenging benchmark.

Conclusion: The ITD dataset provides a more realistic benchmark for TTA methods by incorporating temporal dependencies. The adversarial memory initialization strategy effectively addresses the challenges posed by temporal patterns, significantly improving method performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time
adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate
challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by
hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus
on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the
customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in
machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic
scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive
frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address
this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call
the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in
ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from
tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes
of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental
analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these
methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we
build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization
strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy
substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DSGC-Net is a dual-stream graph convolutional network that addresses crowd counting challenges by modeling density and representation correlations through two semantic graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd counting models struggle with significant density distribution differences between regions and inconsistency in individual representations caused by viewpoint changes and body posture variations, which limit counting accuracy in complex crowd scenarios.

Method: Proposes DSGC-Net with Density Approximation (DA) branch and Representation Approximation (RA) branch. DA branch generates density distribution maps and constructs density-driven semantic graphs based on density similarity. RA branch builds representation-driven semantic graphs using global representation similarity. Both use graph convolutional networks to model latent semantic relationships.

Result: Achieves MAE of 48.9 on ShanghaiTech Part A and 5.9 on ShanghaiTech Part B datasets, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate superior performance.

Conclusion: DSGC-Net effectively enhances model adaptation to density variations and improves counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios through dual-stream graph convolutional networks that capture feature correlations in both density and representation distributions.

Abstract: Deep learning-based crowd counting methods have achieved remarkable progress
in recent years. However, in complex crowd scenarios, existing models still
face challenges when adapting to significant density distribution differences
between regions. Additionally, the inconsistency of individual representations
caused by viewpoint changes and body posture differences further limits the
counting accuracy of the models. To address these challenges, we propose
DSGC-Net, a Dual-Stream Graph Convolutional Network based on feature
correlation mining. DSGC-Net introduces a Density Approximation (DA) branch and
a Representation Approximation (RA) branch. By modeling two semantic graphs, it
captures the potential feature correlations in density variations and
representation distributions. The DA branch incorporates a density prediction
module that generates the density distribution map, and constructs a
density-driven semantic graph based on density similarity. The RA branch
establishes a representation-driven semantic graph by computing global
representation similarity. Then, graph convolutional networks are applied to
the two semantic graphs separately to model the latent semantic relationships,
which enhance the model's ability to adapt to density variations and improve
counting accuracy in multi-view and multi-pose scenarios. Extensive experiments
on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DSGC-Net outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve MAE of 48.9 and 5.9 in
ShanghaiTech Part A and Part B datasets, respectively. The released code is

TL;DR: RS-OOD is a novel framework for few-shot out-of-distribution detection in remote sensing that uses vision-language modeling with spatial feature enhancement, dual-prompt alignment, and confidence-guided self-training to handle complex scene structures and data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD detection methods for natural images are poorly suited for remote sensing due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and pronounced distribution shifts, creating a critical need for specialized approaches.

Method: Proposes RS-OOD framework with three innovations: spatial feature enhancement for scene discrimination, dual-prompt alignment for spatial-semantic consistency verification, and confidence-guided self-training loop for pseudo-label mining without manual annotation.

Result: RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates the critical value of spatial-semantic integration for robust few-shot OOD detection in remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote
sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous
patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and
environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for
natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote
sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and
pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel
framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to
enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key
innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a
dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against
fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a
confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to
expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms
existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables
efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical
value of spatial-semantic integration.

Motivation: Unstructured urban environments present challenges for scene understanding due to complex layouts and domain gaps between synthetic and real data. Existing methods rely on single synthetic sources and struggle with generalization to real-world scenarios.

Method: Self-supervised student-teacher architecture with three key components: ClassMix++ algorithm for blending labeled synthetic data while maintaining semantic integrity, Grounded Mask Consistency Loss (GMC) for cross-domain prediction consistency, and Pseudo-Label Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) for domain-invariant feature learning through iterative knowledge distillation.

Result: The model achieves 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) on the real-world Indian Driving Dataset (IDD), outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on single synthetic sources.

Conclusion: SynthGenNet successfully bridges the sim-to-real domain gap, reduces reliance on labeled target data, and demonstrates robust generalization capabilities for complex urban scene understanding tasks through multi-source synthetic data utilization and self-supervised learning techniques.

Abstract: Unstructured urban environments present unique challenges for scene
understanding and generalization due to their complex and diverse layouts. We
introduce SynthGenNet, a self-supervised student-teacher architecture designed
to enable robust test-time domain generalization using synthetic multi-source

labeled data from various synthetic sources while maintaining semantic
integrity, enhancing model adaptability. We further employ Grounded Mask
Consistency Loss (GMC), which leverages source ground truth to improve
cross-domain prediction consistency and feature alignment. The Pseudo-Label
Guided Contrastive Learning (PLGCL) mechanism is integrated into the student
network to facilitate domain-invariant feature learning through iterative
knowledge distillation from the teacher network. This self-supervised strategy
improves prediction accuracy, addresses real-world variability, bridges the
sim-to-real domain gap, and reliance on labeled target data, even in complex
urban areas. Outcomes show our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (relying
on single source) by achieving 50% Mean Intersection-Over-Union (mIoU) value on

TL;DR: Learn-to-Steer framework uses learned objectives from diffusion model's internal representations to improve spatial reasoning in text-to-image generation, achieving dramatic accuracy improvements without handcrafted losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail at basic spatial reasoning tasks that humans find trivial, and existing methods use suboptimal handcrafted losses to fix these failures.

Method: Proposes Learn-to-Steer framework that trains a lightweight classifier to decode spatial relationships from cross-attention maps, then uses it as a learned loss function during inference. Uses dual-inversion strategy to prevent linguistic shortcuts and enforce geometric understanding.

Result: Dramatically improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to 0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Generalizes to multiple relations with significant accuracy improvements.

Conclusion: Learning spatial objectives directly from model's internal representations is more effective than handcrafted losses, enabling better spatial reasoning in text-to-image generation through data-driven optimization.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can generate stunning visuals, yet they often
fail at tasks children find trivial--like placing a dog to the right of a teddy
bear rather than to the left. When combinations get more unusual--a giraffe
above an airplane--these failures become even more pronounced. Existing methods
attempt to fix these spatial reasoning failures through model fine-tuning or
test-time optimization with handcrafted losses that are suboptimal. Rather than
imposing our assumptions about spatial encoding, we propose learning these
objectives directly from the model's internal representations. We introduce
Learn-to-Steer, a novel framework that learns data-driven objectives for
test-time optimization rather than handcrafting them. Our key insight is to
train a lightweight classifier that decodes spatial relationships from the
diffusion model's cross-attention maps, then deploy this classifier as a
learned loss function during inference. Training such classifiers poses a
surprising challenge: they can take shortcuts by detecting linguistic traces
rather than learning true spatial patterns. We solve this with a dual-inversion
strategy that enforces geometric understanding. Our method dramatically
improves spatial accuracy: from 0.20 to 0.61 on FLUX.1-dev and from 0.07 to
0.54 on SD2.1 across standard benchmarks. Moreover, our approach generalizes to
multiple relations and significantly improves accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional AI evaluation methods often overlook human-like characteristics tested through games. This work aims to assess artificial models using board games to uncover deficiencies not captured by conventional benchmarks.

Method: Testing CLIP's color perception and naming capabilities by playing the board game Hues & Cues and comparing its performance with human observers.

Result: CLIP shows general alignment with human color perception but reveals cultural biases and inconsistencies when handling different abstraction levels that are hard to detect with standard testing approaches.

Conclusion: Board games provide a valuable evaluation framework that can expose model deficiencies in ways that traditional benchmarks cannot, highlighting the importance of diverse testing strategies for assessing AI models.

Abstract: Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to
challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left
out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective
of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via
board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming
capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its
alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned
with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases
and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are
hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that
assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain
deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with
the commonly used benchmarks.

Motivation: Current multimodal agents focus on either GUI (2D virtual) or embodied (3D real) environments separately, but complex tasks require interleaved interaction between both types of environments. Mixing training data causes performance degeneration due to data conflicts.

Method: Proposed Layer-heterogeneity Mixture of Experts (MoE) that separates deep-layer parameters to eliminate GUI-embodied data conflicts while sharing shallow-layer parameters to leverage their synergy. Unified action spaces and collected large-scale multimodal training data from various sources.

Result: OmniActor outperforms agents trained only on GUI or embodied data in both GUI and embodied tasks. The unified approach significantly improves performance across different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks.

Conclusion: The cerebrum-cerebellum inspired architecture successfully addresses the data conflict problem in multimodal agents, enabling effective interleaved interaction between GUI and embodied environments for complex task execution.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models are evolving toward multimodal agents
capable of proactively executing tasks. Most agent research focuses on GUI or
embodied scenarios, which correspond to agents interacting with 2D virtual
worlds or 3D real worlds, respectively. However, many complex tasks typically
require agents to interleavely interact with these two types of environment. We
initially mix GUI and embodied data to train, but find the performance
degeneration brought by the data conflict. Further analysis reveals that GUI
and embodied data exhibit synergy and conflict at the shallow and deep layers,
respectively, which resembles the cerebrum-cerebellum mechanism in the human
brain. To this end, we propose a high-performance generalist agent OmniActor,
designed from both structural and data perspectives. First, we propose
Layer-heterogeneity MoE to eliminate the conflict between GUI and embodied data
by separating deep-layer parameters, while leverage their synergy by sharing
shallow-layer parameters. By successfully leveraging the synergy and
eliminating the conflict, OmniActor outperforms agents only trained by GUI or
embodied data in GUI or embodied tasks. Furthermore, we unify the action spaces
of GUI and embodied tasks, and collect large-scale GUI and embodied data from
various sources for training. This significantly improves OmniActor under
different scenarios, especially in GUI tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

### [334] [Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02351)
*Alireza Sedighi Moghaddam,Mohammad Reza Mohammadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ORDAC is a novel method for detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification using adaptive label distribution learning, achieving significant performance improvements on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label noise in ordinal classification tasks (where class boundaries are ambiguous) degrades model performance, but discarding noisy samples wastes data. There's a need for methods that can correct rather than discard noisy labels.

Method: ORDAC (ORDinal Adaptive Correction) uses Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model ordinal label ambiguity. It dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of label distributions for each sample during training to correct noisy labels adaptively.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Adience (age estimation) and Diabetic Retinopathy datasets. On Adience with 40% noise: MAE reduced from 0.86 to 0.62, recall increased from 0.37 to 0.49. Also effective at correcting intrinsic noise in original datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning
models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for
ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is
prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the
performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses
the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image
classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal
Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy
labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution
Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in
ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and
standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than
discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and
make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience)
and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric
Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions
(ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance.
For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean
absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to
0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic
noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive
label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance
the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of
noisy data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D object synthesis method called C33D that composites 3D models with different object categories using adaptive text-image harmony and multi-view diffusion for consistent textures and accurate shapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D generation methods struggle to effectively integrate multiple content sources, resulting in inconsistent textures and inaccurate shapes when compositing 3D models with different object categories.

Method: Renders multi-view images and normal maps from input 3D model, generates novel 2D object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH), refines textures with texture multi-view diffusion, improves shapes with shape multi-view diffusion, and reconstructs complete 3D model.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness, yielding impressive 3D creations like shark(3D)-crocodile(text) composites with structural coherence and visual consistency.

Conclusion: C33D provides a straightforward yet powerful approach for generating novel and structurally coherent 3D models by effectively integrating 3D models with different object categories through multi-view diffusion techniques.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle a new task of 3D object synthesis, where a 3D model
is composited with another object category to create a novel 3D model. However,
most existing text/image/3D-to-3D methods struggle to effectively integrate
multiple content sources, often resulting in inconsistent textures and
inaccurate shapes. To overcome these challenges, we propose a straightforward
yet powerful approach, category+3D-to-3D (C33D), for generating novel and
structurally coherent 3D models. Our method begins by rendering multi-view
images and normal maps from the input 3D model, then generating a novel 2D
object using adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) with the front-view image and a
text description from another object category as inputs. To ensure texture
consistency, we introduce texture multi-view diffusion, which refines the
textures of the remaining multi-view RGB images based on the novel 2D object.
For enhanced shape accuracy, we propose shape multi-view diffusion to improve
the 2D shapes of both the multi-view RGB images and the normal maps, also
conditioned on the novel 2D object. Finally, these outputs are used to
reconstruct a complete and novel 3D model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method, yielding impressive 3D creations, such as
shark(3D)-crocodile(text) in the first row of Fig. 1. A project page is

*Wanyue Zhang,Yibin Huang,Yangbin Xu,JingJing Huang,Helu Zhi,Shuo Ren,Wang Xu,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with spatial understanding despite recent progress. This paper presents systematic analysis from data and architectural perspectives across single-view, multi-view, and video scenarios using the proposed MulSeT benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research lacks comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs' spatial understanding limitations, which is essential for perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied environments.

Method: Proposed MulSeT benchmark with experiments analyzing spatial reasoning capabilities. Examined data scaling effects and architectural components (positional encoding in visual vs language models) across cascaded and native MLLMs.

Result: Performance converges quickly with more training data but upper bound remains low, especially for spatial imagination tasks. Spatial understanding relies more on visual encoder's positional encoding than language model's. Merely expanding data is insufficient.

Conclusion: Current MLLMs have limitations in spatial reasoning. Future improvements require architectural design optimization and reasoning injection, not just data scaling, to enhance spatial understanding capabilities.

Abstract: Spatial understanding is essential for Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to support perception, reasoning, and planning in embodied
environments. Despite recent progress, existing studies reveal that MLLMs still
struggle with spatial understanding. However, existing research lacks a
comprehensive and systematic evaluation of these limitations, often restricted
to isolated scenarios, such as single-view or video. In this work, we present a
systematic analysis of spatial understanding from both data and architectural
perspectives across three representative scenarios: single-view, multi-view,
and video. We propose a benchmark named MulSeT (Multi-view Spatial
Understanding Tasks), and design a series of experiments to analyze the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. From the data perspective, the performance of
spatial understanding converges quickly as the training data increases, and the
upper bound is relatively low, especially for tasks that require spatial
imagination. This indicates that merely expanding training data is insufficient
to achieve satisfactory performance. From the architectural perspective, we
find that spatial understanding relies more heavily on the positional encoding
within the visual encoder than within the language model, in both cascaded and
native MLLMs. Moreover, we explore reasoning injection and envision future
improvements through architectural design to optimize spatial understanding.
These insights shed light on the limitations of current MLLMs and suggest new
directions for improving spatial reasoning capabilities through data scaling
and architectural tuning.

TL;DR: MedDINOv3 adapts DINOv3 foundation model for medical image segmentation by addressing domain gap and architectural limitations, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning models for medical image segmentation lack generalizability across modalities and institutions, and vision foundation models underperform specialized CNNs due to domain gap and architectural limitations.

Method: Designs simple architecture with multi-scale token aggregation, performs domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M dataset (3.87M CT slices) using multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features.

Result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating foundation models can serve as unified backbones for medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: MedDINOv3 successfully bridges the domain gap between natural and medical images, showing the potential of vision foundation models as effective backbones for medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential
for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning
has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking
generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models
(FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and
transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces
two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still
underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large
domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We
introduce \textbf{MedDINOv3}, a simple and effective framework for adapting
DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple
and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform
domain-adaptive pretraining on \textbf{CT-3M}, a curated collection of 3.87M
axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense
features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four
segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation
models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is

Result: Outperforms all existing aggregation-based methods in both inference time and accuracy, even surpassing iterative-based method IGEV-Stereo, while achieving real-time performance.

Conclusion: Breaks the empirical design of using 3D convolutions for 4D cost volume and provides a simple yet strong baseline for decoupled aggregation paradigm in stereo matching.

Abstract: High-performance real-time stereo matching methods invariably rely on 3D
regularization of the cost volume, which is unfriendly to mobile devices. And
2D regularization based methods struggle in ill-posed regions. In this paper,

TL;DR: GSD-Net is a novel network that integrates geometric and structural guidance to improve medical image segmentation robustness against noisy annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation relies on costly expert annotations that inevitably contain noise from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupts feature learning and degrades model performance.

Method: Proposes Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net) with: 1) Geometric Distance-Aware module for dynamic pixel-level weighting, 2) Structure-Guided Label Refinement module using structural priors, and 3) Knowledge Transfer module to enrich supervision and local detail sensitivity.

Result: Achieved significant improvements: 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. Outperformed state-of-the-art methods on six public datasets with both simulated and real-world noisy annotations.

Conclusion: GSD-Net effectively addresses annotation noise in medical image segmentation by leveraging geometric and structural cues, demonstrating robust performance across diverse datasets and noise types, making it suitable for real-world clinical applications with imperfect annotations.

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image
segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly
and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain
noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature
learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,
this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which
integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy
annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically
adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening
supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided
Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a
Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to
local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated
GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of
simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect
real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results
demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy
annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,
8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of

*Yuhao Wang,Lingjuan Miao,Zhiqiang Zhou,Yajun Qiao,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-driven framework for infrared and visible image fusion that combines collaborative distillation with self-learning to create lightweight yet high-performance models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight models by improving knowledge transfer from teacher to student models while enabling self-learning on challenging samples.

Method: Proposes a novel collaborative distillation and self-learning framework driven by reinforcement learning. Uses an RL agent to identify optimal training strategies, generate challenging samples, and dynamically adjust teacher guidance strength based on student performance.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement in student performance and better fusion results compared to existing techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances image fusion quality through intelligent knowledge transfer and adaptive self-learning, achieving superior performance with lightweight models.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion plays a critical role in enhancing scene
perception by combining complementary information from different modalities.
Despite recent advances, achieving high-quality image fusion with lightweight
models remains a significant challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
collaborative distillation and self-learning framework for image fusion driven
by reinforcement learning. Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not
only enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the
teacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform
self-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.
Particularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and
identifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes
both the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which
leads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's
self-learning. Simultaneously, it dynamically adjusts the teacher's guidance
strength based on the student's state to optimize the knowledge transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly improve
student performance and achieve better fusion results compared to existing
techniques.

TL;DR: A real-time virtual makeup try-on framework that separates makeup transfer into extraction and rendering steps, achieving high-fidelity results with temporal consistency and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with disentangling cosmetics from skin tones, causing identity shifts and fairness concerns, while lacking real-time capabilities and temporal consistency needed for practical adoption.

Method: Decouples makeup transfer into transparent makeup mask extraction and graphics-based mask rendering. Uses pseudo-ground-truth data from graphics rendering and k-means clustering, with specialized training objectives including alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses.

Result: Achieves robust makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while preserving temporal smoothness. Outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses key challenges in virtual makeup try-on by enabling real-time, high-fidelity cosmetic transfer with robust temporal consistency and identity preservation.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for real-time virtual makeup try-on that
achieves high-fidelity, identity-preserving cosmetic transfer with robust
temporal consistency. In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to
synthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained
makeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle
to disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify
features, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,
current methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal
consistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we
decouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and
graphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup
rendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our
makeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two
complementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised
k-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and
color fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including
alpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses. Our method achieves robust
makeup transfer across diverse poses, expressions, and skin tones while
preserving temporal smoothness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing baselines in capturing fine details, maintaining
temporal stability, and preserving identity integrity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and temporal scales is challenging, especially for narrow or sediment-rich rivers poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data, which is critical for climate system understanding, ecosystems, agriculture, and disaster resilience.

Method: Developed RiverScope dataset with 1,145 high-resolution images covering 2,577 km² with expert-labeled river/surface water masks. Co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and SWORD. Evaluated deep networks across multiple architectures, pretraining strategies, and training datasets using multispectral PlanetScope channels with learned adaptors.

Result: Achieved median error of 7.2 meters for river width estimation - significantly outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. Established first global high-resolution benchmark for river width estimation.

Conclusion: RiverScope provides a valuable resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting climate adaptation and sustainable water management through improved accuracy in surface water monitoring.

Abstract: Surface water dynamics play a critical role in Earth's climate system,
influencing ecosystems, agriculture, disaster resilience, and sustainable
development. Yet monitoring rivers and surface water at fine spatial and
temporal scales remains challenging -- especially for narrow or sediment-rich
rivers that are poorly captured by low-resolution satellite data. To address
this, we introduce RiverScope, a high-resolution dataset developed through
collaboration between computer science and hydrology experts. RiverScope
comprises 1,145 high-resolution images (covering 2,577 square kilometers) with
expert-labeled river and surface water masks, requiring over 100 hours of
manual annotation. Each image is co-registered with Sentinel-2, SWOT, and the
SWOT River Database (SWORD), enabling the evaluation of cost-accuracy
trade-offs across sensors -- a key consideration for operational water
monitoring. We also establish the first global, high-resolution benchmark for
river width estimation, achieving a median error of 7.2 meters -- significantly
outperforming existing satellite-derived methods. We extensively evaluate deep
networks across multiple architectures (e.g., CNNs and transformers),
pretraining strategies (e.g., supervised and self-supervised), and training
datasets (e.g., ImageNet and satellite imagery). Our best-performing models
combine the benefits of transfer learning with the use of all the multispectral
PlanetScope channels via learned adaptors. RiverScope provides a valuable
resource for fine-scale and multi-sensor hydrological modeling, supporting
climate adaptation and sustainable water management.

TL;DR: Automated video compositing using Diffusion Transformers to inject foreground identity and motion into target videos while preserving background consistency through novel position embeddings and training techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video compositing requires intensive labor and expert collaboration, leading to long production cycles and high costs. The paper aims to automate this process using generative models.

Method: Developed a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline with background preservation branch using masked token injection, DiT fusion block with full self-attention, foreground augmentation, and Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE) for layout fusion. Trained on curated VideoComp dataset of 61K video sets.

Result: The method effectively realizes generative video compositing, outperforming existing solutions in both fidelity and consistency metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed generative video compositing approach successfully automates the traditionally labor-intensive process, enabling adaptive injection of identity and motion information while maintaining video consistency through novel DiT-based architecture and training techniques.

Abstract: Video compositing combines live-action footage to create video production,
serving as a crucial technique in video creation and film production.
Traditional pipelines require intensive labor efforts and expert collaboration,
resulting in lengthy production cycles and high manpower costs. To address this
issue, we automate this process with generative models, called generative video
compositing. This new task strives to adaptively inject identity and motion
information of foreground video to the target video in an interactive manner,
allowing users to customize the size, motion trajectory, and other attributes
of the dynamic elements added in final video. Specifically, we designed a novel
Diffusion Transformer (DiT) pipeline based on its intrinsic properties. To
maintain consistency of the target video before and after editing, we revised a
light-weight DiT-based background preservation branch with masked token
injection. As to inherit dynamic elements from other sources, a DiT fusion
block is proposed using full self-attention, along with a simple yet effective
foreground augmentation for training. Besides, for fusing background and
foreground videos with different layouts based on user control, we developed a
novel position embedding, named Extended Rotary Position Embedding (ERoPE).
Finally, we curated a dataset comprising 61K sets of videos for our new task,
called VideoComp. This data includes complete dynamic elements and high-quality
target videos. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively realizes
generative video compositing, outperforming existing possible solutions in
fidelity and consistency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiencies of previous SDS-based models and large 3D generative models for text-to-avatar generation, which suffer from slow iterative optimization processes.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Distill a decoder to create structured latent space from a large human reconstruction model, 2) Train text-controlled latent diffusion model to generate 3D avatars within this latent space.

Result: TeRA outperforms previous text-to-avatar generative models in both subjective and objective evaluations, providing more efficient and effective avatar generation.

Conclusion: The proposed TeRA framework successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches by enabling faster, higher-quality 3D avatar generation with text-based customization capabilities through structured latent space representation.

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink text-to-avatar generative models by proposing TeRA,
a more efficient and effective framework than the previous SDS-based models and
general large 3D generative models. Our approach employs a two-stage training
strategy for learning a native 3D avatar generative model. Initially, we
distill a decoder to derive a structured latent space from a large human
reconstruction model. Subsequently, a text-controlled latent diffusion model is
trained to generate photorealistic 3D human avatars within this latent space.
TeRA enhances the model performance by eliminating slow iterative optimization
and enables text-based partial customization through a structured 3D human
representation. Experiments have proven our approach's superiority over
previous text-to-avatar generative models in subjective and objective
evaluation.

*Nabil Jabareen,Dongsheng Yuan,Dingming Liu,Foo-Wei Ten,Sören Lukassen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE) to address limitations of existing positional encodings in medical imaging, showing significant performance improvements in anisotropic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing positional encodings (SPEs and IFPEs) are suboptimal for medical imaging due to inability to handle anisotropic nature of high-dimensional medical images and preserve Euclidean distances in higher-dimensional spaces.

Method: Proposed AFPE as a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and domain-specific spatial dependencies. Benchmarked against common PEs on multi-label chest X-ray classification, CT organ classification, and echocardiography ejection fraction regression.

Result: AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art positional encodings in all tested anisotropic settings. Optimal PE depends on the shape of the structure of interest and data anisotropy.

Conclusion: Choosing an anisotropic positional encoding that fits both the data and the shape of interest is crucial for optimal performance in anisotropic medical images and videos.

Abstract: The adoption of Transformer-based architectures in the medical domain is
growing rapidly. In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as
organs, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often
anisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In
this study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),
arguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific
challenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have
proven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean
distances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional
Encodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,
but they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these
limitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),
a generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and
domain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against
commonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ
classification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in
echocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can
significantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on
the shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,
our proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested
anisotropic settings. We conclude that, in anisotropic medical images and
videos, it is of paramount importance to choose an anisotropic PE that fits the
data and the shape of interest.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning approaches for fitness activity recognition rely on computationally intensive 3D models, limiting real-time feasibility in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Integrates pre-trained 2D CNNs (ResNet50, EfficientNet, Vision Transformers) with LSTM network enhanced by spatial attention mechanism to extract spatial features and capture temporal dependencies.

Result: Achieved peak accuracy of 93.34% with ResNet50-based configuration on curated UCF101 dataset subset, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art HAR systems.

Conclusion: Proposed method offers scalable and real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity
recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and
personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification
from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on
computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or
resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and
effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT)
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention.
These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures
temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative
segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset,
achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration.
Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several
state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and
real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader
applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

*Guyue Hu,Siyuan Song,Jingpeng Sun,Zhe Jin,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MDM-MixMFL framework for MRI segmentation in decentralized multi-modal federated learning settings with modality decoupling and memorizing mechanisms to handle client heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing centralized multimodal MRI segmentation methods are inapplicable for decentralized medical scenarios where hospitals have diverse mixed modalities and suffer from extensive client-wise modality and data heterogeneity.

Method: Modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored and modality-shared information, with corresponding encoders undergoing tailored/shared updating. Modality memorizing mechanism stores dynamically refreshed client-shared modality prototypes to compensate for incomplete modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public MRI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method for MRI image segmentation.

Conclusion: The MDM-MixMFL framework successfully addresses mix-modal federated learning challenges in decentralized MRI segmentation through modality decoupling and memorizing mechanisms, enabling stable aggregation of heterogeneous data and modalities.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing
and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image
segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which
is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In
this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI
modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,
suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data
heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI
image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves
multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It
distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and
cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel
modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework
(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality
decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the
modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored
and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,
corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,
respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of
heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the
modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes
dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for
incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality
aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive
experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our methods.

### [348] [Motion-Refined DINOSAUR for Unsupervised Multi-Object Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02545)
*Xinrui Gong,Oliver Hahn,Christoph Reich,Krishnakant Singh,Simone Schaub-Meyer,Daniel Cremers,Stefan Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR-DINOSAUR is a fully unsupervised approach for multi-object discovery that extends the self-supervised DINOSAUR model using motion-refined pseudo labels from optical flow segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results without human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised multi-object discovery approaches still rely on supervision to generate pseudo labels for training object-centric learning models, which limits their true unsupervised nature.

Method: Extends self-supervised DINOSAUR model by generating high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels through motion segmentation of optical flow from video frames without camera motion, then refines slot representations and trains a slot deactivation module for foreground/background assignment.

Result: Achieves strong multi-object discovery results on TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods despite being fully unsupervised.

Conclusion: MR-DINOSAUR demonstrates that a conceptually simple, fully unsupervised approach using motion-refined pseudo labels can achieve superior performance in multi-object discovery without any human supervision.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-object discovery (MOD) aims to detect and localize
distinct object instances in visual scenes without any form of human
supervision. Recent approaches leverage object-centric learning (OCL) and
motion cues from video to identify individual objects. However, these
approaches use supervision to generate pseudo labels to train the OCL model. We
address this limitation with MR-DINOSAUR -- Motion-Refined DINOSAUR -- a
minimalistic unsupervised approach that extends the self-supervised pre-trained
OCL model, DINOSAUR, to the task of unsupervised multi-object discovery. We
generate high-quality unsupervised pseudo labels by retrieving video frames
without camera motion for which we perform motion segmentation of unsupervised
optical flow. We refine DINOSAUR's slot representations using these pseudo
labels and train a slot deactivation module to assign slots to foreground and
background. Despite its conceptual simplicity, MR-DINOSAUR achieves strong
multi-object discovery results on the TRI-PD and KITTI datasets, outperforming
the previous state of the art despite being fully unsupervised.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling 3D vision foundation models to long-sequence image inputs is challenging due to inference-time inefficiency. Analysis revealed token collapse in attention maps of VGGT, suggesting token merging could improve efficiency.

Method: Proposed FastVGGT with training-free token merging mechanism. Developed unique token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks to eliminate redundant computation while preserving reconstruction capacity.

Result: Achieved 4x speedup over VGGT with 1000 input images while mitigating error accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. Validated effectiveness on multiple 3D geometry benchmarks.

Conclusion: Token merging shows strong potential as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision systems, enabling efficient processing of long image sequences without compromising reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Foundation models for 3D vision have recently demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in 3D perception. However, scaling these models to long-sequence
image inputs remains a significant challenge due to inference-time
inefficiency. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of VGGT, a
state-of-the-art feed-forward visual geometry model and identify its primary
bottleneck. Visualization further reveals a token collapse phenomenon in the
attention maps. Motivated by these findings, we explore the potential of token
merging in the feed-forward visual geometry model. Owing to the unique
architectural and task-specific properties of 3D models, directly applying
existing merging techniques proves challenging. To this end, we propose
FastVGGT, which, for the first time, leverages token merging in the 3D domain
through a training-free mechanism for accelerating VGGT. we devise a unique
token partitioning strategy tailored to 3D architectures and tasks, effectively
eliminating redundant computation while preserving VGGT's powerful
reconstruction capacity. Extensive experiments on multiple 3D geometry
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably, with 1000 input
images, FastVGGT achieves a 4x speedup over VGGT while mitigating error
accumulation in long-sequence scenarios. These findings underscore the
potential of token merging as a principled solution for scalable 3D vision
systems. Code is available at: https://mystorm16.github.io/fastvggt/.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent
challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced
spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets
remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and
evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector

Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech.
We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative
data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance
despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective
model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the
combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1
score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging

### [352] [Automatic Pronunciation Error Detection and Correction of the Holy Quran's Learners Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00094)
*Abdullah Abdelfattah,Mahmoud I. Khalil,Hazem Abbas*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A novel automated pipeline for creating high-quality Quranic pronunciation datasets with 850+ hours of annotated audio, featuring a custom Quran Phonetic Script and achieving 0.16% PER with multi-level CTC modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of assessing spoken language and quantifying pronunciation metrics, particularly for Quranic recitation with tajweed rules, is difficult due to scarcity of high-quality annotated data despite the structured nature of Quranic recitation rules.

Method: Developed a 98% automated pipeline including: collection from expert reciters, segmentation using fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT, transcription, verification via Tasmeea algorithm, and a novel ASR-based approach using custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) with two-level encoding (phoneme and sifa levels) and multi-level CTC modeling.

Result: Produced 850+ hours of audio (~300K annotated utterances) and achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset with the multi-level CTC model.

Conclusion: Successfully bridged the data scarcity gap for Quranic pronunciation assessment by creating a comprehensive automated pipeline and novel phonetic encoding system, with all code, data, and models released as open-source to advance research in this domain.

Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation
metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy
Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed)
established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite
this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a
significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated
pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection
of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using
our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript
verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K
annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error
detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed
rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a
two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long
vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We
further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model
which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We
release all code, data, and models as open-source:

Conclusion: The approach successfully substitutes traditional G2P conversion with direct token generation from speech, offering cost-effective and scalable voice synthesis while maintaining natural speech quality.

Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to voice synthesis that can substitute
the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion by using a deep
learning-based model that generates discrete tokens directly from speech.
Utilizing a pre-trained voice SSL model, we train a T5 encoder to produce
pseudo-language labels from mixed-script texts (e.g., containing Kanji and
Kana). This method eliminates the need for manual phonetic transcription,
reducing costs and enhancing scalability, especially for large non-transcribed
audio datasets. Our model matches the performance of conventional G2P-based
text-to-speech systems and is capable of synthesizing speech that retains
natural linguistic and paralinguistic features, such as accents and

*Yuzheng Cai,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Mingxin Li,Pengjun Xie,Weiguo Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ERank is a new pointwise reranker that combines SFT with fine-grained scoring and RL training to achieve both high effectiveness and efficiency, outperforming existing methods on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based rerankers face a trade-off between efficient pointwise methods (lacking scoring discrimination) and effective but inefficient listwise methods (impractical for low latency applications).

Method: Two-stage training: 1) SFT with generative fine-grained integer scoring instead of binary classification, 2) RL refinement with listwise-derived reward to instill global ranking awareness into pointwise architecture.

Result: Superior performance on BRIGHT, FollowIR, TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks. ERank-4B achieves nDCG@10 of 38.7 and 32B variant reaches state-of-the-art 40.2 nDCG@10 on BRIGHT.

Conclusion: ERank successfully resolves the efficiency-effectiveness dilemma in text reranking by combining fine-grained scoring with RL-based global awareness, making it both highly effective and practical for low-latency applications.

Abstract: Text reranking models are a crucial component in modern systems like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, tasked with selecting the most relevant
documents prior to generation. However, current Large Language Models (LLMs)
powered rerankers often face a fundamental trade-off. On one hand, Supervised
Fine-Tuning based pointwise methods that frame relevance as a binary
classification task lack the necessary scoring discrimination, particularly for
those built on reasoning LLMs. On the other hand, approaches designed for
complex reasoning often employ powerful yet inefficient listwise formulations,
rendering them impractical for low latency applications. To resolve this
dilemma, we introduce ERank, a highly effective and efficient pointwise
reranker built from a reasoning LLM that excels across diverse relevance
scenarios. We propose a novel two-stage training pipeline that begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). In this stage, we move beyond binary labels and
train the model generatively to output fine grained integer scores, which
significantly enhances relevance discrimination. The model is then further
refined using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a novel, listwise derived
reward. This technique instills global ranking awareness into the efficient
pointwise architecture. We evaluate the ERank reranker on the BRIGHT, FollowIR,
TREC DL, and BEIR benchmarks, demonstrating superior effectiveness and
robustness compared to existing approaches. On the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT
benchmark, our ERank-4B achieves an nDCG@10 of 38.7, while a larger 32B variant
reaches a state of the art nDCG@10 of 40.2.

Abstract: As global e-commerce platforms continue to expand, companies are entering new
markets where they encounter cold-start challenges due to limited human labels

provide a competitive cold-start performance of relevance matching for emerging
e-commerce markets. Specifically, we present a Cold-Start Relevance Matching

TL;DR: Hybrid approach combining Top2Vec and Node2Vec embeddings improves legal document clustering by integrating semantic topic modeling with structural graph relationships, outperforming text-only or graph-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal documents present unique challenges with domain-specific language and limited labeled data, requiring specialized approaches for effective text classification and clustering.

Method: Combines unsupervised Top2Vec for semantic document embeddings and topic discovery with Node2Vec for capturing structural relationships via bipartite graphs, followed by KMeans clustering of combined embeddings.

Result: The hybrid Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach demonstrates improved clustering quality over text-only or graph-only embeddings and achieves competitive performance against baseline LDA and NMF models.

Conclusion: The pipeline shows potential for exploratory legal data analysis but requires domain-specific adaptations, better hyperparameter tuning, and human validation for practical legal applications.

Abstract: Legal documents pose unique challenges for text classification due to their
domain-specific language and often limited labeled data. This paper proposes a
hybrid approach for classifying legal texts by combining unsupervised topic and
graph embeddings with a supervised model. We employ Top2Vec to learn semantic
document embeddings and automatically discover latent topics, and Node2Vec to
capture structural relationships via a bipartite graph of legal documents. The
embeddings are combined and clustered using KMeans, yielding coherent groupings
of documents. Our computations on a legal document dataset demonstrate that the
combined Top2Vec+Node2Vec approach improves clustering quality over text-only
or graph-only embeddings. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters,
such as the number of clusters and the dimensionality of the embeddings, and
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance against baseline
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
models. Key findings indicate that while the pipeline presents an innovative
approach to unsupervised legal document analysis by combining semantic topic
modeling with graph embedding techniques, its efficacy is contingent upon the
quality of initial topic generation and the representational power of the
chosen embedding models for specialized legal language. Strategic
recommendations include the exploration of domain-specific embeddings, more
comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for Node2Vec, dynamic determination of
cluster numbers, and robust human-in-the-loop validation processes to enhance
legal relevance and trustworthiness. The pipeline demonstrates potential for
exploratory legal data analysis and as a precursor to supervised learning tasks
but requires further refinement and domain-specific adaptation for practical
legal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care globally, but regulatory interventions are poorly understood due to information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply chains.

Method: Uses Large Language Models to simulate bounded-rational decision-making between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and regulatory agencies through a sequential production game spanning multiple quarters, modeling FDA announcements and their impact on capacity investment.

Result: ShortageSim reduces resolution-lag percentage for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83%, bringing simulated durations more aligned to ground truth than zero-shot baseline.

Conclusion: Provides a novel computational framework for designing and testing interventions in complex, information-scarce supply chains, with open-source code and dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events.

Abstract: Drug shortages pose critical risks to patient care and healthcare systems
worldwide, yet the effectiveness of regulatory interventions remains poorly
understood due to fundamental information asymmetries in pharmaceutical supply
chains. We present \textbf{ShortageSim}, the first Large Language Model
(LLM)-based multi-agent simulation framework that captures the complex,
strategic interactions between drug manufacturers, institutional buyers, and
regulatory agencies in response to shortage alerts. Unlike traditional
game-theoretic models that assume perfect rationality and complete information,
\textbf{ShortageSim} leverages LLMs to simulate bounded-rational
decision-making under uncertainty. Through a sequential production game
spanning multiple quarters, we model how FDA announcements, both reactive
alerts about existing shortages and proactive warnings about potential
disruptions, propagate through the supply chain and influence capacity
investment and procurement decisions. Our experiments on historical shortage
events reveal that \textbf{ShortageSim} reduces the resolution-lag percentage
for discontinued-disclosed cases by 83\%, bringing simulated durations more
aligned to ground truth than the zero-shot baseline. We open-source
\textbf{ShortageSim} and a dataset of 2,925 FDA shortage events at

*Maria F. Alcala-Durand,J. Camilo Puerta-Acevedo,Julián D. Arias-Londoño,Juan I. Godino-Llorente*

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: Eye movement analysis using gaze-based features and machine learning achieves 0.95 AUC for Parkinson's Disease screening through visual exploration tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration like Parkinson's Disease, providing a non-invasive screening method.

Method: Combines classic oculomotor features (saccade count, fixation duration) with gaze cluster features from six visual exploration tests, using Mixture of Experts ensemble to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes.

Result: Ensemble models achieved 0.95 AUC on held-out test set, outperforming individual classifiers.

Conclusion: Visual exploration tasks with gaze analysis provide an effective non-invasive tool for early automatic screening of Parkinson's Disease.

Abstract: Eye movements can reveal early signs of neurodegeneration, including those
associated with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This work investigates the utility of
a set of gaze-based features for the automatic screening of PD from different
visual exploration tasks. For this purpose, a novel methodology is introduced,
combining classic fixation/saccade oculomotor features (e.g., saccade count,
fixation duration, scanned area) with features derived from gaze clusters
(i.e., regions with a considerable accumulation of fixations). These features
are automatically extracted from six exploration tests and evaluated using
different machine learning classifiers. A Mixture of Experts ensemble is used
to integrate outputs across tests and both eyes. Results show that ensemble
models outperform individual classifiers, achieving an Area Under the Receiving
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.95 on a held-out test set. The
findings support visual exploration as a non-invasive tool for early automatic
screening of PD.

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging
data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are
predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We
present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering
framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA
combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to
produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method
supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes
to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking
platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across
multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases,
improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%,
and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis
and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dimensionality reduction methods struggle to capture meaningful semantic changes over time in real-world datasets like artists' works or social media histories.

Method: Combines force-based projection and streaming clustering methods to build spatial-temporal maps of embeddings for time-based data visualization.

Result: Successfully demonstrated utility through use cases on text and image data, providing a new lens for understanding temporal dataset aesthetics and semantics.

Conclusion: Chronotome offers an effective approach for visualizing and exploring semantic evolution in temporal datasets, addressing limitations of traditional dimensionality reduction methods.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets -- from an artist's body of work to a person's
social media history -- exhibit meaningful semantic changes over time that are

*Sharjeel Tahir,Judith Johnson,Jumana Abu-Khalaf,Syed Afaq Ali Shah*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: E-THER is the first multimodal dataset with verbal-visual incongruence annotations for training AI systems to develop genuine empathy, showing improved performance in therapeutic conversations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current empathic AI systems fail to recognize when verbal expressions don't reflect true emotional states due to datasets focusing only on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing verbal-visual mismatch patterns.

Method: Created E-THER dataset with multidimensional annotations for verbal-visual incongruence detection, grounded in Person-Centered Therapy principles, including engagement scores and emotional misalignment identification from client-counsellor interactions.

Result: Vision-language models (IDEFICS, VideoLLAVA) trained on E-THER showed notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities, outperforming general-purpose models in sustaining therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial linguistic patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT framework.

Conclusion: The E-THER dataset enables training of AI systems with genuine empathic capabilities by addressing verbal-visual incongruence, leading to significant improvements in therapeutic conversational AI performance.

Abstract: A prevalent shortfall among current empathic AI systems is their inability to
recognize when verbal expressions may not fully reflect underlying emotional
states. This is because the existing datasets, used for the training of these
systems, focus on surface-level emotion recognition without addressing the
complex verbal-visual incongruence (mismatch) patterns useful for empathic
understanding. In this paper, we present E-THER, the first Person-Centered
Therapy-grounded multimodal dataset with multidimensional annotations for
verbal-visual incongruence detection, enabling training of AI systems that
develop genuine rather than performative empathic capabilities. The annotations
included in the dataset are drawn from humanistic approach, i.e., identifying
verbal-visual emotional misalignment in client-counsellor interactions -
forming a framework for training and evaluating AI on empathy tasks. Additional
engagement scores provide behavioral annotations for research applications.
Notable gains in empathic and therapeutic conversational qualities are observed
in state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as IDEFICS and
VideoLLAVA, using evaluation metrics grounded in empathic and therapeutic
principles. Empirical findings indicate that our incongruence-trained models
outperform general-purpose models in critical traits, such as sustaining
therapeutic engagement, minimizing artificial or exaggerated linguistic
patterns, and maintaining fidelity to PCT theoretical framework.

TL;DR: Bare-hand skin input for AR/VR using only RGB cameras from existing headsets, achieving high accuracy across diverse conditions with rich input metadata.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-body input offers speed, accuracy and ergonomic benefits over current in-air interfaces, but lacks practical implementation methods for AR/VR systems.

Method: Uses RGB camera (already integrated in modern XR headsets) for bare hands skin input without special instrumentation, with a pipeline that provides touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation metadata.

Result: High accuracy and robustness across diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (including input while walking).

Conclusion: Provides the technical foundation to unlock practical on-skin interfaces that have been well-motivated in HCI literature but previously lacked robust implementation methods.

Abstract: In augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) experiences, a user's arms and hands
can provide a convenient and tactile surface for touch input. Prior work has
shown on-body input to have significant speed, accuracy, and ergonomic benefits
over in-air interfaces, which are common today. In this work, we demonstrate
high accuracy, bare hands (i.e., no special instrumentation of the user) skin
input using just an RGB camera, like those already integrated into all modern
XR headsets. Our results show this approach can be accurate, and robust across
diverse lighting conditions, skin tones, and body motion (e.g., input while
walking). Finally, our pipeline also provides rich input metadata including
touch force, finger identification, angle of attack, and rotation. We believe
these are the requisite technical ingredients to more fully unlock on-skin
interfaces that have been well motivated in the HCI literature but have lacked
robust and practical methods.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition is vital for human-computer interaction,
particularly for low-resource languages like Arabic, which face challenges due
to limited data and research. We introduce ArabEmoNet, a lightweight
architecture designed to overcome these limitations and deliver
state-of-the-art performance. Unlike previous systems relying on discrete MFCC
features and 1D convolutions, which miss nuanced spectro-temporal patterns,
ArabEmoNet uses Mel spectrograms processed through 2D convolutions, preserving
critical emotional cues often lost in traditional methods.

TL;DR: A neural speech codec using single-stage quantization on mel-spectrogram patches that achieves competitive quality at 7.5 kbits/s without complex RVQ stacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the need for complex residual vector quantization stacks in neural speech codecs by introducing a simpler, single-stage quantization approach that enables low-latency streaming.

Method: Operates directly on mel-spectrogram treated as 2D data, quantizing non-overlapping 4x4 patches into a shared codebook. Uses late-stage adversarial fine-tuning for VQ-VAE and trains HiFi-GAN vocoder on reconstructed spectrograms.

Result: Achieves competitive perceptual quality and intelligibility at ~7.5 kbits/s for 16kHz speech, validated against state-of-the-art codecs using STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL metrics.

Conclusion: The simplified non-residual architecture provides an effective and open foundation for future low-latency codec designs, demonstrating that complex RVQ stacks are not necessary for high-quality speech coding.

Abstract: We present a neural speech codec that challenges the need for complex
residual vector quantization (RVQ) stacks by introducing a simpler,
single-stage quantization approach. Our method operates directly on the
mel-spectrogram, treating it as a 2D data and quantizing non-overlapping 4x4
patches into a single, shared codebook. This patchwise design simplifies the
architecture, enables low-latency streaming, and yields a discrete latent grid.
To ensure high-fidelity synthesis, we employ a late-stage adversarial
fine-tuning for the VQ-VAE and train a HiFi-GAN vocoder from scratch on the
codec's reconstructed spectrograms. Operating at approximately 7.5 kbits/s for
16 kHz speech, our system was evaluated against several state-of-the-art neural
codecs using objective metrics such as STOI, PESQ, MCD, and ViSQOL. The results
demonstrate that our simplified, non-residual architecture achieves competitive
perceptual quality and intelligibility, validating it as an effective and open
foundation for future low-latency codec designs.

*Yiqun Yao,Xiang Li,Xin Jiang,Xuezhi Fang,Naitong Yu,Wenjia Ma,Aixin Sun,Yequan Wang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: Proposes natural monologues with dual training paradigm to align text and audio at different bitrates for full-duplex dialog models, achieving superior performance with FLM-Audio 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing full-duplex models face challenges aligning textual monologues with audio streams at different bitrates. Word-level alignment degrades language ability of pre-trained models and requires costly timestamp annotations.

Method: Uses textual monologues in continuous token sequences (natural monologues) and alternates position (leading or trailing audio) across training stages for temporal alignment.

Result: FLM-Audio 7B model demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting experiences compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed natural monologues with dual training paradigm effectively solves alignment challenges and enables high-performance full-duplex spoken dialog models.

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously
with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches,
native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in
a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to
time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet,
a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that
operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level
alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained
models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which
introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper,
we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural"
monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal
alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or
trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training
paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog
model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting
experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: Analysis of 10,000 COVID-19 YouTube videos (2023-2024) showing engagement patterns driven by publishing timing, title keywords, sentiment, and video duration categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how temporal, lexical, linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement with COVID-19 content on YouTube during the late pandemic period.

Method: Analyzed 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published between January 2023 and October 2024, examining publishing patterns, lexical analysis of titles, sentiment analysis of descriptions, and category-level duration effects.

Result: Found weekday publishing effects with peak views shifting from Monday to Friday; videos with "shorts" in titles attracted highest views (2.16M avg); sentiment showed weak correlation initially but stronger after outlier removal; entertainment shorts averaged 288K views while news/politics videos averaged ~55K views.

Conclusion: COVID-19 video engagement during late pandemic followed distinct patterns influenced by publishing schedules, title vocabulary, topics, and genre-specific duration effects, with entertainment shorts performing best and news content receiving lower engagement.

Abstract: This work investigated about 10,000 COVID-19-related YouTube videos published
between January 2023 and October 2024 to evaluate how temporal, lexical,
linguistic, and structural factors influenced engagement during the late
pandemic period. Publishing activity showed consistent weekday effects: in the
first window, average views peaked on Mondays at 92,658; in the second, on
Wednesdays at 115,479; and in the third, on Fridays at 84,874, reflecting a
shift in audience attention toward mid- and late week. Lexical analysis of
video titles revealed recurring high-frequency keywords related to COVID-19 and
YouTube features, including COVID, coronavirus, shorts, and live. Frequency
analysis revealed sharp spikes, with COVID appearing in 799 video titles in
August 2024, while engagement analysis showed that videos titled with shorts
attracted very high views, peaking at 2.16 million average views per video in
June 2023. Analysis of sentiment of video descriptions in English showed weak
correlation with views in the raw data (Pearson r = 0.0154, p = 0.2987), but
stronger correlations emerged once outliers were addressed, with Spearman r =
0.110 (p < 0.001) and Pearson r = 0.0925 (p < 0.001). Category-level analysis
of video durations revealed contrasting outcomes: long videos focusing on
people and blogs averaged 209,114 views, short entertainment videos averaged
288,675 views, and medium-to-long news and politics videos averaged 51,309 and
59,226 views, respectively. These results demonstrate that engagement patterns
of COVID-19-related videos on YouTube during the late pandemic followed
distinct characteristics driven by publishing schedules, title vocabulary,
topics, and genre-specific duration effects.

TL;DR: Traj-MLLM is a novel framework that uses multimodal large language models for trajectory data mining, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks without requiring training data or fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory analysis methods suffer from generalization problems - they are either restricted to specific regions or only suitable for few tasks. The paper explores whether MLLMs can solve this generalization challenge in trajectory data mining.

Method: Proposes Traj-MLLM which integrates multiview contexts to transform raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving spatial-temporal characteristics. Uses MLLMs' reasoning ability directly and includes a prompt optimization method for task adaptation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 48.05% on travel time estimation, 15.52% on mobility prediction, 51.52% on anomaly detection, and 1.83% on transportation mode identification across four datasets.

Conclusion: Traj-MLLM successfully demonstrates that MLLMs can effectively reform trajectory data mining, achieving superior performance across diverse tasks and geographic regions without requiring training data or fine-tuning of MLLM backbones.

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across
different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet
important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from
the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for
specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs
reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due
to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal
trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain
the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}},
which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By
integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories
into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal
characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for
trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to
finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on
four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on
travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and
transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves
these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning
the MLLM backbones.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: LGSRR uses LLMs to extract fine-grained semantics and guide relational reasoning for multimodal intent understanding, achieving state-of-the-art performance without manual priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods have limitations in modality-level reliance and relational reasoning for complex intent understanding from multimodal signals.

Method: Proposes LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) with LLM-based fine-grained semantic extraction using shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought, and models three fundamental semantic relations based on logical principles.

Result: Extensive experiments show LGSRR's superiority over state-of-the-art methods with consistent performance gains across diverse semantic understanding scenarios.

Conclusion: LGSRR effectively enhances relational reasoning for multimodal intent understanding by leveraging LLM knowledge and formal semantic relation modeling.

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing
human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world
scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their
modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained
semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel
LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the
expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic
foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance.
Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained
semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks
semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors.
Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations
grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable
more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent
and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over
state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse
semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate longitudinal lesion segmentation is crucial for monitoring disease progression, but existing automated methods struggle with consistent lesion tracking across time points.

Method: Extended LongiSeg framework with promptable capabilities using point and mask interactions, and leveraged large-scale pretraining on synthetic longitudinal CT dataset to overcome limited training data.

Result: Pretraining substantially improved longitudinal context exploitation, achieving up to 6 Dice points improvement compared to models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: Combining longitudinal context with interactive prompting is effective for robust lesion tracking, demonstrating the value of pretraining on synthetic data for medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions in longitudinal whole-body CT is essential
for monitoring disease progression and treatment response. While automated
methods benefit from incorporating longitudinal information, they remain
limited in their ability to consistently track individual lesions across time.
Task 2 of the autoPET/CT IV Challenge addresses this by providing lesion
localizations and baseline delineations, framing the problem as longitudinal
promptable segmentation. In this work, we extend the recently proposed LongiSeg
framework with promptable capabilities, enabling lesion-specific tracking
through point and mask interactions. To address the limited size of the
provided training set, we leverage large-scale pretraining on a synthetic
longitudinal CT dataset. Our experiments show that pretraining substantially
improves the ability to exploit longitudinal context, yielding an improvement
of up to 6 Dice points compared to models trained from scratch. These findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of combining longitudinal context with
interactive prompting for robust lesion tracking. Code is publicly available at

*Yizhe Zhang,Qiang Chen,Tao Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Omnimodels like Gemini 2.5 Pro show competitive performance against specialized medical image segmentation models, with task-dependent results - excelling on hard cases for polyp and breast tumor segmentation but lagging in fine-grained retinal vessel tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether general-purpose omnimodels can match the performance of specialized domain-specific models in high-stakes medical image segmentation tasks.

Method: Comparative zero-shot analysis of Gemini 2.5 Pro omnimodel against specialized deep learning models on three medical segmentation tasks (polyp, retinal vessel, breast tumor), focusing on performance extremes by curating easiest and hardest case subsets.

Result: Specialist models excel on easy samples for polyp and breast tumor segmentation, but omnimodel shows greater robustness on hard cases. For retinal vessel segmentation, specialist maintains superiority across all cases. Omnimodels demonstrate higher sensitivity to subtle anatomical features.

Conclusion: Current omnimodels are not universal replacements for specialists but offer complementary strengths, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing
diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these
``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in
knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the
high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study

Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on
three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast
tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the
extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on
the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and
task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist
models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness
on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the
fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model
maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly,
qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity,
identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results
indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for
specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with
specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge
cases.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Deep learning model using DBT imaging achieves 0.80 AUROC for 5-year breast cancer risk prediction, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early breast cancer detection improves outcomes, but current risk models have modest performance and don't incorporate DBT imaging approved in 2011.

Method: Deep learning framework using Meta AI DINOv2 image encoder on 161,753 DBT exams from 50,590 patients, with cumulative hazard layer for 5-year risk assessment.

Result: Best model achieved AUROC of 0.80 on held-out test set for 5-year breast cancer risk predictions.

Conclusion: DBT-based deep learning shows high potential to complement traditional risk assessment tools and provides promising foundation for further validation.

Abstract: As early detection of breast cancer strongly favors successful therapeutic
outcomes, there is major commercial interest in optimizing breast cancer
screening. However, current risk prediction models achieve modest performance
and do not incorporate digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging, which was
FDA-approved for breast cancer screening in 2011. To address this unmet need,
we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework capable of forecasting an
individual patient's 5-year breast cancer risk directly from screening DBT.
Using an unparalleled dataset of 161,753 DBT examinations from 50,590 patients,
we trained a risk predictor based on features extracted using the Meta AI
DINOv2 image encoder, combined with a cumulative hazard layer, to assess a
patient's likelihood of developing breast cancer over five years. On a held-out
test set, our best-performing model achieved an AUROC of 0.80 on predictions
within 5 years. These findings reveal the high potential of DBT-based DL
approaches to complement traditional risk assessment tools, and serve as a
promising basis for additional investigation to validate and enhance our work.

TL;DR: Integrated ultrasound nomogram combining BIRADS features and morphometric characteristics outperforms radiologists and ChatGPT in breast lesion biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop and validate integrated ultrasound tools that can improve biopsy decision-making and malignancy prediction for breast lesions, potentially reducing unnecessary biopsies.

Method: Retrospective multicenter study of 1747 women with pathologically confirmed breast lesions. Developed BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomograms via logistic regression, compared against radiologists and ChatGPT models.

Result: Fused nomogram achieved highest accuracy (83.0% biopsy recommendation, 83.8% malignancy prediction) with AUCs of 0.901 and 0.853, outperforming all other models and human experts.

Conclusion: Integrated BIRADS-morphometric nomograms are superior to standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists, offering interpretable tools to reduce unnecessary biopsies and enhance personalized breast imaging decisions.

Abstract: To develop and externally validate integrated ultrasound nomograms combining
BIRADS features and quantitative morphometric characteristics, and to compare
their performance with expert radiologists and state of the art large language
models in biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction for breast lesions.
In this retrospective multicenter, multinational study, 1747 women with
pathologically confirmed breast lesions underwent ultrasound across three
centers in Iran and Turkey. A total of 10 BIRADS and 26 morphological features
were extracted from each lesion. A BIRADS, morphometric, and fused nomogram
integrating both feature sets was constructed via logistic regression. Three
radiologists (one senior, two general) and two ChatGPT variants independently
interpreted deidentified breast lesion images. Diagnostic performance for
biopsy recommendation (BIRADS 4,5) and malignancy prediction was assessed in
internal and two external validation cohorts. In pooled analysis, the fused
nomogram achieved the highest accuracy for biopsy recommendation (83.0%) and
malignancy prediction (83.8%), outperforming the morphometric nomogram, three
radiologists and both ChatGPT models. Its AUCs were 0.901 and 0.853 for the two
tasks, respectively. In addition, the performance of the BIRADS nomogram was
significantly higher than the morphometric nomogram, three radiologists and
both ChatGPT models for biopsy recommendation and malignancy prediction.
External validation confirmed the robust generalizability across different
ultrasound platforms and populations. An integrated BIRADS morphometric
nomogram consistently outperforms standalone models, LLMs, and radiologists in
guiding biopsy decisions and predicting malignancy. These interpretable,
externally validated tools have the potential to reduce unnecessary biopsies
and enhance personalized decision making in breast imaging.

These inspired new method developments including invertibility constraints, pyramid features, keypoints alignment, and instance optimization.

Result: The paper presents new benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics for medical image registration that address the limitations of previous editions, though specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The Learn2Reg 2024 challenge expands the scope of medical image registration benchmarking by introducing more diverse and complex tasks, enabling more comprehensive evaluation of registration methods and driving new methodological developments in the field.

Abstract: Medical image registration is critical for clinical applications, and fair
benchmarking of different methods is essential for monitoring ongoing progress.
To date, the Learn2Reg 2020-2023 challenges have released several complementary
datasets and established metrics for evaluations. However, these editions did

### [377] [From Attack Descriptions to Vulnerabilities: A Sentence Transformer-Based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02077)
*Refat Othman,Diaeddin Rimawi,Bruno Rossi,Barbara Russo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Evaluation of 14 sentence transformers for automatically mapping cyber attacks to CVE vulnerabilities, with multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 model achieving best performance (F1=89.0) and discovering 275 undocumented attack-vulnerability links.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual mapping of attacks to vulnerabilities is infeasible, creating need for automation to enable timely incident response and provide defenders with actionable insights for security incidents.

Method: Evaluated 14 state-of-the-art sentence transformers for automatically identifying vulnerabilities from textual attack descriptions, focusing on performance metrics and comparison with MITRE CVE repositories.

Result: MMPNet model achieved superior performance with F1-score of 89.0, precision 84.0, recall 94.7. Model identified 56-61% of vulnerabilities matching CVE repository, plus 275 undocumented attack-vulnerability links.

Conclusion: Automating attack-vulnerability linking enhances detection/response capabilities, reduces vulnerability exploit window, and contributes to more secure systems through discovery of undocumented relationships.

Abstract: In the domain of security, vulnerabilities frequently remain undetected even
after their exploitation. In this work, vulnerabilities refer to publicly
disclosed flaws documented in Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
reports. Establishing a connection between attacks and vulnerabilities is
essential for enabling timely incident response, as it provides defenders with
immediate, actionable insights. However, manually mapping attacks to CVEs is
infeasible, thereby motivating the need for automation. This paper evaluates 14
state-of-the-art (SOTA) sentence transformers for automatically identifying
vulnerabilities from textual descriptions of attacks. Our results demonstrate
that the multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieves superior
classification performance when using attack Technique descriptions, with an
F1-score of 89.0, precision of 84.0, and recall of 94.7. Furthermore, it was
observed that, on average, 56% of the vulnerabilities identified by the MMPNet
model are also represented within the CVE repository in conjunction with an
attack, while 61% of the vulnerabilities detected by the model correspond to
those cataloged in the CVE repository. A manual inspection of the results
revealed the existence of 275 predicted links that were not documented in the
MITRE repositories. Consequently, the automation of linking attack techniques
to vulnerabilities not only enhances the detection and response capabilities
related to software security incidents but also diminishes the duration during
which vulnerabilities remain exploitable, thereby contributing to the
development of more secure systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A computational framework for social learning that integrates linguistic guidance with direct experience through joint probabilistic inference over executable world models, using pretrained language models to generate and interpret advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how humans combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience for safe and rapid learning, and to develop AI systems that can similarly integrate these knowledge sources.

Method: Joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models using sensorimotor and linguistic data. A pretrained language model is converted into a probabilistic model of human advice-sharing, enabling both advice generation and interpretation during Bayesian inference.

Result: Linguistic guidance shaped exploration and accelerated learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries across 10 video games. Successful knowledge transfer between humans and models was demonstrated through iterated learning experiments.

Conclusion: Structured, language-compatible representations enable effective human-machine collaborative learning and knowledge accumulation across generations, providing a framework for integrating social and experiential learning in AI systems.

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience
is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new
environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how
might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social
learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world
models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning
a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share
advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate
advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian
inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games,
we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning
by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans
and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations
through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge
transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured,
language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative
learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in high-stakes decisions, ensuring alignment with human values is crucial. Proprietary APIs limit reproducibility and broad participation, so the study explores whether local open-source ensemble debates can improve alignment-oriented reasoning.

Method: Conducted 150 debates across 15 scenarios using five ensemble configurations. Compared ensemble performance against single-model baselines using a 7-point evaluation rubric.

Result: Ensembles outperformed single models (3.48 vs 3.13 overall), with largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%). Strongest improvements in truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80 points).

Conclusion: Open-source ensemble debates provide an effective and reproducible approach for improving alignment evaluation, offering accessible alternatives to proprietary APIs while enhancing reasoning quality and truthfulness.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes

outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13),
with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality
(+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human
enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing

### [380] [Adaptive Monitoring and Real-World Evaluation of Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00115)
*Manish Shukla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm for agentic AI systems, addressing limitations of previous work by providing algorithmic implementation and empirical validation of multi-axis evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations of agentic AI systems predominantly focus on technical capabilities (83% of papers) while neglecting human-centered and economic considerations (only 30%). There's a need for comprehensive monitoring that goes beyond basic metrics to ensure safe deployment in high-stakes domains.

Method: Developed an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that: 1) normalizes heterogeneous metrics, 2) applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds, and 3) performs joint anomaly detection using Mahalanobis distance. Conducted simulations and real-world experiments to validate the approach.

Result: AMDM significantly improves performance: reduces anomaly-detection latency from 12.3s to 5.6s on simulated goal drift, and cuts false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared to static thresholds. Provides comparison tables, ROC/PR curves, and case study reanalysis.

Conclusion: The AMDM algorithm effectively addresses the gap in comprehensive monitoring of agentic AI systems, demonstrating practical improvements in detection speed and accuracy while emphasizing the importance of multi-dimensional evaluation beyond technical capabilities alone.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine
large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are
rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our
earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary
metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an
algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills
that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to
show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of
84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only
30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an
Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises
heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average
thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance.
Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts
anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and
reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds.
We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies
to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist
accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

TL;DR: SuperBrain framework enables collective intelligence through co-evolution of LLMs and humans, progressing from individual cognitive dyads to emergent meta-intelligence via evolutionary optimization and swarm coordination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond static prompt engineering and isolated agent simulations by creating a dynamic, scalable collective intelligence system that evolves through human-LLM interaction and coordination.

Method: Four-stage approach: (1) Subclass Brain formation through personalized user-LLM interaction, (2) GA-assisted forward-backward evolution for prompt refinement, (3) Swarm Intelligence coordination of multiple Subclass Brains, (4) Integration into Superclass Brain meta-intelligence.

Result: Initial implementations demonstrated in UAV scheduling and keyword filtering tasks, with proposed registry for cross-dyad knowledge consolidation.

Conclusion: Provides conceptual foundation and architectural roadmap for scalable, explainable, and ethically aligned collective AI systems through emergent meta-intelligence.

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded
in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike
static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach
emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A
Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user
and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through
GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts
and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm
Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and
exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive
signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence
capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the
theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling,
KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge
consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an
architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned
collective AI.

TL;DR: A modular multi-agent framework for legal reasoning that separates knowledge acquisition from application, achieving 76.4% accuracy on tax calculation tasks compared to 18.8% baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal reasoning requires precise interpretation of statutes and consistent rule application, which presents challenges for AI systems that need to bridge natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning while maintaining transparency.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules into verifiable intermediate representations; 2) Three-step application: query analysis to map case facts, symbolic inference for logical conclusions, and programmatic implementation using ontological knowledge.

Result: Substantial improvements on statutory tax calculation tasks - foundational models achieved 76.4% accuracy compared to 18.8% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models.

Conclusion: Modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while enhancing consistency and explainability, establishing a foundation for transparent and trustworthy AI legal systems.

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering by moving beyond single-pass RAG systems and providing more reliable, verifiable legal information retrieval.

Method: Decomposes queries into subproblems, performs targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (web, local RAG, case law), and uses a Judge Agent for verification of sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity in an iterative reasoning-search-verification loop.

Result: Substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges on the LegalSearchQA benchmark of 200 up-to-date legal questions.

Conclusion: Multi-agent reasoning with agentic search provides a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes legal domains requiring precise retrieval and deliberation.

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and
Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal
question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval.
Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes
queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources
(Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to
verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer
synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains
coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We
evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple
choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves
factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores
from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that
multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible
blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal
retrieval and deliberation.

TL;DR: Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS) improves AI materials discovery by selecting physically admissible reasoning traces for training, enhancing accuracy and reducing physics violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-driven materials discovery uses binary correctness or preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility, leading to unreliable predictions.

Method: Introduces Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS) that selects reasoning traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, using lightweight halting for compute control.

Result: Improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost compared to baselines under matched token budgets.

Conclusion: Domain-aware constraints with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient large reasoning models for process-aware property prediction and materials design.

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with
algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property
predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We
approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To
instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces
from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines
select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals
that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware
Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors
traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets,
with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with
a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher
model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection
sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces
physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These
results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with
trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs
for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems remains low due to behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers rather than technical failures, highlighting the need for effective persuasive AI to address these challenges.

Method: The framework includes a library of expert-validated virtual patients with clinically grounded profiles and adoption barriers, simulating multi-turn interactions with nurse agents using evidence-based persuasive strategies, and supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios.

Result: While larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure, revealing critical limitations of current LLMs for behavior change.

Conclusion: ChatCLIDS provides a high-fidelity, scalable testbed for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare, demonstrating that current LLMs have significant limitations in overcoming real-world adoption barriers despite their adaptive capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1
diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse
behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the
first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for
health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated
virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and
realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse
agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies.
ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social
influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our
findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies
over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under
realistic social pressure. These results highlight critical limitations of
current LLMs for behavior change, and offer a high-fidelity, scalable testbed
for advancing trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and beyond.

TL;DR: ReaL-TG is a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs for explainable link forecasting on temporal graphs, outperforming larger models while producing high-quality explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional temporal graph neural networks lack explainability and cannot handle unseen graphs without retraining. Existing LLM approaches are limited to static graphs or small synthetic datasets and don't evaluate reasoning trace quality.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs using outcome-based rewards to encourage self-exploration of reasoning strategies from graph structure and production of explanations that justify predictions.

Result: ReaL-TG-4B (fine-tuned Qwen3-4B) outperforms much larger frontier LLMs including GPT-5 mini on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations validated by both LLM judge and human evaluation.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world temporal graphs, demonstrating superior performance and reasoning quality compared to larger models.

Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning,
requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones.
Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve
strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen
graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large
language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to
static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of
reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced
Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that
fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs.
ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning
strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly
justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning
traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an
LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the
impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning
Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier
LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality
explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

*Jaewoo Ahn,Junseo Kim,Heeseung Yun,Jaehyeon Son,Dongmin Park,Jaewoong Cho,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FlashAdventure benchmark with 34 Flash adventure games tests full story completion and observation-behavior gap. COAST framework with clue memory improves milestone completion but still lags behind human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing game benchmarks lack diversity and don't evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. Adventure games pose additional challenges through complex narrative-driven interactions.

Method: Introduces FlashAdventure benchmark, CUA-as-a-Judge automated evaluator, and COAST agentic framework with long-term clue memory for better planning and solving sequential tasks.

Result: Current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs. COAST improves milestone completion by addressing the observation-behavior gap, but still shows significant performance gap compared to humans.

Conclusion: While COAST represents progress in bridging the observation-behavior gap, the marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents indicates need for continued research to narrow this performance divide.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital
environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their
varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through
complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack
diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To
address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based
adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the
observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier
gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay
evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to
better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents
struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by
bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy
between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts
to narrow this divide.

*Dongfu Jiang,Yi Lu,Zhuofeng Li,Zhiheng Lyu,Ping Nie,Haozhe Wang,Alex Su,Hui Chen,Kai Zou,Chao Du,Tianyu Pang,Wenhu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VerlTool is a unified framework that addresses limitations in Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) by providing modular tool integration, asynchronous execution, and standardized APIs across multiple domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ARLT approaches suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains, hindering community adoption and algorithmic innovation.

Method: Developed VerlTool with four key contributions: upstream alignment with VeRL, unified tool management via standardized APIs, asynchronous rollout execution, and comprehensive evaluation across 6 ARLT domains using multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens.

Result: Achieved near 2× speedup through asynchronous execution, competitive performance across mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, with results comparable to specialized systems.

Conclusion: VerlTool provides a scalable, modular foundation for tool-augmented RL research with rapid tool integration capabilities and significantly reduced development overhead, enabling broader community adoption.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated
success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to
single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic
Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address
multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases
that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited
extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community
adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and
modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design
principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment
with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool
management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code
execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous
rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating
synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating
competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as
multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video),
extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on
mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web
search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to
specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The
modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only
lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and
providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

### [390] [Question-to-Knowledge: Multi-Agent Generation of Inspectable Facts for Product Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01182)
*Wonduk Seo,Taesub Shin,Hyunjin An,Dokyun Kim,Seunghyun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Q2K is a multi-agent LLM framework that improves SKU mapping accuracy by generating targeted questions, performing focused web searches, and reusing validated reasoning to handle product listing variations without explicit identifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional rule-based heuristics and keyword similarity methods often fail at SKU mapping due to subtle product variations across platforms when explicit identifiers are missing, leading to misclassification.

Method: Proposes Q2K framework with three agents: Reasoning Agent generates disambiguation questions, Knowledge Agent performs focused web searches to resolve them, and Deduplication Agent reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy. Includes human-in-the-loop for uncertain cases.

Result: Experiments on real-world consumer goods datasets show Q2K outperforms strong baselines with higher accuracy and robustness, particularly in challenging scenarios like bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation.

Conclusion: Q2K provides a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration by balancing accuracy with efficiency through reasoning reuse instead of repeated searches, effectively addressing SKU mapping challenges in ecommerce.

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit
(SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit
identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule
based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by
overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle
configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge
(Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for
reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates
targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via
focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated
reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the
loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world
consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving
higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle
identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning
instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency,
offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

*Mattia Tritto,Giuseppe Farano,Dario Di Palma,Gaetano Rossiello,Fedelucio Narducci,Dharmashankar Subramanian,Tommaso Di Noia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORMs outperform traditional test-time strategies (ex-BoN and Maj) for Text-to-SQL tasks, achieving significant accuracy gains on BIRD and Spider benchmarks by better aligning SQL queries with user intent through semantic correctness evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with complex Text-to-SQL queries that require precise alignment between user intent and database schema. Traditional test-time strategies like execution-based Best-of-N and Majority Voting rely on surface-level heuristics rather than semantic correctness.

Method: Introduced a framework for training Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) that assign utility scores to generated SQL queries based on semantic correctness. Evaluated on BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks using various open-source LLMs including Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 families.

Result: ORMs achieved execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. Fine-tuned models like OmniSQL showed superior ORM performance, with competitive results on simple queries and better scaling with more candidates.

Conclusion: ORMs provide a more effective heuristic for Text-to-SQL than traditional methods, better aligning model predictions with user intent through semantic evaluation, and show particular strength when fine-tuned on SQL-aligned models.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL
queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language
Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users.
Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still
struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user
intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as
Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the
assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple
attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting
either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or
the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models
(ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic
correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model
predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL
remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare
them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the
Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks,
finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3
model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving
execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and
+2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that
finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields
superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve
competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number
of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

*Rui Zhao,Vladyslav Melnychuk,Jun Zhao,Jesse Wright,Nigel Shadbolt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A semantic approach using LLMs to automatically extract privacy practices from policies and construct knowledge graphs, enabling large-scale privacy policy analysis and formal representation generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users rarely read privacy policies due to complexity, creating barriers for user-centered web approaches and data sharing. Existing methods lack scalable ways to create formal policy representations.

Method: Uses state-of-the-art LLMs to identify key privacy information, constructs Pr²Graph knowledge graph grounded in Data Privacy Vocabulary, and demonstrates generation of formal policy representations like ODRL and psDToU.

Result: Created Pr²Graph for top-100 websites as public resource, enriched Policy-IE dataset with expert annotations, benchmarked LLM performance, and verified technology capabilities for privacy practice analysis.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of large-scale privacy policy analysis using LLMs, providing public datasets and tools to audit web privacy practices and support downstream applications.

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming
otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of
data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches,
and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research
proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the
compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy
policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of
such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using
state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key
information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct
$\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy
Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with
the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular
websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for
analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used
to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such
as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use
(psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE
dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked
the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and
verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of
large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising
direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source
code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CSA is a new safety paradigm that shifts from simple refusal-based safety to constructive guidance, helping vulnerable users while maintaining protection against malicious use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety approaches focus too narrowly on adversarial risks and simple refusals, which can be harmful when dealing with psychologically distressed users seeking help.

Method: Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA) combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control.

Result: Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models, strong constructive engagement close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on jailbreak datasets nearing GPT-o1 levels.

Conclusion: CSA redefines model-user relationships by making systems not just safe but meaningfully helpful, shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent
harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks
posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and
relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come
from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,
self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly
influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,
escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce
Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects
against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe
and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic
anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and
interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.
Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high
general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong
constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the
Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from
refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user
relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully
helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,
user-centered AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-simulated tutoring dialogues lack the pedagogical richness of human dialogues, showing structural simplification and behavioral convergence compared to human's cognitively guided, diverse teaching patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human tutoring dialogues, as current LLMs face challenges in generating pedagogically rich interactions.

Method: Quantitative comparison using Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) to analyze tutoring dialogues.

Result: Human dialogues superior in utterance length, questioning behaviors, and general feedback. Human patterns show "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop with pedagogical guidance, while AI shows "explanation-simplistic response" loop with simple information transfer.

Conclusion: Reveals key limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provides empirical guidance for designing more pedagogically effective generative educational dialogue systems.

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as
critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning.
However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating
pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the
structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human
tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an
Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis
(ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to
their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and
general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a
fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more
cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual
response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and
student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of
structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an
"explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information
transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key
limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for
designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational
dialogue systems.

*Jonathn Chang,Leonard Piff,Suvadip Sana,Jasmine X. Li,Lionel Levine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EigenBench is a black-box benchmarking method that quantifies language models' value alignment using peer judgments and EigenTrust aggregation without ground truth labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of quantitative metrics for AI value alignment by creating a method to comparatively benchmark language models' adherence to specified value systems.

Method: Uses an ensemble of models to judge each other's outputs across scenarios based on a given constitution, then aggregates judgments using EigenTrust to produce alignment scores.

Result: EigenBench successfully quantifies value alignment and shows that most variance in scores comes from prompts rather than models, with a small residual capturing model disposition.

Conclusion: EigenBench provides a practical framework for measuring value alignment in language models without requiring ground truth, enabling comparative benchmarking of AI systems against human values.

Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the
lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a
black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given
an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset
of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's
alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges
the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are
aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a
weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground
truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges
may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether
EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that
most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual
quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

Motivation: To solve four fundamental problems in mobile agents: generalization across tasks/modalities/apps/devices, precise on-screen interaction accuracy, long-horizon multi-step task capability, and efficient runtime on resource-constrained devices.

Method: End-to-end autonomous pipeline with multimodal foundation models (Chinese-English support), chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning, multi-agent collaboration, user personalization, voice interaction, function calling, and cross-app/device orchestration with profiling-driven hardware optimization.

Result: Significant improvements across all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Conclusion: AppCopilot demonstrates a comprehensive solution to core mobile agent challenges through a full-stack, closed-loop system that delivers practical, scalable impact across applications and devices.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation
models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the
fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be
solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1)
generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy,
specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3)
long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency,
specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We
present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device
assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack,
closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this
position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection,
training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile
application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal
foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and
control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task
planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution
layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice
interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and
comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates
profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across
heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant
improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization,
higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion,
and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

TL;DR: UI-TARS-2 is a native GUI agent model that addresses key challenges in autonomous GUI agents through scalable data generation, multi-turn RL stabilization, hybrid environment integration, and unified sandbox platform, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address remaining challenges in native GUI agent development including data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning limitations, GUI-only operation constraints, and environment stability issues.

Method: Systematic training methodology featuring: data flywheel for scalable data generation, stabilized multi-turn RL framework, hybrid GUI environment integrating file systems and terminals, and unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts.

Result: Achieves 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming Claude and OpenAI agents. Attains 59.8 mean normalized score across 15-game suite (60% human-level performance), competitive with frontier proprietary models on LMGame-Bench.

Conclusion: UI-TARS-2 demonstrates significant improvements over predecessor, strong generalization to diverse agent tasks, and potential to advance GUI agent state with robustness in real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents for graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents major challenges in artificial intelligence. While recent advances in
native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning,
action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data
scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of
GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we
present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these
challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for
scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI
environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox
platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that
UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5.
On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on
WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines
such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean
normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level
performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g.,
OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to
long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks,
highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of
training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and
efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's
potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization
to real-world interactive scenarios.

TL;DR: Survey paper formalizing the shift from LLM-based RL to Agentic RL, proposing a taxonomy of agent capabilities and applications, with RL as the key mechanism for adaptive agent behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To document and formalize the paradigm shift from conventional LLM reinforcement learning to autonomous, decision-making agents in complex dynamic environments.

Method: Proposes a twofold taxonomy organized around core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, perception) and their applications across diverse task domains, synthesizing over 500 recent works.

Result: Comprehensive survey that consolidates open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium for future research.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning is critical for transforming static capabilities into adaptive agentic behavior, with opportunities and challenges for developing scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm
shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models
(LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous,
decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey
formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended,
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL.
Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one
organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use,
memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their
applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that
reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these
capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic
behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the
landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a
practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this

*Huang Fang,Mengxi Zhang,Heng Dong,Wei Li,Zixuan Wang,Qifeng Zhang,Xueyun Tian,Yucheng Hu,Hang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Robix is a unified vision-language model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction in a single architecture, outperforming commercial baselines like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro in interactive task execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a unified cognitive layer for robots that can handle complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with humans within an end-to-end framework, addressing the need for more sophisticated human-robot interaction capabilities.

Method: Three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining for embodied reasoning abilities, (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as unified reasoning-action sequences, and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and task coherence.

Result: Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types and various user-involved tasks like table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

Conclusion: Robix successfully integrates reasoning, planning, and interaction capabilities in a single model, enabling robots to handle complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with humans while demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art commercial models.

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task
planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language
architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot
system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level
controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to
follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally
with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel
capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and
context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix
leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training
strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning
abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and
task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot
interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3)
reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon
task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both
open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in
interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse
instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and
interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery
shopping, and dietary filtering.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require highly efficient matrix multiplication
engines for complex computations. This paper presents a systolic array
architecture incorporating novel exact and approximate processing elements
(PEs), designed using energy-efficient positive partial product and negative
partial product cells, termed as PPC and NPPC, respectively. The proposed 8-bit

### [401] [GS-TG: 3D Gaussian Splatting Accelerator with Tile Grouping for Reducing Redundant Sorting while Preserving Rasterization Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00911)
*Joongho Jo,Jongsun Park*

Main category: cs.AR

TL;DR: GS-TG is a tile-grouping accelerator that speeds up 3D Gaussian Splatting by reducing redundant sorting operations while maintaining rasterization efficiency through bitmask-based tile management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles to meet real-time FPS demands despite being faster than NeRF. There's a critical trade-off where increasing tile size reduces sorting redundancy but increases unnecessary rasterization computations.

Method: GS-TG groups small tiles during sorting to share operations across tiles, then uses bitmasks assigned to each Gaussian to identify relevant small tiles during rasterization, enabling efficient sharing of sorting results without retraining.

Result: Experimental results show GS-TG achieves an average 1.54x speed-up over state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

Conclusion: GS-TG provides a lossless acceleration method that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D-GS optimization techniques, effectively addressing the sorting-rasterization trade-off for real-time applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a promising alternative to
neural radiance fields (NeRF) as it offers high speed as well as high image
quality in novel view synthesis. Despite these advancements, 3D-GS still
struggles to meet the frames per second (FPS) demands of real-time
applications. In this paper, we introduce GS-TG, a tile-grouping-based
accelerator that enhances 3D-GS rendering speed by reducing redundant sorting
operations and preserving rasterization efficiency. GS-TG addresses a critical
trade-off issue in 3D-GS rendering: increasing the tile size effectively
reduces redundant sorting operations, but it concurrently increases unnecessary
rasterization computations. So, during sorting of the proposed approach, GS-TG
groups small tiles (for making large tiles) to share sorting operations across
tiles within each group, significantly reducing redundant computations. During
rasterization, a bitmask assigned to each Gaussian identifies relevant small
tiles, to enable efficient sharing of sorting results. Consequently, GS-TG
enables sorting to be performed as if a large tile size is used by grouping
tiles during the sorting stage, while allowing rasterization to proceed with
the original small tiles by using bitmasks in the rasterization stage. GS-TG is
a lossless method requiring no retraining or fine-tuning and it can be
seamlessly integrated with previous 3D-GS optimization techniques. Experimental
results show that GS-TG achieves an average speed-up of 1.54 times over
state-of-the-art 3D-GS accelerators.

*Mridul Kumar,Yevgeny Rakita*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: Unsupervised machine learning applied to 4D-STEM data reveals nanoscale compositional and structural heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te phase-change materials, identifying four distinct clusters with unique chemical signatures and structural variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase-change materials' functional properties are governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure that are challenging to resolve with conventional techniques, requiring advanced analytical methods to understand their intrinsic heterogeneity.

Method: Used unsupervised machine learning on 4D-STEM data with preprocessing, PCA dimensionality reduction, cluster validation using t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette scoring to identify distinct compositional and structural clusters.

Result: Identified four distinct clusters with unique chemical signatures: Cluster 1 (oxygen and germanium enriched), Cluster 2 (tellurium enriched), Cluster 3 (antimony enriched), and Cluster 4 (germanium enriched), with confirmed structural variations through averaged diffraction patterns.

Conclusion: Clustering analysis provides a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and structural features in phase-change materials, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic heterogeneity that could improve material design and performance.

Abstract: Phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge-Sb-Te alloys are widely used in
non-volatile memory applications due to their rapid and reversible switching
between amorphous and crystalline states. However, their functional properties
are strongly governed by nanoscale variations in composition and structure,
which are challenging to resolve using conventional techniques. Here, we apply
unsupervised machine learning to 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron
microscopy (4D-STEM) data to identify compositional and structural
heterogeneity in Ge-Sb-Te. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction
with principal component analysis (PCA), cluster validation was performed with
t-SNE and UMAP, followed by k-means clustering optimized through silhouette
scoring. Four distinct clusters were identified which were mapped back to the
diffraction data. Elemental intensity histograms revealed chemical signatures
change across clusters, oxygen and germanium enrichment in Cluster 1, tellurium
in Cluster 2, antimony in Cluster 3, and germanium again in Cluster 4.
Furthermore, averaged diffraction patterns from these clusters confirmed
structural variations. Together, these findings demonstrate that clustering
analysis can provide a powerful framework for correlating local chemical and
structural features in PCMs, offering deeper insights into their intrinsic
heterogeneity.

*Laksh Patel,Neel Shanbhag*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenDataCarto is a framework that analyzes training data to identify and mitigate memorization risks in generative models by scoring data difficulty and memorization, enabling targeted data pruning and weighting to reduce leakage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare training examples, which can be exploited by adversaries or artificially inflate benchmark performance, creating security and evaluation concerns.

Method: Proposes Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto) that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and memorization score (frequency of forget events), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting strategies.

Result: Reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40% at just 10% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5%. The framework also provides theoretical guarantees that memorization scores lower-bound classical influence and that down-weighting high-memorization areas decreases generalization gap.

Conclusion: Principled data interventions through the GenDataCarto framework can dramatically mitigate data leakage and memorization risks in generative models with minimal performance cost, offering a data-centric approach to improving model security and generalization.

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare
training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark
performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a
data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score
(early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''),
then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and
up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical
influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting
high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via
uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary
extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing
validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that
principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal
cost to generative performance.

### [404] [Learning to Refine: Self-Refinement of Parallel Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00084)
*Qibin Wang,Pu Zhao,Shaohan Huang,Fangkai Yang,Lu Wang,Furu Wei,Qingwei Lin,Saravan Rajmohan,Dongmei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GSR is a parallel test-time scaling framework where a unified LLM generates candidate responses and then self-refines them into a superior solution, achieving SOTA performance on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods like Best-of-N and majority voting fail when all candidate responses are incorrect, and adding separate selection models increases deployment costs.

Method: A unified model generates candidate responses in parallel, then performs self-refinement using a prompt with the problem and candidates. Uses hybrid training optimizing both direct problem-solving and refinement objectives.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across five mathematical benchmarks. The self-refinement skill is model-agnostic, robust across different model scales, and generalizes to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GSR provides an effective test-time scaling framework that enables LLMs to self-refine candidate responses into superior solutions without requiring additional models, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have
gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority
voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate
responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates
are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also
incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative
Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a
unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then
performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a
prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle
to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design
a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary
objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this
learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across
different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

*Yao Fu,Runchao Li,Xianxuan Long,Haotian Yu,Xiaotian Han,Yu Yin,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural network pruning disrupts LLMs' internal activation features needed for lie detection. Proposed TPLO method preserves lie detection capabilities while pruning by focusing on layers with activation outliers and discriminative features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning LLMs for deployment in low-resource scenarios inadvertently removes critical internal activation features that are essential for lie detection capabilities, creating a need for pruning methods that preserve these features.

Method: TPLO (Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers) emphasizes layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative features simultaneously. Also introduces a prompting rule to enrich TruthfulQA benchmark for better calibration.

Result: Achieves 88% accuracy at 50% sparsity for hallucination detection in pruned LLMs and enhances performance on TruthfulQA benchmark.

Conclusion: TPLO successfully preserves LLMs' original performance while maintaining critical inner state features needed for robust lie detection, addressing the trade-off between model compression and truthfulness assessment capabilities.

Abstract: Neural network pruning has emerged as a promising approach for deploying LLMs
in low-resource scenarios while preserving downstream task performance.
However, for the first time, we reveal that such pruning disrupts LLMs'
internal activation features crucial for lie detection, where probing
classifiers (typically small logistic regression models) trained on these
features assess the truthfulness of LLM-generated statements. This discovery
raises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these
critical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that
naively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently
removes crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite
its reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose
Truthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater
emphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative
features simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while
retaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.
Moreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for
better calibrating LLM pruning. Empirical results show that our approach
improves the hallucination detection for pruned LLMs (achieving 88% accuracy at
50% sparsity) and enhances their performance on TruthfulQA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASC integrates financial and textual data for credit monitoring, achieving 18% higher Silhouette score and identifying clusters like recruitment-focused SMEs with 30% lower default risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous data (numerical financial variables + textual records) present challenges for credit monitoring of SMEs, requiring methods that can effectively integrate both data types.

Method: Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC) that integrates financial and textual similarities through optimized weight parameter and selects eigenvectors using eigenvalue-silhouette optimization approach.

Result: 18% higher Silhouette score than baseline, 51% of low-risk firms include 'social recruitment' term, robust across multiple algorithms with {Δ}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {Δ}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02.

Conclusion: ASC bridges spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, enabling identification of meaningful clusters and supporting more targeted credit interventions.

Abstract: Heterogeneous data, which encompass both numerical financial variables and
textual records, present substantial challenges for credit monitoring. To
address this issue, we propose Advanced Spectral Clustering (ASC), a method
that integrates financial and textual similarities through an optimized weight
parameter and selects eigenvectors using a novel eigenvalue-silhouette
optimization approach. Evaluated on a dataset comprising 1,428 small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), ASC achieves a Silhouette score that is 18%
higher than that of a single-type data baseline method. Furthermore, the
resulting clusters offer actionable insights; for instance, 51% of low-risk
firms are found to include the term 'social recruitment' in their textual
records. The robustness of ASC is confirmed across multiple clustering
algorithms, including k-means, k-medians, and k-medoids, with
{\Delta}Intra/Inter < 0.13 and {\Delta}Silhouette Coefficient < 0.02. By
bridging spectral clustering theory with heterogeneous data applications, ASC
enables the identification of meaningful clusters, such as recruitment-focused
SMEs exhibiting a 30% lower default risk, thereby supporting more targeted and
effective credit interventions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DTRNet is a Transformer variant that dynamically routes only ~10% of tokens through quadratic attention per layer while maintaining full Transformer performance, reducing computation costs significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers apply quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer, making them computationally expensive, especially for long sequences.

Method: DTRNet preserves MLP modules but dynamically routes tokens, with only ~10% going through full attention while others receive lightweight linear updates, decoupling token updates from attention mixing.

Result: DTRNet maintains performance comparable to full Transformers while consistently outperforming routing-based methods like MoD and D-LLM in accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, with efficiency gains scaling with sequence length.

Conclusion: DTRNet provides a simple, efficient, and scalable alternative to standard Transformers by substantially reducing the quadratic computation share while ensuring every token receives explicit updates.

Abstract: Transformers achieve state-of-the-art results across many tasks, but their
uniform application of quadratic self-attention to every token at every layer
makes them computationally expensive. We introduce DTRNet (Dynamic Token
Routing Network), an improved Transformer architecture that allows tokens to
dynamically skip the quadratic cost of cross-token mixing while still receiving
lightweight linear updates. By preserving the MLP module and reducing the
attention cost for most tokens to linear, DTRNet ensures that every token is
explicitly updated while significantly lowering overall computation. This
design offers an efficient and effective alternative to standard dense
attention. Once trained, DTRNet blocks routes only ~10% of tokens through
attention at each layer while maintaining performance comparable to a full
Transformer. It consistently outperforms routing-based layer skipping methods
such as MoD and D-LLM in both accuracy and memory at matched FLOPs, while
routing fewer tokens to full attention. Its efficiency gains, scales with
sequence length, offering significant reduction in FLOPs for long-context
inputs. By decoupling token updates from attention mixing, DTRNet substantially
reduces the quadratic share of computation, providing a simple, efficient, and
scalable alternative to Transformers.

TL;DR: MEPT is a novel prompt tuning method that uses Mixture of Experts architecture to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways for adapting to diverse data distributions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning approaches have rigid parameter spaces that limit their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways for adapting to diverse and evolving data distributions.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT) that integrates multiple prompt experts within a Mixture of Experts architecture to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE with 1.94% mean accuracy improvement while reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. Effectiveness supported by theoretical insights and neural activation pathway visualization.

Conclusion: MEPT provides an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework that enables dynamic activation of neural pathways for flexible adaptation to diverse data distributions.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the
pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process:
pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model
parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target
manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their
rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate
neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse
and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel
approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient
manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture
by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and
non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT
outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on
SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while
significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT
is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and
validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is

TL;DR: DEPO is a data-efficient policy optimization pipeline that combines optimized offline data selection (based on diversity, influence, and difficulty) and online sample filtering (using explorability metrics) to reduce training costs while improving reasoning model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR methods require extensive rollout computation and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. There's a need for more efficient approaches that can achieve similar or better performance with less data.

Method: Combines offline data curation (selecting high-quality samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty) with online RLVR training that uses sample-level explorability metrics to filter low-potential samples and incorporates replay mechanisms for under-explored samples.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across five reasoning benchmarks. Achieves 1.85x speed-up on AIME24 and 1.66x speed-up on AIME25 using only 20% of training data compared to GRPO trained on full dataset.

Conclusion: DEPO provides an effective solution for data-efficient policy optimization, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving performance through intelligent data selection strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have leveraged reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, scaling these methods typically requires extensive rollout computation
and large datasets, leading to high training costs and low data efficiency. To
mitigate this issue, we propose DEPO, a Data-Efficient Policy Optimization
pipeline that combines optimized strategies for both offline and online data
selection. In the offline phase, we curate a high-quality subset of training
samples based on diversity, influence, and appropriate difficulty. During
online RLVR training, we introduce a sample-level explorability metric to
dynamically filter samples with low exploration potential, thereby reducing
substantial rollout computational costs. Furthermore, we incorporate a replay
mechanism for under-explored samples to ensure adequate training, which
enhances the model's final convergence performance. Experiments across five
reasoning benchmarks show that DEPO consistently outperforms existing methods
in both offline and online data selection scenarios. Notably, using only 20% of
the training data, our approach achieves a 1.85 times speed-up on AIME24 and a
1.66 times speed-up on AIME25 compared to GRPO trained on the full dataset.

*Haji Gul,Abdul Ghani Naim,Ajaz Ahmad Bhat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CSG metric fails to scale with classes and correlate with performance in KG link prediction, showing sensitivity to parameters and weak correlation with established metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously evaluate the Cumulative Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric's claims about dataset complexity measurement for knowledge graph link prediction benchmarks.

Method: Experimental assessment of CSG behavior on standard KG benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR) using Monte Carlo sampling points (M) and nearest neighbors (K) parameters, comparing against established performance metrics like mean reciprocal rank.

Result: CSG is highly sensitive to parameter K choice, doesn't scale with number of target classes, and shows weak/no correlation with performance metrics like MRR.

Conclusion: CSG lacks stability and predictive power for KG link prediction, highlighting the need for more robust, classifier-agnostic complexity measures in evaluation.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dataset complexity is crucial for evaluating and
comparing link prediction models for knowledge graphs (KGs). The Cumulative
Spectral Gradient (CSG) metric derived from probabilistic divergence between
classes within a spectral clustering framework was proposed as a dataset
complexity measure that (1) naturally scales with the number of classes and (2)
correlates strongly with downstream classification performance. In this work,
we rigorously assess CSG behavior on standard knowledge graph link prediction
benchmarks a multi class tail prediction task, using two key parameters
governing its computation, M, the number of Monte Carlo sampled points per
class, and K, the number of nearest neighbors in the embedding space. Contrary
to the original claims, we find that (1) CSG is highly sensitive to the choice
of K and therefore does not inherently scale with the number of target classes,
and (2) CSG values exhibit weak or no correlation with established performance
metrics such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Through experiments on FB15k 237,
WN18RR, and other standard datasets, we demonstrate that CSG purported
stability and generalization predictive power break down in link prediction
settings. Our results highlight the need for more robust, classifier agnostic
complexity measures in KG link prediction evaluation.

Motivation: Standard guardian models like LlamaGuard only detect predefined static harm categories, limiting their usefulness across different application domains that require custom policies.

Method: Propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined policies, supporting both fast detection and chain-of-thought reasoning with justification outputs.

Result: Dynamic guardian models match static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while identifying free-form policy violations with accuracy comparable to frontier reasoning models but in a fraction of the time.

Conclusion: Dynamic guardian models provide flexible, user-customizable policy enforcement that maintains accuracy while offering significant speed advantages over traditional approaches.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing
chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian
models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We
propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined
policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not
addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used
for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that
articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match
static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while
identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to
frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generative performance but remain computationally expensive due to their iterative sampling process. Existing training-free acceleration methods are limited by inefficient sampling trajectories.

Method: Proposes A-FloPS framework that reparameterizes sampling trajectories into flow-matching form and augments with adaptive velocity decomposition. Maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible velocities and factorizes velocity field into linear drift and residual components.

Result: Extensive experiments show A-FloPS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency. Achieves substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images with only 5 function evaluations.

Conclusion: A-FloPS is a versatile and effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling that also improves native flow-based generative models, demonstrating its generality.

Abstract: Diffusion models deliver state-of-the-art generative performance across

effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the inefficiency of the
underlying sampling trajectories. We propose A-FloPS (Adaptive Flow Path
Sampler), a principled, training-free framework that reparameterizes the
sampling trajectory of any pre-trained diffusion model into a flow-matching
form and augments it with an adaptive velocity decomposition. The
reparameterization analytically maps diffusion scores to flow-compatible
velocities, yielding integration-friendly trajectories without retraining. The
adaptive mechanism further factorizes the velocity field into a linear drift
term and a residual component whose temporal variation is actively suppressed,
restoring the accuracy benefits of high-order integration even in extremely
low-NFE regimes. Extensive experiments on conditional image generation and
text-to-image synthesis show that A-FloPS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art training-free samplers in both sample quality and efficiency.
Notably, with as few as $5$ function evaluations, A-FloPS achieves
substantially lower FID and generates sharper, more coherent images. The
adaptive mechanism also improves native flow-based generative models,
underscoring its generality. These results position A-FloPS as a versatile and
effective solution for high-quality, low-latency generative modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing methods for class imbalance in optical network failure management, showing post-processing excels in detection while GenAI leads in identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in optical network failure management remains a challenge, with post-processing methods being largely unexplored compared to pre- and in-processing techniques.

Method: Direct comparison of pre-processing (e.g., Random Under-Sampling), in-processing (e.g., Meta-Learning, SMOTE), and post-processing (e.g., Threshold Adjustment) approaches using experimental dataset for failure detection and identification.

Result: Post-processing methods achieved highest F1 improvement (15.3%) in failure detection; GenAI methods delivered best performance gains (24.2%) in failure identification; SMOTE most effective with class overlap and latency constraints; Meta-Learning best without latency constraints.

Conclusion: Different imbalance mitigation strategies excel in different scenarios: post-processing for detection, GenAI for identification, SMOTE for latency-critical overlap cases, and Meta-Learning when latency is not constrained.

Abstract: Machine learning-based failure management in optical networks has gained
significant attention in recent years. However, severe class imbalance, where
normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable
challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied,
post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a
direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class
imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an
experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing
methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score
improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest
inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most
substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows
limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and
latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most
effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results.
In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest
performance with minimal inference time.

*Kaiqi Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEGE is a novel gradient estimation method that replaces STE in quantization-aware training, using progressive mixed-precision replacement and co-optimization to reduce discretization errors and improve low-bit quantization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current STE-based quantization methods overlook discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, leading to accuracy degradation especially at extremely low bit-widths.

Method: Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE) with logarithmic curriculum-driven mixed-precision replacement strategy, formulating QAT as co-optimization of task loss and discretization error.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet across various architectures show PEGE consistently outperforms existing methods and enables low-precision models to match or exceed full-precision accuracy.

Conclusion: PEGE provides a unified and generalizable framework that effectively addresses discretization errors in neural network quantization, achieving superior performance especially at low bit-widths.

Abstract: Neural network quantization aims to reduce the bit-widths of weights and
activations, making it a critical technique for deploying deep neural networks
on resource-constrained hardware. Most Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)
methods rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to address the
non-differentiability of discretization functions by replacing their
derivatives with that of the identity function. While effective, STE overlooks
discretization errors between continuous and quantized values, which can lead
to accuracy degradation -- especially at extremely low bit-widths. In this
paper, we propose Progressive Element-wise Gradient Estimation (PEGE), a simple
yet effective alternative to STE, which can be seamlessly integrated with any
forward propagation methods and improves the quantized model accuracy. PEGE
progressively replaces full-precision weights and activations with their
quantized counterparts via a novel logarithmic curriculum-driven
mixed-precision replacement strategy. Then it formulates QAT as a
co-optimization problem that simultaneously minimizes the task loss for
prediction and the discretization error for quantization, providing a unified
and generalizable framework. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet
across various architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG) demonstrate that PEGE
consistently outperforms existing backpropagation methods and enables
low-precision models to match or even outperform the accuracy of their
full-precision counterparts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMST framework integrates financial and textual data for SME credit evaluation, achieving 88.9% accuracy with improved interpretability over traditional models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional decision trees struggle with high-dimensional data and cannot effectively incorporate textual information, limiting their effectiveness in SME credit evaluation.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) matrix factorization to convert text to numerical matrices, (2) Lasso regression for financial feature selection, (3) multivariate segmentation tree construction using Gini/Entropy with weakest-link pruning.

Result: 88.9% accuracy on 1,428 Chinese SMEs dataset, outperforming baseline decision trees (87.4%), logistic regression, and SVM with better interpretability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: IMST successfully integrates textual and financial data for enhanced SME credit evaluation, demonstrating superior performance, interpretability, and risk detection capabilities compared to traditional models.

Abstract: Traditional decision tree models, which rely exclusively on numerical
variables, often encounter difficulties in handling high-dimensional data and
fail to effectively incorporate textual information. To address these
limitations, we propose the Integrated Multivariate Segmentation Tree (IMST), a
comprehensive framework designed to enhance credit evaluation for small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by integrating financial data with textual
sources. The methodology comprises three core stages: (1) transforming textual
data into numerical matrices through matrix factorization; (2) selecting
salient financial features using Lasso regression; and (3) constructing a
multivariate segmentation tree based on the Gini index or Entropy, with
weakest-link pruning applied to regulate model complexity. Experimental results
derived from a dataset of 1,428 Chinese SMEs demonstrate that IMST achieves an
accuracy of 88.9%, surpassing baseline decision trees (87.4%) as well as
conventional models such as logistic regression and support vector machines
(SVM). Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits superior interpretability and
computational efficiency, featuring a more streamlined architecture and
enhanced risk detection capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AMCR framework addresses copyright risks in text-to-image models through prompt restructuring, attention-based infringement detection, and adaptive risk mitigation during generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based copyright mitigation methods fail to handle subtle infringement cases where seemingly benign prompts still produce copyrighted content, creating legal and ethical challenges for generative AI deployment.

Method: Three-pronged approach: 1) Systematic restructuring of risky prompts into safe forms, 2) Attention-based similarity analysis for partial infringement detection, 3) Adaptive risk mitigation during generation process.

Result: Extensive experiments show AMCR effectively reveals and mitigates latent copyright risks while maintaining image quality, providing practical benchmarks for safer generative model deployment.

Conclusion: AMCR offers a comprehensive solution to copyright challenges in text-to-image generation, addressing limitations of existing methods and enabling safer real-world deployment of generative models.

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive results in text to image tasks,
significantly advancing visual content creation. However, this progress comes
at a cost, as such models rely heavily on large-scale training data and may
unintentionally replicate copyrighted elements, creating serious legal and
ethical challenges for real-world deployment. To address these concerns,
researchers have proposed various strategies to mitigate copyright risks, most
of which are prompt based methods that filter or rewrite user inputs to prevent
explicit infringement. While effective in handling obvious cases, these
approaches often fall short in more subtle situations, where seemingly benign
prompts can still lead to infringing outputs. To address these limitations,
this paper introduces Assessing and Mitigating Copyright Risks (AMCR), a
comprehensive framework which i) builds upon prompt-based strategies by
systematically restructuring risky prompts into safe and non-sensitive forms,
ii) detects partial infringements through attention-based similarity analysis,
and iii) adaptively mitigates risks during generation to reduce copyright
violations without compromising image quality. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of AMCR in revealing and mitigating latent copyright risks,
offering practical insights and benchmarks for the safer deployment of
generative models.

*Jiao Chen,Jiayi He,Fangfang Chen,Zuohong Lv,Jianhua Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FoRo is a forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method that uses CMA-ES optimization and knowledge encoding to prevent catastrophic forgetting in pre-trained models without backpropagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address catastrophic forgetting in continual learning with pre-trained models while avoiding computationally intensive backpropagation and gradient-based optimization for resource-constrained environments.

Method: Lightweight prompt tuning with CMA-ES optimization at input layer, plus knowledge encoding via nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares for incremental classifier updates without revisiting prior data.

Result: Significantly reduces average forgetting, improves accuracy, reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining high knowledge retention across long task sequences.

Conclusion: FoRo provides an efficient and effective continual learning approach suitable for real-world multimedia applications where both efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning
(CL) with pre-trained models. While existing approaches typically freeze the
backbone and fine-tune a small number of parameters to mitigate forgetting,
they still rely on iterative error backpropagation and gradient-based
optimization, which can be computationally intensive and less suitable for
resource-constrained environments. To address this, we propose FoRo, a
forward-only, gradient-free continual learning method. FoRo consists of a
lightweight prompt tuning strategy and a novel knowledge encoding mechanism,
both designed without modifying the pre-trained model. Specifically, prompt
embeddings are inserted at the input layer and optimized using the Covariance
Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), which mitigates distribution
shifts and extracts high-quality task representations. Subsequently,
task-specific knowledge is encoded into a knowledge encoding matrix via
nonlinear random projection and recursive least squares, enabling incremental
updates to the classifier without revisiting prior data. Experiments show that
FoRo significantly reduces average forgetting and improves accuracy. Thanks to
forward-only learning, FoRo reduces memory usage and run time while maintaining
high knowledge retention across long task sequences. These results suggest that
FoRo could serve as a promising direction for exploring continual learning with
pre-trained models, especially in real-world multimedia applications where both
efficiency and effectiveness are critical.

*Lucas Mansilla,Rodrigo Echeveste,Camila Gonzalez,Diego H. Milone,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BM-CL framework uses continual learning principles to mitigate ML biases without performance trade-offs between advantaged and disadvantaged groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bias mitigation techniques cause leveling-down effect, reducing performance for advantaged groups while helping disadvantaged groups. Need methods that improve fairness without sacrificing overall effectiveness.

Method: Reinterprets bias mitigation as domain-incremental continual learning problem. Uses techniques like Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation to adjust to changing fairness conditions while preserving knowledge.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets show effective bias mitigation with minimal loss of original knowledge. Framework successfully balances fairness objectives.

Conclusion: BM-CL bridges fairness and continual learning fields, providing a pathway for developing equitable and effective ML systems without performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Biases in machine learning pose significant challenges, particularly when
models amplify disparities that affect disadvantaged groups. Traditional bias
mitigation techniques often lead to a {\itshape leveling-down effect}, whereby
improving outcomes of disadvantaged groups comes at the expense of reduced
performance for advantaged groups. This study introduces Bias Mitigation
through Continual Learning (BM-CL), a novel framework that leverages the
principles of continual learning to address this trade-off. We postulate that
mitigating bias is conceptually similar to domain-incremental continual
learning, where the model must adjust to changing fairness conditions,
improving outcomes for disadvantaged groups without forgetting the knowledge
that benefits advantaged groups. Drawing inspiration from techniques such as
Learning without Forgetting and Elastic Weight Consolidation, we reinterpret
bias mitigation as a continual learning problem. This perspective allows models
to incrementally balance fairness objectives, enhancing outcomes for
disadvantaged groups while preserving performance for advantaged groups.
Experiments on synthetic and real-world image datasets, characterized by
diverse sources of bias, demonstrate that the proposed framework mitigates
biases while minimizing the loss of original knowledge. Our approach bridges
the fields of fairness and continual learning, offering a promising pathway for
developing machine learning systems that are both equitable and effective.

TL;DR: A novel zero-shot framework using Test-Time Scaling with MLLMs for Visual Place Recognition that achieves 210x computational efficiency gains and superior cross-domain performance without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VPR approaches using Vision Foundation Models and MLLMs suffer from high computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when fine-tuned, creating a need for more efficient and generalizable solutions.

Method: Proposes a zero-shot framework with Test-Time Scaling that leverages MLLMs' vision-language alignment through Guidance-based methods for direct similarity scoring, using structured prompts for length-controllable JSON outputs and Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency for real-time adaptation.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210x computational efficiency gains compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed TTS framework with UASC enables real-time adaptation without additional training costs and demonstrates superior generalization across diverse environments, addressing key limitations of current VPR methods.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) has evolved from handcrafted descriptors to
deep learning approaches, yet significant challenges remain. Current
approaches, including Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), enhance semantic understanding but suffer from high
computational overhead and limited cross-domain transferability when
fine-tuned. To address these limitations, we propose a novel zero-shot
framework employing Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that leverages MLLMs'
vision-language alignment capabilities through Guidance-based methods for
direct similarity scoring. Our approach eliminates two-stage processing by
employing structured prompts that generate length-controllable JSON outputs.
The TTS framework with Uncertainty-Aware Self-Consistency (UASC) enables
real-time adaptation without additional training costs, achieving superior
generalization across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in cross-domain VPR performance with up to 210$\times$
computational efficiency gains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conditional-t^3VAE improves generative fairness on imbalanced datasets by enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes using per-class Student's t-distribution priors, outperforming existing methods particularly under severe class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard VAEs and even t^3VAE with heavy-tailed priors still allocate latent space proportionally to class frequency, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing generative fairness on imbalanced datasets.

Method: Proposes Conditional-t^3VAE with per-class Student's t joint priors over latent and output variables, optimized using closed-form objective derived from γ-power divergence, and uses equal-weight latent mixture of Student's t-distributions for class-balanced generation.

Result: Achieves lower FID scores than t^3VAE and Gaussian-based VAEs on SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, particularly under severe class imbalance. Outperforms conditional Gaussian VAE in per-class F1 evaluations across all highly imbalanced settings.

Conclusion: While Gaussian-based models remain competitive under mild imbalance, Conditional-t^3VAE substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in extreme imbalance regimes by ensuring equitable latent space allocation.

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's
class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing
generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness
via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent
volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this
issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes.
To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class
\mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing
dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form
objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for
class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of
Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA,
Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE
and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In
per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional
Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models
remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach
substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme
regimes.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A framework for accelerating diffusion-based talking head generation using feature caching and parallel denoising to bypass most model layers during inference, plus decoupled foreground attention to focus computations only on dynamic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based talking head models produce high-quality videos but suffer from slow inference speeds that limit practical applications. Existing acceleration methods don't leverage the unique temporal and spatial redundancies in talking head generation.

Method: Proposes Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP) to cache static features and enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents. Also introduces Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to restrict attention computations to dynamic foreground regions and removes reference features in certain layers.

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly improves inference speed while maintaining video quality.

Conclusion: The proposed task-specific framework effectively addresses the inefficiencies in diffusion-based talking head generation by exploiting temporal and spatial redundancies, enabling practical applications through accelerated inference without quality degradation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic
videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications.
Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the
temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this
paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies
through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based
Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass
most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using
cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing
sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to
further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in
talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions.
Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra
speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly
improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

TL;DR: Training-free 3D editing method using native 3D diffusion model's latent space with attention blending and geometry-aware regularization for view-consistent, high-fidelity edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction-based 3D editing lags behind generation quality due to view-inconsistent editing signals from 2D prior methods.

Method: Uses 3D diffusion model's latent space, blends attention maps from generation with source object, applies geometry-aware regularization, spectral modulation in Fourier domain, and 3D refinement.

Result: Outperforms previous 3D editing methods with high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across various shapes and semantic manipulations.

Conclusion: Direct manipulation in 3D diffusion latent space with attention blending and geometric regularization enables superior view-consistent editing compared to 2D-based approaches.

Abstract: Despite the recent success of multi-view diffusion models for
text/image-based 3D asset generation, instruction-based editing of 3D assets
lacks surprisingly far behind the quality of generation models. The main reason
is that recent approaches using 2D priors suffer from view-inconsistent editing
signals. Going beyond 2D prior distillation methods and multi-view editing
strategies, we propose a training-free editing method that operates within the
latent space of a native 3D diffusion model, allowing us to directly manipulate
3D geometry. We guide the edit synthesis by blending 3D attention maps from the
generation with the source object. Coupled with geometry-aware regularization
guidance, a spectral modulation strategy in the Fourier domain and a refinement
step for 3D enhancement, our method outperforms previous 3D editing methods
enabling high-fidelity, precise, and robust edits across a wide range of shapes
and semantic manipulations.

Motivation: Current diffusion-based image editing methods struggle to maintain background fidelity while achieving high-quality edits without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency.

Method: Adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines current latent code with reference latent code from source image, selectively preserving source features in high-similarity regions while generating target content guided by prompts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PIE-Bench dataset with optimal fidelity-editability balance in 8-15 steps, with inversion-free variant halving neural function evaluations and eliminating intermediate variable storage.

Conclusion: LatentEdit provides a plug-and-play solution compatible with UNet and DiT architectures that significantly enhances real-time deployment efficiency without model modifications.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent
years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing
while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory
efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion
framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference
latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source
features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating
target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables
fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal
model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight,
plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based
architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that
our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and
editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps.
Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural
function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate
variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

TL;DR: IntrinsicReal is a domain adaptation framework that bridges the synthetic-to-real gap for intrinsic image decomposition by fine-tuning IntrinsicAnything using a novel dual pseudo-labeling strategy inspired by human evaluation principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for albedo estimation are trained on synthetic datasets but applied to real-world images, creating a significant domain gap that leads to suboptimal generalization performance in real environments.

Method: Proposes IntrinsicReal with a two-phase pipeline using dual pseudo-labeling: 1) absolute confidence threshold on classifier predictions, and 2) relative preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual objects, inspired by human evaluation principles.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed dual pseudo-labeling strategy effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap, demonstrating superior performance in real-world intrinsic image decomposition tasks.

Abstract: Estimating albedo (a.k.a., intrinsic image decomposition) from single RGB
images captured in real-world environments (e.g., the MVImgNet dataset)
presents a significant challenge due to the absence of paired images and their
ground truth albedos. Therefore, while recent methods (e.g., IntrinsicAnything)
have achieved breakthroughs by harnessing powerful diffusion priors, they
remain predominantly trained on large-scale synthetic datasets (e.g.,
Objaverse) and applied directly to real-world RGB images, which ignores the
large domain gap between synthetic and real-world data and leads to suboptimal
generalization performance. In this work, we address this gap by proposing
IntrinsicReal, a novel domain adaptation framework that bridges the
above-mentioned domain gap for real-world intrinsic image decomposition.
Specifically, our IntrinsicReal adapts IntrinsicAnything to the real domain by
fine-tuning it using its high-quality output albedos selected by a novel dual
pseudo-labeling strategy: i) pseudo-labeling with an absolute confidence
threshold on classifier predictions, and ii) pseudo-labeling using the relative
preference ranking of classifier predictions for individual input objects. This
strategy is inspired by human evaluation, where identifying the highest-quality
outputs is straightforward, but absolute scores become less reliable for
sub-optimal cases. In these situations, relative comparisons of outputs become
more accurate. To implement this, we propose a novel two-phase pipeline that
sequentially applies these pseudo-labeling techniques to effectively adapt
IntrinsicAnything to the real domain. Experimental results show that our
IntrinsicReal significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art results for albedo estimation on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: RealMat is a diffusion-based material generator that combines synthetic data training with reinforcement learning to bridge the realism gap in material generation, using real-world material photos and natural lighting to enhance visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing material generation methods suffer from either using synthetic data that creates visual gaps with real-world materials, or relying on limited small datasets of real flash photographs that lack scale and diversity.

Method: Fine-tune Stable Diffusion XL with synthetic material maps in 2x2 grids, then further refine through reinforcement learning with a realism reward function based on a large-scale dataset of realistic material images under natural lighting.

Result: The approach increases generated materials' realism compared to the base model and related work, successfully bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world material appearance.

Conclusion: RealMat demonstrates that combining synthetic data training with reinforcement learning using real-world material priors can effectively generate high-quality, realistic materials for 3D content creation.

Abstract: Generative models for high-quality materials are particularly desirable to
make 3D content authoring more accessible. However, the majority of material
generation methods are trained on synthetic data. Synthetic data provides
precise supervision for material maps, which is convenient but also tends to
create a significant visual gap with real-world materials. Alternatively,
recent work used a small dataset of real flash photographs to guarantee
realism, however such data is limited in scale and diversity. To address these
limitations, we propose RealMat, a diffusion-based material generator that
leverages realistic priors, including a text-to-image model and a dataset of
realistic material photos under natural lighting. In RealMat, we first finetune
a pretrained Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) with synthetic material maps arranged
in $2 \times 2$ grids. This way, our model inherits some realism of SDXL while
learning the data distribution of the synthetic material grids. Still, this
creates a realism gap, with some generated materials appearing synthetic. We
propose to further finetune our model through reinforcement learning (RL),
encouraging the generation of realistic materials. We develop a realism reward
function for any material image under natural lighting, by collecting a
large-scale dataset of realistic material images. We show that this approach
increases generated materials' realism compared to our base model and related
work.

TL;DR: A novel Transformer architecture for mesh analysis that learns Hodge Laplacian operators directly through multi-head attention, eliminating costly eigenvalue decompositions while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional graph/mesh Transformers rely on spectral features requiring expensive eigenvalue decomposition operations for positional embeddings, which is computationally inefficient.

Method: Proposes a deep learning layer inspired by Discrete Exterior Calculus that uses multi-head attention to approximate Hodge matrices and learn discrete operators acting on mesh vertices, edges, and faces.

Result: Achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks while being computationally efficient and eliminating the need for eigenvalue decomposition or complex preprocessing.

Conclusion: The approach provides a direct learning framework that is both effective and efficient for mesh analysis tasks, overcoming computational bottlenecks of traditional spectral methods.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes
for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily
utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based
methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional
embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,
e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then
concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach
inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in
Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and
exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust
the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the
multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$,
$\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act
on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a
computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in
mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning
framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition
operations or complex preprocessing operations.

*Mohit Mendiratta,Mayur Deshmukh,Kartik Teotia,Vladislav Golyanik,Adam Kortylewski,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: GRMM is the first full-head Gaussian 3D morphable model that enhances traditional 3DMMs with residual geometry and appearance components for high-frequency details like wrinkles and hairline variations, achieving real-time rendering at 75 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PCA-based 3DMMs lack resolution and photorealism, while neural volumetric methods are too slow for interactive use. Existing Gaussian Splatting models still rely on mesh-based 3DMM priors, limiting fine-grained geometry and full-head coverage.

Method: GRMM augments base 3DMM with residual geometry and appearance components using coarse decoders for mesh deformations, fine decoders for per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN for image refinement. Uses EXPRESS-50 dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities for training.

Result: GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression accuracy for monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression transfer while maintaining 75 FPS real-time performance.

Conclusion: GRMM successfully bridges the gap between high-quality rendering and real-time performance in 3D facial modeling, providing disentangled control over identity and expression with enhanced photorealism through residual components.

Abstract: 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) enable controllable facial geometry and
expression editing for reconstruction, animation, and AR/VR, but traditional
PCA-based mesh models are limited in resolution, detail, and photorealism.
Neural volumetric methods improve realism but remain too slow for interactive
use. Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,
high-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for
expression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,
expressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head
Gaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry
and appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency
details such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM
provides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters
(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals
that capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's
capacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders
represent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised
images for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.
To learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first
dataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust
disentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across
monocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression
transfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression
accuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual rebar tying is repetitive and ergonomically risky, while existing robotic solutions struggle with accurate pose estimation in congested rebar nodes and require extensive training data.

Method: Geometry-based perception (DBSCAN clustering, feature extraction, PCA) for rebar segmentation and node identification, combined with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) for motion planning trained on only 5-10 demonstrations.

Result: High success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying across various rebar configurations (single-layer, multi-layer, cluttered), with significant reduction in data requirements compared to conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach demonstrates robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-node tying, highlighting the potential of diffusion-driven planning to enhance construction automation while improving safety and labor efficiency.

Abstract: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete
construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk.
Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the
tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in
congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and
motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with
Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust
multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module
utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature
extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars,
identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking,
even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on
Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate
sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying
efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including
single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high
success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with
conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual
parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable
multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result
underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to
enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and
labor efficiency.

*Thomas Jantos,Stephan Weiss,Jan Steinbrener*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Extends DL-based 6D pose predictors with aleatoric uncertainty estimation using additional MLPs, enabling probabilistic state estimation with dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty for robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for probabilistic state estimators in robotics that rely on deep learning-based pose predictions, as fixed covariance approaches underperform compared to dynamically inferred uncertainty.

Method: Adds two multi-layer perceptrons detached from translational and rotational parts of existing DL pose predictors to infer aleatoric uncertainty, allowing efficient training while freezing pre-trained models. Uses inferred pose and uncertainty in EKF.

Result: Minimal computational overhead enables deployment on edge devices while improving object-relative state estimation performance compared to fixed-covariance approaches, validated on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides efficient aleatoric uncertainty inference for DL-based pose predictors, enhancing probabilistic state estimation in robotics applications without significant computational cost.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has become essential in various robotics applications due
to excelling at processing raw sensory data to extract task specific
information from semantic objects. For example, vision-based object-relative
navigation relies on a DL-based 6D object pose predictor to provide the
relative pose between the object and the robot as measurements to the robot's
state estimator. Accurately knowing the uncertainty inherent in such Deep
Neural Network (DNN) based measurements is essential for probabilistic state
estimators subsequently guiding the robot's tasks. Thus, in this letter, we
show that we can extend any existing DL-based object-relative pose predictor
for aleatoric uncertainty inference simply by including two multi-layer
perceptrons detached from the translational and rotational part of the DL
predictor. This allows for efficient training while freezing the existing
pre-trained predictor. We then use the inferred 6D pose and its uncertainty as
a measurement and corresponding noise covariance matrix in an extended Kalman
filter (EKF). Our approach induces minimal computational overhead such that the
state estimator can be deployed on edge devices while benefiting from the
dynamically inferred measurement uncertainty. This increases the performance of
the object-relative state estimation task compared to a fix-covariance
approach. We conduct evaluations on synthetic data and real-world data to
underline the benefits of aleatoric uncertainty inference for the
object-relative state estimation task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior articulation estimation methods fail in realistic unconstrained environments, while humans easily infer articulation by watching object manipulation. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Combines deep point tracking with factor graph optimization to estimate articulated part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos under dynamic camera motion and partial observability.

Result: Superior performance compared to classical and learning-based baselines on the Arti4D dataset, which is the first ego-centric in-the-wild dataset for articulated object interactions.

Conclusion: ArtiPoint provides robust articulation estimation in realistic scenarios, and the Arti4D dataset enables future research in this domain.

Abstract: Understanding the 3D motion of articulated objects is essential in robotic
scene understanding, mobile manipulation, and motion planning. Prior methods
for articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,
assuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various
object states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.
In contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others
manipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel
estimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic
camera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with
a factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated
part trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To
foster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first
ego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions
at a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera
poses. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based
baselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D. We make code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action models in autonomous driving lack interpretability, coherence in decision processes, and plausibility of action sequences, which need to be addressed for reliable autonomous systems.

Method: Proposes a novel CoT dataset (nuScenesR²-6K) for supervised fine-tuning with four-step logical chains and self-reflection validation, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization with physics-grounded rewards incorporating spatial alignment, vehicle dynamics, and temporal smoothness.

Result: Extensive evaluation on nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity.

Conclusion: AutoDrive-R² successfully enhances reasoning and self-reflection capabilities in autonomous driving systems through integrated CoT processing and RL with physics-aware rewards, achieving superior performance and generalization.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in autonomous driving systems have
recently demonstrated transformative potential by integrating multimodal
perception with decision-making capabilities. However, the interpretability and
coherence of the decision process and the plausibility of action sequences
remain largely underexplored. To address these issues, we propose
AutoDrive-R$^2$, a novel VLA framework that enhances both reasoning and
self-reflection capabilities of autonomous driving systems through
chain-of-thought (CoT) processing and reinforcement learning (RL).
Specifically, we first propose an innovative CoT dataset named nuScenesR$^2$-6K
for supervised fine-tuning, which effectively builds cognitive bridges between
input information and output trajectories through a four-step logical chain
with self-reflection for validation. Moreover, to maximize both reasoning and
self-reflection during the RL stage, we further employ the Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm within a physics-grounded reward framework
that incorporates spatial alignment, vehicle dynamic, and temporal smoothness
criteria to ensure reliable and realistic trajectory planning. Extensive
evaluation results across both nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization capacity of our proposed
method.

TL;DR: CDMs improve depth camera accuracy for robotic manipulation by denoising depth signals using simulated training data, enabling sim-to-real generalization without real-world fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotic manipulation relies on 2D visual observations which suffer from poor generalization, while humans use 3D geometric information. Depth cameras could provide similar 3D perception but are limited by noise and inaccuracy.

Method: Propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) that take RGB images and raw depth signals as input to output denoised metric depth. Develop neural data engine generating high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling depth camera noise patterns.

Result: CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, bridging sim-to-real gap. Policies trained on raw simulated depth generalize seamlessly to real robots on challenging tasks with articulated, reflective, and slender objects with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: The approach enables effective utilization of simulation data and 3D information for robot policies, demonstrating successful sim-to-real transfer without real-world fine-tuning.

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D
color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In
contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such
as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.
Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth
cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual
capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation
is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to
various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as
a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth
signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,
we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from
simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that
CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively
bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments
demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,
without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes
seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving
articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance
degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing
simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher
resolutions. We investigated two strategies for tuning the accuracy-computation
performance trade-off when implementing the adaptive resolution selection,
validated against the Camelyon16 dataset of biomedical images. Our results
demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data
required for analysis by up to 2.65x, while preserving the accuracy in
identifying relevant sections on a single computer. To ensure democratization
of gigapixel image analysis, we evaluated the potential to use mainstream
computers to perform the computation by exploiting the parallelism potential of
the approach. Using a simulator, we estimated the best data distribution and
load balancing algorithm according to the number of workers. The selected
algorithms were implemented and highlighted the same conclusions in a
real-world setting. Analysis time is reduced from more than an hour to a few
minutes using 12 modest workers, offering a practical solution for efficient
large-scale image analysis.
