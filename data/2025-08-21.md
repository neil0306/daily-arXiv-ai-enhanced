### [1] [From Image Captioning to Visual Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14045)
*Admitos Passadakis,Yingjin Song,Albert Gatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper treats Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image Captioning, using a two-stage approach: first generating captions from images, then transforming them into coherent narratives, which improves story quality and training efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance between story grounding in image sequences and narrative coherence in Visual Storytelling, addressing the challenge of creating stories that are both visually grounded and narratively compelling.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Vision-to-language model for image captioning, 2) Language-to-language methods to transform captions into coherent narratives. Also introduces a new metric called 'ideality' to measure distance from oracle models.

Result: Integration of captioning and storytelling under unified framework improves story quality, accelerates training time, and enhances reusability/reproducibility. The ideality metric effectively simulates human-likeness in visual storytelling.

Conclusion: Treating Visual Storytelling as an extension of Image Captioning with a two-stage approach provides better balance between visual grounding and narrative coherence, while the proposed ideality metric offers a useful tool for evaluating storytelling quality.

Abstract: Visual Storytelling is a challenging multimodal task between Vision &
Language, where the purpose is to generate a story for a stream of images. Its
difficulty lies on the fact that the story should be both grounded to the image
sequence but also narrative and coherent. The aim of this work is to balance
between these aspects, by treating Visual Storytelling as a superset of Image
Captioning, an approach quite different compared to most of prior relevant
studies. This means that we firstly employ a vision-to-language model for
obtaining captions of the input images, and then, these captions are
transformed into coherent narratives using language-to-language methods. Our
multifarious evaluation shows that integrating captioning and storytelling
under a unified framework, has a positive impact on the quality of the produced
stories. In addition, compared to numerous previous studies, this approach
accelerates training time and makes our framework readily reusable and
reproducible by anyone interested. Lastly, we propose a new metric/tool, named
ideality, that can be used to simulate how far some results are from an oracle
model, and we apply it to emulate human-likeness in visual storytelling.

*Kezia Oketch,John P. Lalor,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First taxonomy-guided evaluation of Swahili NLP using health-related psychometric data from Kenyan speakers, revealing sociolinguistic influences on model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in sociolinguistic diversity evaluation for African languages, particularly Swahili, by examining how cultural and linguistic variations affect NLP models.

Method: Collected 2,170 free-text responses from Kenyan speakers on health tasks, developed a structured taxonomy to analyze sociolinguistic features (tribal influences, urban vernacular, code-mixing, loanwords), and evaluated various pre-trained and instruction-tuned language models.

Result: Data exhibited significant sociolinguistic variation including tribal influences and code-mixing. Model prediction errors were systematically analyzed through the taxonomy lens, revealing how sociolinguistic factors shape performance.

Conclusion: The study advances culturally grounded evaluation frameworks and demonstrates the critical role of sociolinguistic variation in understanding and improving NLP model performance for African languages.

Abstract: We introduce the first taxonomy-guided evaluation of Swahili NLP, addressing
gaps in sociolinguistic diversity. Drawing on health-related psychometric
tasks, we collect a dataset of 2,170 free-text responses from Kenyan speakers.
The data exhibits tribal influences, urban vernacular, code-mixing, and
loanwords. We develop a structured taxonomy and use it as a lens for examining
model prediction errors across pre-trained and instruction-tuned language
models. Our findings advance culturally grounded evaluation frameworks and
highlight the role of sociolinguistic variation in shaping model performance.

*Yiran Rex Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes English-Chinese news differences in adverbial functional chunk ordering using LLM-annotated corpora, finding systematic preferences and pragmatic flexibility in word order.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore differences in constituent order between English and Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with adverbial roles, and analyze their positional preferences and distribution patterns.

Method: Analysis based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language Model (LLM), examining functional chunks with adverbial roles and their positional distribution.

Result: (1) English news prefers linear narrative with core information first and post-positioned functional chunks, while Chinese prefers background-first presentation with pre-positioned chunks; (2) In SVO structure, Chinese shows stronger pre-positioning tendency while English post-positioning is milder; (3) Both languages show high flexibility in co-occurring function blocks with order adjustments driven by information and pragmatic purposes.

Conclusion: Word order exhibits both systematic preference and dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of English-Chinese information structure.

Abstract: Based on comparable English-Chinese news corpora annotated by Large Language
Model (LLM), this paper attempts to explore the differences in constituent
order of English-Chinese news from the perspective of functional chunks with
adverbial roles, and analyze their typical positional preferences and
distribution patterns. It is found that: (1) English news prefers linear
narrative of core information first, and functional chunks are mostly
post-positioned, while Chinese news prefers overall presentation mode of
background first, and functional chunks are often pre-positioned; (2) In SVO
structure, both English and Chinese news show differences in the distribution
of functional chunks, but the tendency of Chinese pre-positioning is more
significant, while that of English post-positioning is relatively mild; (3)
When function blocks are co-occurring, both English and Chinese news show high
flexibility, and the order adjustment is driven by information and pragmatic
purposes. The study reveals that word order has both systematic preference and
dynamic adaptability, providing new empirical support for contrastive study of
English-Chinese information structure.

### [5] [Confidence Estimation for Text-to-SQL in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14056)
*Sepideh Entezari Maleki,Mohammadreza Pourreza,Davood Rafiei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Study of confidence estimation methods for LLM-generated SQL queries without gold answers, comparing black-box and white-box approaches with execution-based grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess reliability of text-to-SQL model outputs when access to model weights/gradients is constrained, enabling better trust in LLM-generated SQL queries.

Method: Evaluated both black-box (consistency-based) and white-box (SQL-syntax-aware logit interpretation) confidence estimation strategies on cross-domain benchmarks, with execution-based query grounding.

Result: Consistency-based methods performed best for black-box models; SQL-syntax-aware approaches worked best for white-box settings; execution grounding improved both approaches.

Conclusion: Effective confidence estimation for text-to-SQL is achievable through appropriate black-box/white-box methods, with execution-based grounding providing valuable supplementary signals for reliability assessment.

Abstract: Confidence estimation for text-to-SQL aims to assess the reliability of
model-generated SQL queries without having access to gold answers. We study
this problem in the context of large language models (LLMs), where access to
model weights and gradients is often constrained. We explore both black-box and
white-box confidence estimation strategies, evaluating their effectiveness on
cross-domain text-to-SQL benchmarks. Our evaluation highlights the superior
performance of consistency-based methods among black-box models and the
advantage of SQL-syntax-aware approaches for interpreting LLM logits in
white-box settings. Furthermore, we show that execution-based grounding of
queries provides a valuable supplementary signal, improving the effectiveness
of both approaches.

### [6] [Assessing and Mitigating Data Memorization Risks in Fine-Tuned Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14062)
*Badrinath Ramakrishnan,Akshaya Balaji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs significantly increases data memorization risks (60-75% leakage), but a novel multi-layered privacy framework can reduce leakage to 0% while preserving 94.7% model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' tendency to memorize training data during fine-tuning poses serious privacy risks, especially when handling sensitive information, requiring effective protection mechanisms.

Method: Proposes four complementary privacy protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering, evaluated through controlled experiments on GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2 models.

Result: Fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage from 0-5% baseline to 60-75% (64.2% average increase), but the proposed framework reduces leakage to 0% while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

Conclusion: The multi-layered privacy protection framework effectively mitigates data memorization risks in fine-tuned LLMs without significantly compromising model performance, providing a comprehensive solution for privacy-preserving fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks, but their tendency to memorize
training data poses significant privacy risks, particularly during fine-tuning
processes. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of data
memorization in fine-tuned LLMs and introduces a novel multi-layered privacy
protection framework. Through controlled experiments on modern LLM
architectures including GPT-2, Phi-3, and Gemma-2, we demonstrate that
fine-tuning with repeated sensitive data increases privacy leakage rates from
baseline levels of 0-5% to 60-75%, representing a 64.2% average increase across
tested models. We propose and rigorously evaluate four complementary privacy
protection methods: semantic data deduplication, differential privacy during
generation, entropy-based filtering, and pattern-based content filtering. Our
experimental results show that these techniques can reduce data leakage to 0%
while maintaining 94.7% of original model utility.

### [7] [Punctuation and Predicates in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14067)
*Sonakshi Chauhan,Maheep Chaudhary,Koby Choy,Samuel Nellessen,Nandi Schoots*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how punctuation tokens serve as attention sinks and memory aids in LLMs, revealing model-specific differences in their necessity and sufficiency across GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma. The study also examines whether LLMs form early static summaries of input components and finds that different reasoning rules (conditional statements vs universal quantification) are processed differently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand where information is collected and propagated in LLMs, particularly focusing on the computational importance of punctuation tokens that previous work identified as attention sinks and memory aids, and to explore how different input components and reasoning rules are processed.

Method: Used intervention-based techniques including interchange intervention and layer-swapping experiments to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2, DeepSeek, and Gemma. Extended analysis to different input components and reasoning rules.

Result: Found stark model-specific differences: punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers for GPT-2, but this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Discovered that conditional statements (if-then) and universal quantification (for all) are processed very differently by LLMs.

Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs, with implications for interpretability, showing that different models handle punctuation and reasoning rules in distinct ways across layers.

Abstract: In this paper we explore where information is collected and how it is
propagated throughout layers in large language models (LLMs). We begin by
examining the surprising computational importance of punctuation tokens which
previous work has identified as attention sinks and memory aids. Using
intervention-based techniques, we evaluate the necessity and sufficiency (for
preserving model performance) of punctuation tokens across layers in GPT-2,
DeepSeek, and Gemma. Our results show stark model-specific differences: for
GPT-2, punctuation is both necessary and sufficient in multiple layers, while
this holds far less in DeepSeek and not at all in Gemma. Extending beyond
punctuation, we ask whether LLMs process different components of input (e.g.,
subjects, adjectives, punctuation, full sentences) by forming early static
summaries reused across the network, or if the model remains sensitive to
changes in these components across layers. Extending beyond punctuation, we
investigate whether different reasoning rules are processed differently by
LLMs. In particular, through interchange intervention and layer-swapping
experiments, we find that conditional statements (if, then), and universal
quantification (for all) are processed very differently. Our findings offer new
insight into the internal mechanisms of punctuation usage and reasoning in LLMs
and have implications for interpretability.

### [8] [DLLMQuant: Quantizing Diffusion-based Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14090)
*Chen Xu,Dawei Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DLLMQuant is a post-training quantization framework specifically designed for diffusion-based LLMs that addresses quantization challenges through temporal-mask adaptive sampling, interaction-aware activation quantization, and certainty-guided quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs suffer from severe accuracy degradation when using standard PTQ methods due to their unique mechanisms like dynamic masking and iterative generation, which clash with quantization approaches designed for autoregressive models.

Method: Proposes DLLMQuant with three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling to capture distributions across timesteps, 2) Interaction-Aware Activation Quantization using bidirectional attention signals, and 3) Certainty-Guided Quantization that integrates mask status and token scores for error compensation.

Result: The framework achieves significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency, overcoming the 16% accuracy drop experienced by standard methods like AWQ on W4A4 quantization.

Conclusion: DLLMQuant successfully addresses the unique quantization challenges of diffusion-based LLMs through specialized techniques that account for their temporal, masking, and attention characteristics, enabling effective compression without performance degradation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (DLLMs) have shown promise for
non-autoregressive text generation, but their deployment is constrained by
large model sizes and heavy computational costs. Post-training quantization
(PTQ), a widely used method for compressing and accelerating Large Language
Models (LLMs), suffers from severe accuracy degradation and reduced
generalization performance when directly applied to DLLMs (e.g., AWQ suffers a
16% accuracy drop on LLADA under W4A4). This paper explores how DLLMs' key
mechanisms - dynamic masking, iterative generation, bidirectional attention -
clash with quantization. We identify three core issues: 1) Iterative generation
and dynamic masking ratios lead to distinct token distributions across decoding
steps, which are not adequately captured by existing PTQ calibration methods;
2) Quantization errors are accumulated and amplified progressively during
iteration in DLLMs, causing quantized models to perform worse as decoding steps
progress; 3) Unmasked tokens stabilize while masked remain probabilistic,
making overall feature distribution incompatible with existing PTQ methods. To
address these issues, we propose DLLMQuant, a PTQ framework tailored for DLLMs,
which incorporates three novel techniques: 1) Temporal-Mask Adaptive Sampling
(TMAS), a calibration method that accounts for both time and mask factors, with
the capacity to capture distributions across timesteps. 2) Interaction-Aware
Activation Quantization (IA-AQ), which utilizes bidirectional attention's
interaction signals to dynamically allocate quantization resources. 3)
Certainty-Guided Quantization (CGQ), which integrates mask status and token
scores as key weighting criteria into error compensation, making weight
quantization more suitable for DLLMs. Experiments show that DLLMQuant achieves
significant performance gains while enhancing efficiency.

### [9] [MMReview: A Multidisciplinary and Multimodal Benchmark for LLM-Based Peer Review Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14146)
*Xian Gao,Jiacheng Ruan,Zongyun Zhang,Jingsheng Gao,Ting Liu,Yuzhuo Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMReview is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs and MLLMs in peer review tasks across multiple disciplines with multimodal content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based review systems lack a unified evaluation benchmark to assess comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, especially for multimodal content like figures and tables.

Method: Created MMReview benchmark with 240 papers across 17 research domains in four academic disciplines, featuring multimodal content and expert-written reviews. Designed 13 tasks in four categories: step-wise review generation, outcome formulation, human preference alignment, and robustness to adversarial manipulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and 5 closed-source models demonstrate the benchmark's thoroughness and effectiveness in evaluating model performance.

Conclusion: MMReview provides a standardized foundation for developing automated peer review systems and represents a critical step forward in evaluating AI-assisted academic review capabilities.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of academic publications, peer review has become an
essential yet time-consuming responsibility within the research community.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have increasingly been adopted to assist in the
generation of review comments; however, current LLM-based review tasks lack a
unified evaluation benchmark to rigorously assess the models' ability to
produce comprehensive, accurate, and human-aligned assessments, particularly in
scenarios involving multimodal content such as figures and tables. To address
this gap, we propose \textbf{MMReview}, a comprehensive benchmark that spans
multiple disciplines and modalities. MMReview includes multimodal content and
expert-written review comments for 240 papers across 17 research domains within
four major academic disciplines: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Sciences,
Engineering Sciences, and Social Sciences. We design a total of 13 tasks
grouped into four core categories, aimed at evaluating the performance of LLMs
and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) in step-wise review generation, outcome
formulation, alignment with human preferences, and robustness to adversarial
input manipulation. Extensive experiments conducted on 16 open-source models
and 5 advanced closed-source models demonstrate the thoroughness of the
benchmark. We envision MMReview as a critical step toward establishing a
standardized foundation for the development of automated peer review systems.

### [10] [DPad: Efficient Diffusion Language Models with Suffix Dropout](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14148)
*Xinhua Chen,Sitao Huang,Cong Guo,Chiyue Wei,Yintao He,Jianyi Zhang,Hai "Hellen" Li,Yiran Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPad is a training-free method that speeds up diffusion-based LLMs by using a sliding window and distance-decay dropout to reduce redundant attention computations on distant suffix tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based LLMs suffer from high computational overhead because they predict all future suffix tokens at each decoding step while only keeping a small fraction, making them inefficient for long-sequence generation.

Method: DPad uses two strategies: (1) a sliding window that maintains a fixed-length suffix window, and (2) distance-decay dropout that deterministically removes distant suffix tokens before attention computation. This is training-free and compatible with existing optimizations.

Result: DPad achieves up to 61.4× speedup over vanilla diffusion-based LLMs while maintaining comparable accuracy across multiple benchmarks on LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models.

Conclusion: DPad provides an efficient and scalable solution for long-sequence inference in diffusion-based LLMs with minimal code changes, demonstrating significant speed improvements without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) parallelize text generation by
framing decoding as a denoising process, but suffer from high computational
overhead since they predict all future suffix tokens at each step while
retaining only a small fraction. We propose Diffusion Scratchpad (DPad), a
training-free method that restricts attention to a small set of nearby suffix
tokens, preserving fidelity while eliminating redundancy. DPad integrates two
strategies: (i) a sliding window, which maintains a fixed-length suffix window,
and (ii) distance-decay dropout, which deterministically removes distant suffix
tokens before attention computation. This simple design is compatible with
existing optimizations such as prefix caching and can be implemented with only
a few lines of code. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks on
LLaDA-1.5 and Dream models demonstrate that DPad delivers up to
$\mathbf{61.4\times}$ speedup over vanilla dLLMs while maintaining comparable
accuracy, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable long-sequence
inference. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crys-Chen/DPad.

### [11] [Comparing energy consumption and accuracy in text classification inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14170)
*Johannes Zschache,Tilman Hartwig*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes energy efficiency in LLM inference for text classification, finding that the most accurate models can also be energy-efficient, while larger LLMs consume more energy with lower accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of attention to energy consumption during LLM inference phase compared to training, and concerns about sustainability in NLP applications.

Method: Systematic evaluation of trade-offs between model accuracy and energy consumption across various model architectures and hardware configurations for text classification inference.

Result: Best-performing models can be energy-efficient; larger LLMs consume significantly more energy with lower accuracy; energy consumption varies widely (<mWh to >kWh) based on model type/size/hardware; strong correlation between energy consumption and runtime.

Conclusion: Execution time can serve as practical proxy for energy usage; findings provide actionable insights for sustainable AI development and balancing performance with resource efficiency.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks raises concerns about energy efficiency and
sustainability. While prior research has largely focused on energy consumption
during model training, the inference phase has received comparatively less
attention. This study systematically evaluates the trade-offs between model
accuracy and energy consumption in text classification inference across various
model architectures and hardware configurations. Our empirical analysis shows
that the best-performing model in terms of accuracy can also be
energy-efficient, while larger LLMs tend to consume significantly more energy
with lower classification accuracy. We observe substantial variability in
inference energy consumption ($<$mWh to $>$kWh), influenced by model type,
model size, and hardware specifications. Additionally, we find a strong
correlation between inference energy consumption and model runtime, indicating
that execution time can serve as a practical proxy for energy usage in settings
where direct measurement is not feasible. These findings have implications for
sustainable AI development, providing actionable insights for researchers,
industry practitioners, and policymakers seeking to balance performance and
resource efficiency in NLP applications.

*Krishna Garg,Firoz Shaikh,Sambaran Bandyopadhyay,Cornelia Caragea*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SciIG, a new task for evaluating LLMs' ability to generate research paper introductions from titles, abstracts, and related works. They test 5 state-of-the-art models and find LLaMA-4 Maverick performs best, with three-shot prompting being most effective.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become writing assistants, generating high-quality research paper introductions remains challenging yet essential. There's a need to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in academic writing assistance.

Method: Created SciIG task and curated datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR 2025 papers. Evaluated 5 models (open-source and closed-source) across multiple dimensions using automated metrics and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations with different prompting strategies.

Result: LLaMA-4 Maverick showed superior performance on most metrics, especially semantic similarity and faithfulness. Three-shot prompting consistently outperformed fewer-shot approaches across all models.

Conclusion: The findings provide practical insights for developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. All code and datasets will be publicly released for reproducibility.

Abstract: As researchers increasingly adopt LLMs as writing assistants, generating
high-quality research paper introductions remains both challenging and
essential. We introduce Scientific Introduction Generation (SciIG), a task that
evaluates LLMs' ability to produce coherent introductions from titles,
abstracts, and related works. Curating new datasets from NAACL 2025 and ICLR
2025 papers, we assess five state-of-the-art models, including both open-source
(DeepSeek-v3, Gemma-3-12B, LLaMA 4-Maverick, MistralAI Small 3.1) and
closed-source GPT-4o systems, across multiple dimensions: lexical overlap,
semantic similarity, content coverage, faithfulness, consistency, citation
correctness, and narrative quality. Our comprehensive framework combines
automated metrics with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations. Results demonstrate LLaMA-4
Maverick's superior performance on most metrics, particularly in semantic
similarity and faithfulness. Moreover, three-shot prompting consistently
outperforms fewer-shot approaches. These findings provide practical insights
into developing effective research writing assistants and set realistic
expectations for LLM-assisted academic writing. To foster reproducibility and
future research, we will publicly release all code and datasets.

### [13] [Disentangling concept semantics via multilingual averaging in Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14275)
*Cliff O'Reilly,Ernesto Jimenez-Ruiz,Tillman Weyde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Averaging concept activations across multiple languages in LLMs helps isolate pure semantic relationships between concepts, improving alignment with formal ontology mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address LLMs' shortcomings by connecting them with formal knowledge representation and isolating concept semantics from syntactic and language-specific information.

Method: Use Sparse Autoencoders to extract concept activations from Gemma 2B LLM for ontology classes in English, French, and Chinese, then average activations across languages to derive conceptual representations.

Result: Conceptual averages across languages align better with true ontology class relationships than single-language activations alone.

Conclusion: Cross-language averaging of concept activations provides a new technique for more accurate mechanistic interpretation of LLM internal states and semantic relationships.

Abstract: Connecting LLMs with formal knowledge representation and reasoning is a
promising approach to address their shortcomings. Embeddings and sparse
autoencoders are widely used to represent textual content, but the semantics
are entangled with syntactic and language-specific information. We propose a
method that isolates concept semantics in Large Langue Models by averaging
concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French
and Chinese and then pass these texts as prompts to the Gemma 2B LLM. Using the
open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRILE is the first open benchmark for Romanian language testing with 1,151 multiple-choice questions from high-stakes exams, revealing that while Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves 83% accuracy, most open-weight models perform below 65% and nearly half of their explanations contain factual errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the pedagogical value of LLMs for low-resource languages like Romanian, where their educational capabilities remain unclear despite NLP advancements.

Method: Created GRILE benchmark with questions from Romanian national exams, tested 7 multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs on answer selection accuracy and explanation quality, conducted expert review of explanations, and performed detailed error analysis.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro reached 83% accuracy, but most open-weight models stayed below 65%. 48% of explanations contained factual or pedagogical flaws. Systematic weaknesses identified in morphology and DOOM3 orthographic norms application.

Conclusion: The findings expose significant challenges for educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a valuable test-bed for controllable explanation generation and evaluation, with all data and tools released to support future research.

Abstract: LLMs (Large language models) have revolutionized NLP (Natural Language
Processing), yet their pedagogical value for low-resource languages remains
unclear. We present GRILE (Grammar Romanian Inference and Language
Explanations) , the first open benchmark of 1,151 multiple-choice questions
harvested from Romanian high-stakes exams (National Evaluation, Baccalaureate,
university admissions). GRILE enables us to probe two complementary abilities
of seven state-of-the-art multilingual and Romanian-specific LLMs: (i)
selecting the correct answer, and (ii) producing linguistically accurate
explanations. While Gemini 2.5 Pro reaches 83% accuracy, most open-weight
models stay below 65%, and 48% of their explanations contain factual or
pedagogical flaws according to expert review. A detailed error analysis
pinpoints systematic weaknesses in morphology and in applying the latest DOOM3
orthographic norms. All data, code and a public web demo are released to
catalyze future research. Our findings expose open challenges for trustworthy
educational NLP in low-resource settings and establish GRILE as a new test-bed
for controllable explanation generation and evaluation.

Motivation: Existing subword tokenization methods like BPE and WordPiece struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure, leading to inefficient and less interpretable tokenization.

Method: A hybrid approach using phonological normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers to phonologically variant affixes and altered root forms, integrates BPE for out-of-vocabulary coverage, and uses special tokens for whitespace and case management.

Result: Achieved the highest Turkish Token Percentage (90.29%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8%) on the TR-MMLU benchmark. Outperformed tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT in producing more linguistically meaningful and coherent tokens.

Conclusion: The framework provides a language-independent solution for more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems, demonstrated effectively on Turkish but adaptable to other morphologically complex languages.

Abstract: Tokenization plays a pivotal role in natural language processing (NLP),
shaping how text is segmented and interpreted by language models. While subword
methods such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and WordPiece have been effective,
they often struggle with morphologically rich and agglutinative languages
because they rely on frequency rather than linguistic structure. We introduce a
hybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis
with statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological
normalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances
morpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers
to phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms
(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic
integrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an
UPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is
integrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological
coherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish
Token Percentage (90.29\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\%). Comparisons with
tokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and
coherent tokens. Although demonstrated on Turkish, the approach is
language-independent and adaptable to other languages, offering a practical
path toward more interpretable and effective multilingual NLP systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a unified system that can effectively handle both morphological and syntactic analyses following the novel UD annotation scheme for the UniDive 2025 shared task.

Method: Uses a shared XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction.

Result: Achieved best overall performance with average MSLAS score of 78.7%, LAS of 80.1%, and Feats F1 of 90.3% across nine typologically diverse languages.

Conclusion: The model demonstrates strong performance but struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and nominal features, while ablation studies confirm the importance of gold tokenization and content word identification.

Abstract: We present a joint multitask model for the UniDive 2025 Morpho-Syntactic
Parsing shared task, where systems predict both morphological and syntactic
analyses following novel UD annotation scheme. Our system uses a shared
XLM-RoBERTa encoder with three specialized decoders for content word
identification, dependency parsing, and morphosyntactic feature prediction. Our
model achieves the best overall performance on the shared task's leaderboard
covering nine typologically diverse languages, with an average MSLAS score of
78.7 percent, LAS of 80.1 percent, and Feats F1 of 90.3 percent. Our ablation
studies show that matching the task's gold tokenization and content word
identification are crucial to model performance. Error analysis reveals that
our model struggles with core grammatical cases (particularly Nom-Acc) and
nominal features across languages.

*Aman Goel,Daniel Schwartz,Yanjun Qi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finch-Zk is a black-box framework that detects and mitigates LLM hallucinations using cross-model consistency checking without external knowledge, achieving significant improvements in detection and mitigation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are prone to generating plausible but factually inaccurate content (hallucinations), which limits their reliability in production systems. Current approaches often require external knowledge sources, making them impractical for deployment.

Method: Uses fine-grained cross-model consistency checking by comparing responses from diverse models on semantically-equivalent prompts, plus targeted mitigation that applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate content.

Result: Improves hallucination detection F1 scores by 6-39% on FELM dataset. For mitigation, achieves 7-8 percentage points improvement in answer accuracy on GPQA-diamond dataset with state-of-the-art models like Llama 4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet.

Conclusion: Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready solution for enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems through effective hallucination detection and mitigation without external knowledge requirements.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations--generating
content that appears plausible but contains factual inaccuracies. We present
Finch-Zk, a black-box framework that leverages FINe-grained Cross-model
consistency to detect and mitigate Hallucinations in LLM outputs without
requiring external knowledge sources. Finch-Zk introduces two key innovations:
1) a cross-model consistency checking strategy that reveals fine-grained
inaccuracies by comparing responses generated by diverse models from
semantically-equivalent prompts, and 2) a targeted mitigation technique that
applies precise corrections to problematic segments while preserving accurate
content. Experiments on the FELM dataset show Finch-Zk improves hallucination
detection F1 scores by 6-39\% compared to existing approaches. For mitigation,
Finch-Zk achieves 7-8 absolute percentage points improvement in answer accuracy
on the GPQA-diamond dataset when applied to state-of-the-art models like Llama
4 Maverick and Claude 4 Sonnet. Extensive evaluation across multiple models
demonstrates that Finch-Zk provides a practical, deployment-ready safeguard for
enhancing factual reliability in production LLM systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SurveyGen-I is an automatic survey generation framework that uses coarse-to-fine retrieval, adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation to create coherent, comprehensive scientific surveys with better citation coverage than previous LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches struggle with maintaining coherence across long multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive citation coverage, which are critical for effective scientific survey papers.

Method: Combines coarse-to-fine retrieval (survey-level then subsection-level), adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation with a mechanism that stores previously written content to ensure coherence across subsections.

Result: Experiments across four scientific domains show SurveyGen-I consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and citation coverage.

Conclusion: SurveyGen-I successfully addresses the limitations of previous LLM-based survey generation methods by ensuring coherence and comprehensive citation coverage through its innovative memory-guided generation approach.

Abstract: Survey papers play a critical role in scientific communication by
consolidating progress across a field. Recent advances in Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer a promising solution by automating key steps in the
survey-generation pipeline, such as retrieval, structuring, and summarization.
However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with maintaining
coherence across long, multi-section surveys and providing comprehensive
citation coverage. To address these limitations, we introduce SurveyGen-I, an
automatic survey generation framework that combines coarse-to-fine retrieval,
adaptive planning, and memory-guided generation. SurveyGen-I first performs
survey-level retrieval to construct the initial outline and writing plan, and
then dynamically refines both during generation through a memory mechanism that
stores previously written content and terminology, ensuring coherence across
subsections. When the system detects insufficient context, it triggers
fine-grained subsection-level retrieval. During generation, SurveyGen-I
leverages this memory mechanism to maintain coherence across subsections.
Experiments across four scientific domains demonstrate that SurveyGen-I
consistently outperforms previous works in content quality, consistency, and
citation coverage.

TL;DR: BAR (Behavior-Aligned Retriever) uses contrastive learning to retrieve consistent demonstrations that help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions, reducing erroneous function calls while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for tool-augmented LLMs suffer from high training overhead and inconsistent demonstration samples that misguide function invocation behavior, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs.

Method: Constructed a corpus with different function-calling behaviors, trained a behavior-aligned retriever using contrastive learning with customized positive/negative pairs and dual-negative contrastive loss to ensure robust retrieval of behaviorally consistent examples.

Result: Significantly reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution.

Conclusion: BAR provides a practical approach to improve tool-using decisions in LLMs by retrieving behaviorally consistent demonstrations, addressing the limitations of existing fine-tuning and demonstration-based methods.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) leverage external functions to
extend their capabilities, but inaccurate function calls can lead to
inefficiencies and increased costs.Existing methods address this challenge by
fine-tuning LLMs or using demonstration-based prompting, yet they often suffer
from high training overhead and fail to account for inconsistent demonstration
samples, which misguide the model's invocation behavior. In this paper, we
trained a behavior-aligned retriever (BAR), which provides behaviorally
consistent demonstrations to help LLMs make more accurate tool-using decisions.
To train the BAR, we construct a corpus including different function-calling
behaviors, i.e., calling or non-calling.We use the contrastive learning
framework to train the BAR with customized positive/negative pairs and a
dual-negative contrastive loss, ensuring robust retrieval of behaviorally
consistent examples.Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces erroneous function calls while maintaining high task performance,
offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for tool-augmented LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with zero-shot assessment of Chinese reading comprehension difficulty aligned with students' cognitive abilities, but show improvement with in-context examples, revealing both emerging capabilities and systematic biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in understanding LLMs' ability to evaluate reading material difficulty in alignment with students' cognitive development stages, particularly for Chinese language education and the Zone of Proximal Development principle.

Method: Introduces ZPD-SCA benchmark annotated by top 0.15% Special Grade teachers, testing LLMs in zero-shot and in-context learning scenarios across different student age groups and reading genres.

Result: LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot scenarios (some below random guessing), improve substantially with in-context examples (nearly double accuracy), but show systematic directional biases and genre-dependent performance variations.

Conclusion: LLMs possess emerging but limited abilities for educational alignment assessment, with ZPD-SCA providing a foundation for evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in educational
applications, yet their capacity to accurately assess the cognitive alignment
of reading materials with students' developmental stages remains insufficiently
explored. This gap is particularly critical given the foundational educational
principle of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which emphasizes the need
to match learning resources with Students' Cognitive Abilities (SCA). Despite
the importance of this alignment, there is a notable absence of comprehensive
studies investigating LLMs' ability to evaluate reading comprehension
difficulty across different student age groups, especially in the context of
Chinese language education. To fill this gap, we introduce ZPD-SCA, a novel
benchmark specifically designed to assess stage-level Chinese reading
comprehension difficulty. The benchmark is annotated by 60 Special Grade
teachers, a group that represents the top 0.15% of all in-service teachers
nationwide. Experimental results reveal that LLMs perform poorly in zero-shot
learning scenarios, with Qwen-max and GLM even falling below the probability of
random guessing. When provided with in-context examples, LLMs performance
improves substantially, with some models achieving nearly double the accuracy
of their zero-shot baselines. These results reveal that LLMs possess emerging
abilities to assess reading difficulty, while also exposing limitations in
their current training for educationally aligned judgment. Notably, even the
best-performing models display systematic directional biases, suggesting
difficulties in accurately aligning material difficulty with SCA. Furthermore,
significant variations in model performance across different genres underscore
the complexity of task. We envision that ZPD-SCA can provide a foundation for
evaluating and improving LLMs in cognitively aligned educational applications.

TL;DR: A novel prompt-based calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game that uses feedback-driven prompting and performance summaries to dynamically improve LLM confidence calibration without additional supervision or parameter updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are deployed in decision-critical domains, ensuring their confidence estimates faithfully correspond to actual correctness becomes essential. Existing calibration methods require additional supervision or parameter updates.

Method: Establishes a structured interaction loop where LLMs receive feedback based on alignment of predicted confidence with correctness, using feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance.

Result: Extensive experiments across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in evaluation metrics for LLM calibration.

Conclusion: Game-based prompting shows potential as an effective strategy for LLM calibration, providing a novel framework that improves model calibration dynamically without additional supervision or parameter updates.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
decision-critical domains, it becomes essential to ensure that their confidence
estimates faithfully correspond to their actual correctness. Existing
calibration methods have primarily focused on post-hoc adjustments or auxiliary
model training; however, many of these approaches necessitate additional
supervision or parameter updates. In this work, we propose a novel prompt-based
calibration framework inspired by the Credence Calibration Game. Our method
establishes a structured interaction loop wherein LLMs receive feedback based
on the alignment of their predicted confidence with correctness. Through
feedback-driven prompting and natural language summaries of prior performance,
our framework dynamically improves model calibration. Extensive experiments
across models and game configurations demonstrate consistent improvements in
evaluation metrics. Our results highlight the potential of game-based prompting
as an effective strategy for LLM calibration. Code and data are available at

### [23] [DEPTH: Hallucination-Free Relation Extraction via Dependency-Aware Sentence Simplification and Two-tiered Hierarchical Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14391)
*Yupei Yang,Fan Feng,Lin Yang,Wanxi Deng,Lin Qu,Biwei Huang,Shikui Tu,Lei Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEPTH framework reduces relation extraction hallucinations in LLMs through dependency-aware simplification and hierarchical refinement, achieving 17.2% F1 improvement and 7.0% hallucination rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with reliably determining relation existence in complex sentences, leading to spurious predictions and noisy knowledge graphs that compromise downstream reliability.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) Grounding module extracts relations using shortest dependency paths to create minimal relational contexts, (2) Refinement module aggregates local predictions and revises them holistically. Includes causality-driven reward model for robust RLHF fine-tuning.

Result: Achieves 17.2% average F1 score improvement over SOTA baselines and reduces average hallucination rate to 7.0% across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: DEPTH effectively addresses LLM hallucinations in relation extraction through syntactic simplification and hierarchical refinement, significantly improving reliability and performance.

Abstract: Relation extraction enables the construction of structured knowledge for many
downstream applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown great
promise in this domain, most existing methods concentrate on relation
classification, which predicts the semantic relation type between a related
entity pair. However, we observe that LLMs often struggle to reliably determine
whether a relation exists, especially in cases involving complex sentence
structures or intricate semantics, which leads to spurious predictions. Such
hallucinations can introduce noisy edges in knowledge graphs, compromising the
integrity of structured knowledge and downstream reliability. To address these
challenges, we propose DEPTH, a framework that integrates Dependency-aware
sEntence simPlification and Two-tiered Hierarchical refinement into the
relation extraction pipeline. Given a sentence and its candidate entity pairs,
DEPTH operates in two stages: (1) the Grounding module extracts relations for
each pair by leveraging their shortest dependency path, distilling the sentence
into a minimal yet coherent relational context that reduces syntactic noise
while preserving key semantics; (2) the Refinement module aggregates all local
predictions and revises them based on a holistic understanding of the sentence,
correcting omissions and inconsistencies. We further introduce a
causality-driven reward model that mitigates reward hacking by disentangling
spurious correlations, enabling robust fine-tuning via reinforcement learning
with human feedback. Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that DEPTH
reduces the average hallucination rate to 7.0\% while achieving a 17.2\%
improvement in average F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Yinghan Zhou,Weifeng Zhu,Juan Wen,Wanli Peng,Zhengxian Wu,Yiming Xue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with self-recognition in individual text evaluation but perform well in pairwise comparison. The paper identifies Implicit Territorial Awareness and proposes Cognitive Surgery to improve individual text authorship identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models show self-recognition capability in pairwise text comparison but fail in individual text evaluation, with unclear underlying causes for this performance gap.

Method: Proposes Cognitive Surgery (CoSur) framework with four modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship discrimination, and cognitive editing to awaken LLMs' latent self-recognition ability.

Result: Experimental results show CoSur improves three different LLMs' performance in individual presentation paradigm, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01% respectively.

Conclusion: The study successfully identifies Implicit Territorial Awareness as the cause of LLMs' self-recognition failure and demonstrates that Cognitive Surgery can effectively awaken this latent capability for improved authorship identification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess a degree of
self-recognition capability-the ability to identify whether a given text was
generated by themselves. Prior work has demonstrated that this capability is
reliably expressed under the Pair Presentation Paradigm (PPP), where the model
is presented with two texts and asked to choose which one it authored. However,
performance deteriorates sharply under the Individual Presentation Paradigm
(IPP), where the model is given a single text to judge authorship. Although
this phenomenon has been observed, its underlying causes have not been
systematically analyzed. In this paper, we first replicate existing findings to
confirm that LLMs struggle to distinguish self- from other-generated text under
IPP. We then investigate the reasons for this failure and attribute it to a
phenomenon we term Implicit Territorial Awareness (ITA)-the model's latent
ability to distinguish self- and other-texts in representational space, which
remains unexpressed in its output behavior. To awaken the ITA of LLMs, we
propose Cognitive Surgery (CoSur), a novel framework comprising four main
modules: representation extraction, territory construction, authorship
discrimination and cognitive editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed method improves the performance of three different LLMs in the IPP
scenario, achieving average accuracies of 83.25%, 66.19%, and 88.01%,
respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning framework that injects knowledge graph information into language models using graph neural networks and fusion mechanisms to improve entity-level semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address missing reasoning chains and insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in LLMs when handling tasks requiring structured knowledge.

Method: Knowledge graph injection framework using GNNs to encode entities/relations, fusion mechanism to combine KG embeddings with contextual representations, gating mechanism to balance linguistic vs structural knowledge, and joint loss function for task performance and structural alignment.

Result: Significantly enhances model's ability to represent complex semantic units, shows better semantic consistency and contextual logic in structural reasoning and entity extraction tasks across entity recognition, QA, and language generation.

Conclusion: The proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework effectively integrates structured knowledge into language models, improving entity prediction accuracy and semantic reasoning while maintaining robustness through systematic sensitivity validation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problems of missing reasoning chains and
insufficient entity-level semantic understanding in large language models when
dealing with tasks that require structured knowledge. It proposes a fine-tuning
algorithm framework based on knowledge graph injection. The method builds on
pretrained language models and introduces structured graph information for
auxiliary learning. A graph neural network is used to encode entities and their
relations, constructing a graph-based semantic representation. A fusion
mechanism is then designed to jointly model the knowledge graph embeddings with
the contextual representations from the language model. To enhance the
robustness of knowledge integration, a gating mechanism is introduced to
dynamically balance the contributions of linguistic semantics and structural
knowledge. This effectively mitigates conflicts between different
representational spaces. During training, a joint loss function is constructed
to account for both task performance and structural alignment objectives. This
helps improve the accuracy of entity prediction and semantic reasoning. The
study also includes a series of systematic sensitivity experiments. It
evaluates the effects of learning rate, graph coverage, and structural
perturbations on model performance. The results further validate the
effectiveness and stability of the proposed method across tasks such as entity
recognition, question answering, and language generation. Experimental findings
show that the proposed structure-aware fine-tuning framework significantly
enhances the model's ability to represent complex semantic units. It
demonstrates better semantic consistency and contextual logic modeling in
scenarios involving structural reasoning and entity extraction.

Motivation: To increase throughput for reasoning workloads while maintaining high accuracy, addressing the need for efficient generation of long thinking traces in reasoning tasks.

Method: Replaced majority of self-attention layers with Mamba-2 layers in Transformer architecture, pre-trained 12B model on 20T tokens using FP8 training, then compressed and distilled using Minitron strategy for efficient inference on 128k tokens.

Result: Achieves on-par or better accuracy than similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B) while delivering up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning scenarios with 8k input and 16k output tokens.

Conclusion: The hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture successfully balances accuracy and throughput, making it suitable for efficient reasoning workloads, with models and datasets released publicly.

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model
designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models.
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the
majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture
are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when
generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model
(Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe.
After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to
compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to
128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision).
Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that
Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks
while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like
8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2,
Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with

the WMT25 General Machine Translation Shared Task. Our submission focuses on
Japanese-related translation tasks, aiming to explore a generalizable paradigm
for extending large language models (LLMs) to other languages. This paradigm
encompasses aspects such as data construction methods and reward model design.
The ultimate goal is to enable large language model systems to achieve
exceptional performance in low-resource or less commonly spoken languages.

### [28] [Reasoning is about giving reasons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14488)
*Krunal Shah,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new intermediate representation called RLS (Representation of Logical Structure) to capture the logical atoms and rules in natural language arguments, enabling more interpretable and extensible reasoning capabilities beyond simple rule chaining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer approaches for logical reasoning suffer from poor interpretability and limited extensibility - they can chain rules but cannot articulate the underlying reasons, support abduction, or identify contradictions.

Method: The authors introduce RLS as an intermediate representation that captures the logical structure of natural language arguments, including logical atoms and the rules incorporating them. This makes reasoning deterministic and computable.

Result: The approach successfully identifies and extracts logical structures from three popular reasoning datasets with high accuracy, supporting explanation generation and significantly extending reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The RLS representation enables all forms of reasoning that depend on logical structure, including arbitrary reasoning depths, on-the-fly mistake rectification, and interactive discussion about arguments, overcoming limitations of current rule-chaining approaches.

Abstract: Convincing someone of the truth value of a premise requires understanding and
articulating the core logical structure of the argument which proves or
disproves the premise. Understanding the logical structure of an argument
refers to understanding the underlying "reasons" which make up the proof or
disproof of the premise - as a function of the "logical atoms" in the argument.
While it has been shown that transformers can "chain" rules to derive simple
arguments, the challenge of articulating the "reasons" remains. Not only do
current approaches to chaining rules suffer in terms of their interpretability,
they are also quite constrained in their ability to accommodate extensions to
theoretically equivalent reasoning tasks - a model trained to chain rules
cannot support abduction or identify contradictions. In this work we suggest
addressing these shortcomings by identifying an intermediate representation
(which we call the Representation of the Logical Structure (RLS) of the
argument) that possesses an understanding of the logical structure of a natural
language argument - the logical atoms in the argument and the rules
incorporating them. Given the logical structure, reasoning is deterministic and
easy to compute. Therefore, our approach supports all forms of reasoning that
depend on the logical structure of the natural language argument, including
arbitrary depths of reasoning, on-the-fly mistake rectification and interactive
discussion with respect to an argument. We show that we can identify and
extract the logical structure of natural language arguments in three popular
reasoning datasets with high accuracies, thus supporting explanation generation
and extending the reasoning capabilities significantly.

*Maja J. Hjuler,Harald V. Skat-Rørdam,Line H. Clemmensen,Sneha Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EmoTale is a new Danish-English emotional speech corpus that addresses the lack of emotional datasets for smaller languages like Danish, achieving 64.1% UAR with self-supervised speech models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a significant lack of functional emotional speech datasets for smaller languages like Danish, with only one existing database (DES from 1997) available, creating a need for modern, comprehensive emotional speech resources.

Method: Created EmoTale corpus with Danish and English emotional speech recordings and emotion annotations. Used self-supervised speech model embeddings and openSMILE feature extractor to develop speech emotion recognition models with leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation.

Result: Self-supervised speech model embeddings outperformed hand-crafted features. Best model achieved 64.1% unweighted average recall on EmoTale corpus, which is comparable to performance on the existing DES dataset.

Conclusion: EmoTale provides a valid and functional emotional speech corpus for Danish that performs comparably to existing datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-supervised learning approaches for speech emotion recognition in under-resourced languages.

Abstract: While multiple emotional speech corpora exist for commonly spoken languages,
there is a lack of functional datasets for smaller (spoken) languages, such as
Danish. To our knowledge, Danish Emotional Speech (DES), published in 1997, is
the only other database of Danish emotional speech. We present EmoTale; a
corpus comprising Danish and English speech recordings with their associated
enacted emotion annotations. We demonstrate the validity of the dataset by
investigating and presenting its predictive power using speech emotion
recognition (SER) models. We develop SER models for EmoTale and the reference
datasets using self-supervised speech model (SSLM) embeddings and the openSMILE
feature extractor. We find the embeddings superior to the hand-crafted
features. The best model achieves an unweighted average recall (UAR) of 64.1%
on the EmoTale corpus using leave-one-speaker-out cross-validation, comparable
to the performance on DES.

### [30] [Towards Skeletal and Signer Noise Reduction in Sign Language Production via Quaternion-Based Pose Encoding and Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14574)
*Guilhem Fauré,Mostafa Sadeghi,Sam Bigeard,Slim Ouni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposed two enhancements to Progressive Transformers for sign language production: quaternion-based pose encoding with geodesic loss for better angular movements, and contrastive loss to structure embeddings by semantic similarity. Achieved 16% improvement in keypoint accuracy and 6% reduction in bone angle error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high intra-class variability in sign language production caused by signer morphology and stylistic variations in training data to improve model robustness.

Method: Enhanced Progressive Transformers with: 1) quaternion-based pose encoding and geodesic loss for angular joint movements, 2) contrastive loss using gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity to structure decoder embeddings by semantic similarity.

Result: On Phoenix14T dataset: contrastive loss alone achieved 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint; combined with quaternion encoding achieved 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error compared to baseline.

Conclusion: Incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive objectives benefits Transformer-based sign language production models by improving robustness to anatomical and stylistic variations.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in neural sign language production (SLP) lies in
the high intra-class variability of signs, arising from signer morphology and
stylistic variety in the training data. To improve robustness to such
variations, we propose two enhancements to the standard Progressive
Transformers (PT) architecture (Saunders et al., 2020). First, we encode poses
using bone rotations in quaternion space and train with a geodesic loss to
improve the accuracy and clarity of angular joint movements. Second, we
introduce a contrastive loss to structure decoder embeddings by semantic
similarity, using either gloss overlap or SBERT-based sentence similarity,
aiming to filter out anatomical and stylistic features that do not convey
relevant semantic information. On the Phoenix14T dataset, the contrastive loss
alone yields a 16% improvement in Probability of Correct Keypoint over the PT
baseline. When combined with quaternion-based pose encoding, the model achieves
a 6% reduction in Mean Bone Angle Error. These results point to the benefit of
incorporating skeletal structure modeling and semantically guided contrastive
objectives on sign pose representations into the training of Transformer-based
SLP models.

TL;DR: New machine translation resources for Southern Uzbek including datasets, fine-tuned NLLB-200 model, and Arabic-script post-processing method


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Southern Uzbek has 5 million speakers but is underrepresented in NLP despite significant differences from Northern Uzbek in phonology, lexicon, and orthography

Method: Created 997-sentence FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from multiple sources, fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy), and developed post-processing for Arabic-script half-space characters

Result: Developed comprehensive machine translation resources and improved handling of morphological boundaries through post-processing

Conclusion: All datasets, models, and tools released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other low-resource languages

Abstract: Southern Uzbek (uzs) is a Turkic language variety spoken by around 5 million
people in Afghanistan and differs significantly from Northern Uzbek (uzn) in
phonology, lexicon, and orthography. Despite the large number of speakers,
Southern Uzbek is underrepresented in natural language processing. We present
new resources for Southern Uzbek machine translation, including a 997-sentence
FLORES+ dev set, 39,994 parallel sentences from dictionary, literary, and web
sources, and a fine-tuned NLLB-200 model (lutfiy). We also propose a
post-processing method for restoring Arabic-script half-space characters, which
improves handling of morphological boundaries. All datasets, models, and tools
are released publicly to support future work on Southern Uzbek and other
low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel continuous sentiment scoring method using concept vector projection for literary texts, outperforming traditional tools and better matching human ratings across languages and genres.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sentiment analysis for literary texts faces challenges with figurative language and ambiguity. Traditional dictionary tools underperform, especially for low-resource languages, while transformer models provide only coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis.

Method: Continuous sentiment scoring based on concept vector projection, trained on multilingual literary data to capture nuanced sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods.

Result: Outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings. Enables more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous sentiment scoring method effectively addresses the unique challenges of literary sentiment analysis, providing superior performance and enabling finer-grained analysis compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis is widely used to quantify sentiment in text, but its
application to literary texts poses unique challenges due to figurative
language, stylistic ambiguity, as well as sentiment evocation strategies.
Traditional dictionary-based tools often underperform, especially for
low-resource languages, and transformer models, while promising, typically
output coarse categorical labels that limit fine-grained analysis. We introduce
a novel continuous sentiment scoring method based on concept vector projection,
trained on multilingual literary data, which more effectively captures nuanced
sentiment expressions across genres, languages, and historical periods. Our
approach outperforms existing tools on English and Danish texts, producing
sentiment scores whose distribution closely matches human ratings, enabling
more accurate analysis and sentiment arc modeling in literature.

TL;DR: The paper identifies Softmax as a limitation in LLMs' in-context learning for quantifier tasks and linear functions, and proposes SSA as a superior alternative that improves performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent studies have revealed limitations in LLMs' remarkable in-context learning ability, particularly on tasks involving first-order quantifiers (all, some) and linear functions.

Method: Proposed scaled signed averaging (SSA) as a novel alternative to Softmax in attention mechanisms, and evaluated it on both encoder-only and decoder-only transformer models.

Result: SSA dramatically improves performance on target tasks and matches/exceeds Softmax-based models across various linguistic probing tasks.

Conclusion: SSA is an effective replacement for Softmax that addresses identified limitations in in-context learning capabilities for specific linguistic tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity to learn by
analogy, known as in-context learning (ICL). However, recent studies have
revealed limitations in this ability. In this paper, we examine these
limitations on tasks involving first-order quantifiers such as {\em all} and
{\em some}, as well as on ICL with linear functions. We identify Softmax, the
scoring function in attention mechanism, as a contributing factor to these
constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{scaled signed averaging
(SSA)}, a novel alternative to Softmax. Empirical results show that SSA
dramatically improves performance on our target tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate
both encoder-only and decoder-only transformers models with SSA, demonstrating
that they match or exceed their Softmax-based counterparts across a variety of
linguistic probing tasks.

TL;DR: ShizhenGPT is the first multimodal LLM for Traditional Chinese Medicine that addresses data scarcity and multimodal diagnostic challenges through a comprehensive dataset and achieves superior performance in TCM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have limited application in TCM due to data scarcity and the multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics (looking, listening, smelling, pulse-taking) that conventional LLMs cannot handle.

Method: Created largest TCM dataset (100GB+ text, 200GB+ multimodal data including 1.2M images, 200 hours audio, physiological signals). Pretrained and instruction-tuned ShizhenGPT for deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning.

Result: Outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger proprietary models. Leads in TCM visual understanding among multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across sound, pulse, smell, and vision modalities.

Conclusion: ShizhenGPT paves the way for holistic multimodal perception and diagnosis in TCM, with datasets, models, and code publicly available to inspire further exploration in the field.

Abstract: Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their
potential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored
due to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)
the inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,
listening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond
the scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present
ShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data
scarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text
and 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and
physiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to
achieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect
recent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for
Medicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that
ShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger
proprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among
existing multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities
like sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal
perception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly
available. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation and address limitations of generic tokenizers in preserving recipe structures and precise numerical quantities.

Method: Comparative study using fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) vs GPT-2 small (124M) and LSTM/RNN baselines on RecipeDB 5-cuisine corpus, with custom tokenization adding 23 fraction tokens and structural markers.

Result: Large transformer approach achieved >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over best recurrent baseline and reduced perplexity by 69.8%.

Conclusion: The study provides a foundation for advanced recipe generation research, though challenges remain in factual accuracy, paving way for integrating real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs.

Abstract: We established a rigorous benchmark for text-based recipe generation, a
fundamental task in natural language generation. We present a comprehensive
comparative study contrasting a fine-tuned GPT-2 large (774M) model against the
GPT-2 small (124M) model and traditional LSTM/RNN baselines on the 5-cuisine
corpus from RecipeDB. Our key contribution is a targeted tokenization strategy
that augments the vocabulary with 23 common fraction tokens and custom
structural markers. This approach addresses a critical limitation of generic
tokenizers by preserving essential recipe structures and precise numerical
quantities, thereby enhancing domain specificity. Performance is evaluated
using a comprehensive suite of seven automatic metrics spanning fluency
(BLEU-4, METEOR), coherence (ROUGE-L), semantic relevance (BERTScore), and
diversity. Our experiments show that the large transformer-based approach
yields a >20% relative improvement in BERTScore (F1) (0.92 vs 0.72) over the
best recurrent baseline, while reducing perplexity by 69.8%. We conclude with a
discussion of remaining challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy,
and outline how this foundational study paves the way for integrating
real-world constraints and multi-modal inputs in advanced recipe generation
research.

*Guangzhan Wang,Hongyu Zhang,Beijun Shen,Xiaodong Gu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LMTransplant is a novel text augmentation method that uses LLMs to create diverse content-level variants by transplanting seed text into expanded contexts and regenerating new text, outperforming traditional augmentation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data augmentation methods focus on lexical rephrasing with same semantics, while LLM-based augmentation faces challenges in controlling style/structure and requires complex prompt engineering.

Method: Transplant-then-regenerate paradigm: incorporate seed text into LLM-expanded context, then ask LLM to regenerate variants based on the expanded context while preserving core attributes.

Result: Superior performance over existing text augmentation methods across various tasks, with exceptional scalability as augmented data size grows.

Conclusion: LMTransplant effectively leverages LLM knowledge to create diverse and creative content-level variants while maintaining original text attributes, demonstrating strong performance and scalability.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional
methods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,
which primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large
language models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their "knowledge
emergence" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs
remains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,
we propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.
The core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed
text into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant
based on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more
diverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge
embedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We
evaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its
superior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,
LMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data
grows.

*Samir Abdaljalil,Erchin Serpedin,Khalid Qaraqe,Hasan Kurban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show surprising robustness in code-switched multilingual NLI tasks, with performance sometimes improving rather than degrading when languages are mixed, suggesting translation-induced lexical variation acts as regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment across languages in multilingual contexts, particularly focusing on natural language inference tasks.

Method: Developed a controlled evaluation framework using synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs translated into typologically diverse languages, tested in both monolingual and code-switched conditions with embedding-based similarity validation.

Result: Code-switching does not degrade performance and can even improve it, suggesting translation-induced lexical variation serves as regularization; semantic preservation was validated through embedding analyses.

Conclusion: Current LLMs show both potential and brittleness in cross-lingual reasoning, with code-switching identified as a promising approach for improving multilingual robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in multilingual
contexts, yet their capacity for consistent, logically grounded alignment
across languages remains underexplored. We present a controlled evaluation
framework for multilingual natural language inference (NLI) that generates
synthetic, logic-based premise-hypothesis pairs and translates them into a
typologically diverse set of languages. This design enables precise control
over semantic relations and allows testing in both monolingual and
mixed-language (code-switched) conditions. Surprisingly, code-switching does
not degrade, and can even improve, performance, suggesting that
translation-induced lexical variation may serve as a regularization signal. We
validate semantic preservation through embedding-based similarity analyses and
cross-lingual alignment visualizations, confirming the fidelity of translated
pairs. Our findings expose both the potential and the brittleness of current
LLM cross-lingual reasoning, and identify code-switching as a promising lever
for improving multilingual robustness. Code available at:

TL;DR: TransLLM is a unified framework that combines spatiotemporal modeling with large language models using learnable prompt composition to address diverse urban transportation tasks like traffic forecasting, EV charging prediction, and taxi dispatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches have limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and data-hungry, while large language models struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical reasoning in transportation domains.

Method: Uses a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder with dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph attention networks, integrated with LLMs through structured embeddings. Features instance-level prompt routing via reinforcement learning for dynamic prompt personalization.

Result: Experiments across seven datasets and three tasks show exceptional effectiveness in both supervised and zero-shot settings, delivering competitive performance compared to ten baseline models on regression and planning problems.

Conclusion: TransLLM demonstrates strong generalization and cross-task adaptability, providing a unified foundation framework that successfully bridges spatiotemporal modeling with large language models for urban transportation challenges.

Abstract: Urban transportation systems encounter diverse challenges across multiple
tasks, such as traffic forecasting, electric vehicle (EV) charging demand
prediction, and taxi dispatch. Existing approaches suffer from two key
limitations: small-scale deep learning models are task-specific and
data-hungry, limiting their generalizability across diverse scenarios, while
large language models (LLMs), despite offering flexibility through natural
language interfaces, struggle with structured spatiotemporal data and numerical
reasoning in transportation domains. To address these limitations, we propose
TransLLM, a unified foundation framework that integrates spatiotemporal
modeling with large language models through learnable prompt composition. Our
approach features a lightweight spatiotemporal encoder that captures complex
dependencies via dilated temporal convolutions and dual-adjacency graph
attention networks, seamlessly interfacing with LLMs through structured
embeddings. A novel instance-level prompt routing mechanism, trained via
reinforcement learning, dynamically personalizes prompts based on input
characteristics, moving beyond fixed task-specific templates. The framework
operates by encoding spatiotemporal patterns into contextual representations,
dynamically composing personalized prompts to guide LLM reasoning, and
projecting the resulting representations through specialized output layers to
generate task-specific predictions. Experiments across seven datasets and three
tasks demonstrate the exceptional effectiveness of TransLLM in both supervised
and zero-shot settings. Compared to ten baseline models, it delivers
competitive performance on both regression and planning problems, showing
strong generalization and cross-task adaptability. Our code is available at

TL;DR: RAG approach for EHR analysis matches/exceeds recent notes performance while using drastically fewer tokens than full context methods


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHRs are long, noisy and redundant, posing challenges for clinicians. LLMs struggle with length of clinical notes exceeding context windows.

Method: Proposed three clinical tasks: imaging procedure extraction, antibiotic timeline generation, key diagnosis identification. Tested three state-of-the-art LLMs with varying context using targeted text retrieval (RAG) vs most recent notes.

Result: RAG closely matched or exceeded performance of using recent notes, and approached full context performance while requiring drastically fewer input tokens.

Conclusion: RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach for EHR analysis even as newer models handle longer text.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing
a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language
models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this
unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even
state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages
from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input
tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable
across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2)
generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using
EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs
with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval
or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds
the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using
the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our
results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as
newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text.

TL;DR: Study shows English pivot language effectiveness varies across languages for long chain-of-thought reasoning, with multilingual pretraining narrowing but not eliminating performance gaps, and language-dependent data quality vs scale trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how long chain-of-thought reasoning transfers across different languages and understand when English can serve as an effective pivot language for multilingual reasoning tasks.

Method: Constructed translated versions of English reasoning datasets, fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and systematically studied long CoT generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili.

Result: English pivot effectiveness varies: no benefit for French, improves Japanese/Latvian performance, insufficient for Swahili. Multilingual pretraining narrows but doesn't eliminate gaps. Lightweight fine-tuning improves Swahili by 30%. Data quality vs scale trade-offs are language-dependent.

Conclusion: Results clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages, with translated datasets provided to support equitable multilingual reasoning research.

Abstract: Scaling inference through long chains-of-thought (CoTs) has unlocked
impressive reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), yet the
reasoning process remains almost exclusively English-centric. We construct
translated versions of two popular English reasoning datasets, fine-tune Qwen
2.5 (7B) and Qwen 3 (8B) models, and present a systematic study of long CoT
generation across French, Japanese, Latvian, and Swahili. Our experiments
reveal three key findings. First, the efficacy of using English as a pivot
language varies by language: it provides no benefit for French, improves
performance when used as the reasoning language for Japanese and Latvian, and
proves insufficient for Swahili where both task comprehension and reasoning
remain poor. Second, extensive multilingual pretraining in Qwen 3 narrows but
does not eliminate the cross-lingual performance gap. A lightweight fine-tune
using only 1k traces still improves performance by over 30\% in Swahili. Third,
data quality versus scale trade-offs are language dependent: small, carefully
curated datasets suffice for English and French, whereas larger but noisier
corpora prove more effective for Swahili and Latvian. Together, these results
clarify when and why long CoTs transfer across languages and provide translated
datasets to foster equitable multilingual reasoning research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLM agents struggle with medical domain challenges due to lack of dense medical knowledge and absence of specialized retrieval tools for medical contexts.

Method: Two core innovations: 1) data synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs to generate complex multi-hop QA pairs, 2) integration of custom private medical retrieval engine with general-purpose tools. Training combines supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning.

Result: Generated 2100+ diverse trajectories across 12 medical specialties. MedResearcher-R1-32B model achieves new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks.

Conclusion: Strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and training data construction enable smaller open-source models to outperform larger proprietary systems in specialized medical domains.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
impressive capabilities spanning multiple domains, exemplified by deep research
systems that demonstrate superior performance on complex information-seeking
and synthesis tasks. While general-purpose deep research agents have shown
impressive capabilities, they struggle significantly with medical domain
challenges, as evidenced by leading proprietary systems achieving limited
accuracy on complex medical benchmarks. The key limitations are: (1) the model
lacks sufficient dense medical knowledge for clinical reasoning, and (2) the
framework is constrained by the absence of specialized retrieval tools tailored
for medical contexts.We present a medical deep research agent that addresses
these challenges through two core innovations. First, we develop a novel data
synthesis framework using medical knowledge graphs, extracting the longest
chains from subgraphs around rare medical entities to generate complex
multi-hop question-answer pairs. Second, we integrate a custom-built private
medical retrieval engine alongside general-purpose tools, enabling accurate
medical information synthesis. Our approach generates 2100+ diverse
trajectories across 12 medical specialties, each averaging 4.2 tool
interactions.Through a two-stage training paradigm combining supervised
fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning with composite rewards, our
MedResearcher-R1-32B model demonstrates exceptional performance, establishing
new state-of-the-art results on medical benchmarks while maintaining
competitive performance on general deep research tasks. Our work demonstrates
that strategic domain-specific innovations in architecture, tool design, and
training data construction can enable smaller open-source models to outperform

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion LLMs show promise as alternative to autoregressive LLMs but face deployment challenges on edge devices due to massive parameter scale and high resource demands. PTQ techniques widely used for AR LLMs remain unexplored for dLLMs.

Method: Systematic study identifying activation outliers with abnormally large values, implementing state-of-the-art PTQ methods, and comprehensive evaluation across four dimensions: bit-width, quantization method, task category, and model type.

Result: Analysis reveals presence of activation outliers that dominate dynamic range and pose key challenge to low-bit quantization by making it difficult to preserve precision for majority of values.

Conclusion: Provides practical insights into quantization behavior of dLLMs under different configurations, offering foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and experimental setups will be released to support community.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have introduced a
promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for natural language
generation tasks, leveraging full attention and denoising-based decoding
strategies. However, the deployment of these models on edge devices remains
challenging due to their massive parameter scale and high resource demands.
While post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a widely adopted
technique for compressing AR LLMs, its applicability to dLLMs remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study on quantizing
diffusion-based language models. We begin by identifying the presence of
activation outliers, characterized by abnormally large activation values that
dominate the dynamic range. These outliers pose a key challenge to low-bit
quantization, as they make it difficult to preserve precision for the majority
of values. More importantly, we implement state-of-the-art PTQ methods and
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across multiple task types and model
variants. Our analysis is structured along four key dimensions: bit-width,
quantization method, task category, and model type. Through this
multi-perspective evaluation, we offer practical insights into the quantization
behavior of dLLMs under different configurations. We hope our findings provide
a foundation for future research in efficient dLLM deployment. All codes and
experimental setups will be released to support the community.

### [43] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of positive sampling Kantorovich operators and their convergence properties, including local/global approximation using SK, Gaussian, Bilateral, and wavelet-based operators with error metrics evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the approximation capabilities of various sampling Kantorovich operators and analyze their performance under different conditions for image processing applications.

Method: Introduced basic terminology and fundamental theorem of approximation, measured error using MSE, SI, SSI, SMPI, and ENL metrics at various resolution levels, conducted numerical examples including 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom analysis.

Result: Different operators showed varying significance for different image features due to the uneven nature of images (non-ideal conditions), with some operators performing well for specific features while others did not.

Conclusion: Various sampling Kantorovich operators have distinct advantages for different image features, and the choice of operator should depend on the specific characteristics of the image being processed.

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Federated learning framework for skeleton-based human activity recognition in industrial settings, achieving significant accuracy improvements over centralized approaches while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate real-time worker action recognition in smart manufacturing while addressing privacy concerns that make centralized data collection impractical in industrial environments.

Method: Developed a federated learning framework using a custom skeletal dataset of 8 industrial upper-body gestures, processed with modified FastPose model. Evaluated LSTM and Transformer backbones under four paradigms: centralized, local, FL with FedAvg, and federated ensemble learning.

Result: FL Transformer improved over centralized training by +12.4 percentage points globally, with FedEnsemble achieving +16.3 pp gain. On unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceeded centralized accuracy by +52.6 and +58.3 percentage points respectively.

Conclusion: Federated learning not only preserves privacy but significantly enhances cross-user generalization, making it a practical solution for scalable, privacy-aware human activity recognition in heterogeneous industrial settings.

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

TL;DR: LENS introduces a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes chain-of-thought reasoning and segmentation jointly, achieving state-of-the-art performance on text-prompted image segmentation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing supervised fine-tuning methods ignore explicit chain-of-thought reasoning at test time, limiting generalization to unseen prompts and domains.

Method: Scalable reinforcement learning framework with unified rewards spanning sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues to optimize reasoning process and segmentation end-to-end.

Result: Achieves 81.2% average cIoU on RefCOCO benchmarks, outperforming GLaMM by up to 5.6% using Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model.

Conclusion: RL-driven chain-of-thought reasoning serves as a robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and enables more generalizable Segment Anything models.

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at

*Md Ashiqur Rahman,Chiao-An Yang,Michael N. Cheng,Lim Jun Hao,Jeremiah Jiang,Teck-Yian Lim,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) method improves local scale equivariance in vision models to handle object scale variations, enhancing performance and scale consistency across popular architectures like ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision where objects of the same class can have different sizes and perceived sizes affected by camera distance. These variations are local to objects and require better handling to improve model robustness.

Method: The paper presents a deep equilibrium canonicalizer (DEC) that can be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and adapted to pre-trained models to improve local scale equivariance.

Result: On the competitive ImageNet benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency across four popular pre-trained deep-nets: ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT.

Conclusion: DEC effectively addresses scale variation challenges by enhancing local scale equivariance, demonstrating improved performance and consistency across multiple state-of-the-art vision architectures.

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetry is a fundamental geometric cue in computer vision, and recent advances in vision-language models like CLIP provide opportunities to leverage additional symmetry cues from natural image descriptions for improved detection.

Method: Proposes CLIPSym with CLIP's image/language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder using Transformer and G-Convolution. Introduces Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG) to aggregate diverse object-based prompts for better semantic integration.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Ablation studies confirm benefits of CLIP pre-training, equivariant decoder, and SAPG technique.

Conclusion: CLIPSym successfully leverages vision-language pre-training for symmetry detection, demonstrating that semantic cues from natural language descriptions can significantly improve geometric symmetry detection performance.

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at

TL;DR: Novel image classification framework combining Graph Convolutional Networks with Voronoi diagrams, achieving faster pre-processing and higher accuracy than state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage GCNs' capability for handling relational data in image classification by creating graph-based image representations using Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations, addressing limitations of conventional CNNs.

Method: Proposed normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN) that represents images as graphs where pixels/regions are vertices, simplified through Delaunay triangulations derived from Voronoi diagrams.

Result: Significant improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in complex scenes and fine-grained categories. NVGCN demonstrated faster performance than regular GCN.

Conclusion: Integration of GCNs with Voronoi diagrams shows strong potential for advancing image classification and opens new avenues for graph-based learning in computer vision and non-structured data domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the

TL;DR: A new learning mechanism improves multimodal model robustness by solving shuffling problems through image/text order reconstruction tasks and a directed-token approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large multimodal models suffer from robustness and generalization limitations due to alignment issues between visual and textual features.

Method: Introduces two tasks: reconstructing image order and text order during pre-training and fine-tuning. Uses directed-token approach to capture visual/textual knowledge and Image-to-Response Guided loss for better visual understanding.

Result: Consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively improves reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment in multimodal models.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

TL;DR: Data augmentation strategies significantly impact conformal prediction performance for diabetic retinopathy grading, with Mixup and CutMix improving both accuracy and uncertainty reliability while CLAHE can negatively affect model certainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for medical tasks like diabetic retinopathy grading need reliable uncertainty quantification for clinical deployment. Current models achieve high accuracy but lack robust uncertainty measures, and the interaction between standard training practices like data augmentation and conformal prediction guarantees is not well understood.

Method: Systematic evaluation of five data augmentation strategies (no augmentation, geometric transforms, CLAHE, Mixup, CutMix) on two backbone architectures (ResNet-50 and CoaT) using the DDR dataset for diabetic retinopathy grading. Analysis of conformal prediction metrics including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct efficiency.

Result: Sample-mixing strategies (Mixup and CutMix) improve both predictive accuracy and yield more reliable and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, CLAHE augmentation negatively impacts model certainty. The findings show augmentation choice significantly affects conformal prediction performance.

Conclusion: Augmentation strategies must be co-designed with downstream uncertainty quantification to build trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging. Mixup and CutMix are recommended for both accuracy and reliable uncertainty estimation in diabetic retinopathy grading.

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Method: GALA uses 3D Gaussian Splatting with self-supervised contrastive learning to distill scene-specific 3D instance features. It introduces a cross-attention module with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings, reducing memory consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D tasks, showing effective language-aware 3D scene understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: GALA successfully addresses the challenge of creating language-aware 3D representations from 2D images, enabling seamless open-vocabulary queries in both 2D and 3D while maintaining memory efficiency through its innovative codebook-based approach.

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

TL;DR: Proposes a contrastive conditional inference framework for explainable object recognition using CLIP, with a new multi-rationale benchmark and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable object recognition methods using CLIP suffer from weak conditioning on explanatory structures and limited single/noisy rationales that don't capture full feature diversity.

Method: Contrastive Conditional Inference (CCI) framework that explicitly models probabilistic relationships among image embeddings, category labels, and rationales without requiring training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark with strong zero-shot performance, setting new standards for classification accuracy and rationale quality.

Conclusion: Provides a more complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object recognition, along with a comprehensive benchmark and effective conditioning approach.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OccluNet is a spatio-temporal deep learning model that combines YOLOX object detection with transformer-based temporal attention to automatically detect vascular occlusions in DSA sequences, significantly outperforming baseline models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy is critical for acute ischemic stroke treatment, but interpreting DSA sequences is challenging due to anatomical complexity and time constraints.

Method: Proposed OccluNet integrating YOLOX object detector with transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms. Compared with YOLOv11 baseline on individual frames or minimum intensity projections. Explored two variants: pure temporal attention and divided space-time attention.

Result: Evaluation on DSA images from MR CLEAN Registry showed precision of 89.02% and recall of 74.87%. OccluNet significantly outperformed baseline models, with both attention variants achieving similar performance.

Conclusion: OccluNet effectively captures temporally consistent features for automated occlusion detection in DSA sequences, demonstrating superior performance over traditional approaches and providing a valuable tool for acute ischemic stroke treatment.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

*Yuguang Yue,Chris Green,Samuel Hunt,Irakli Salia,Wenzhe Shi,Jonathan J Hunt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pixels2Play-0.1 is a foundation model that learns to play 3D video games from pixel input using behavior cloning with both labeled human demonstrations and unlabeled public videos, achieving competent gameplay across various titles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create AI agents that can serve as teammates, controllable NPCs, personalized live-streamers, and assistive testers by relying solely on pixel input like human players and generalizing to new games with minimal engineering.

Method: End-to-end behavior cloning using labeled human demonstrations and unlabeled public videos with action imputation via inverse-dynamics model. Uses decoder-only transformer with auto-regressive action output for large action space handling on consumer GPUs.

Result: Competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles, with ablations showing benefits of unlabeled data. The model demonstrates recognizable human-like behavior.

Conclusion: P2P0.1 shows promise as a foundation model for game-playing AI, with scaling and evaluation steps outlined to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control in future versions.

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

*Guile Wu,David Huang,Dongfeng Bai,Bingbing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified diffusion transformer model for multi-modal multi-view video generation in autonomous driving, capable of generating RGB, depth maps, and semantic maps simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation approaches focus only on RGB and lack multi-modal support, while multi-modal data (depth maps, semantic maps) is crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous driving.

Method: Constructs a unified diffusion transformer model with modal-shared and modal-specific components, leveraging diverse conditioning inputs to encode controllable scene structure and content cues.

Result: Experiments on nuScenes dataset show the approach generates high-fidelity multi-modal multi-view urban scene videos with superior controllability compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed unified framework successfully addresses multi-modal video generation for autonomous driving, overcoming limitations of single-modal approaches and multiple separate models.

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

### [59] [Inter-Class Relational Loss for Small Object Detection: A Case Study on License Plates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14343)
*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes inter-class relational loss to improve small object detection by leveraging spatial relationships between objects, achieving significant mAP improvements without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based losses fail to properly update gradients for small objects due to flat gradients, causing insufficient learning for small objects during multi-object training.

Method: Uses spatial relationships between objects (e.g., car plate attached to car) to add loss punishment when predicted small objects are not within their related larger objects, inversely proportional to overlapped area.

Result: Achieved 10.3% and 1.6% mAP50 improvements for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR respectively, with new SVMLP dataset for license plate detection.

Conclusion: ICR loss can be easily integrated with existing IoU-based losses to enhance small object detection performance without additional hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

*Sean Fletcher,Gabby Scott,Douglas Currie,Xin Zhang,Yuqi Song,Bruce MacLeod*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New microscopy dataset and ResAttention-KNN model for automated Taxol effect monitoring using deep learning and attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Taxol monitoring methods require specialized equipment, skilled personnel, and extensive preparation, making them expensive and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. No public dataset exists for automated morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol.

Method: Created a new microscopy image dataset of C6 glioma cells treated with varying Taxol concentrations. Proposed ResAttention-KNN baseline model combining ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in embedding space.

Result: Developed a publicly available dataset and baseline model that integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to enhance robustness and interpretability for Taxol concentration classification.

Conclusion: The dataset and implementation are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research in vision-based biomedical analysis, providing a benchmark for automated morphological assessment of Taxol effects.

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

*Zhujun Li,Shuo Zhang,Ioannis Stamos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRC-Pose is a depth-only framework for category-level object pose estimation that uses contrastive learning to preserve 6D pose continuity, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks while running in real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches rely solely on 6D pose supervision without capturing intrinsic pose continuity, leading to prediction inconsistencies and poor generalization to unseen poses.

Method: Decouples object pose into rotation and translation components, uses contrastive learning with 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, and processes learned embeddings separately through dedicated pose estimation modules.

Result: Outperforms existing depth-only state-of-the-art methods on REAL275 and CAMERA25 benchmarks, learns continuous feature spaces, and runs in real-time.

Conclusion: HRC-Pose effectively addresses pose continuity issues through contrastive learning, demonstrating strong performance and real-time capability for practical applications.

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

*Ziqi Zhang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel method for emotion-controllable talking face generation that uses pre-training strategies to disentangle audio components and quantize videos into visual tokens, then employs emotion-anchor representations and an autoregressive transformer to synthesize emotional videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome challenges in modeling multimodal relationships for specific emotions and leveraging these relationships to synthesize identity-preserving emotional talking face videos from audio inputs.

Method: Uses two pre-training strategies: disentangling audio into independent components and quantizing videos into visual tokens. Introduces emotion-anchor representation to integrate emotional information into visual tokens. Employs an autoregressive transformer to model visual token distributions and predict index sequences for video synthesis.

Result: Extensive experiments on the MEAD dataset demonstrate superior performance both qualitatively and quantitatively in emotion-controllable talking face generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses emotion-controllable talking face generation by discretely modeling multimodal relationships and synthesizing high-quality emotional videos while preserving identity.

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Hamidreza Hashempoor,Yu Dong Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalized multi-object tracking framework that handles various object types with focus on vehicle tracking, featuring occlusion-aware re-ID and road-structure-aware refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional MOT systems are limited to pedestrian tracking and lack generalization to other object categories like vehicles in complex traffic scenes.

Method: Incorporates occlusion-aware re-identification for identity preservation and road-structure-aware tracklet refinement using semantic scene priors (lane directions, crosswalks, road boundaries). Also introduces a new benchmark dataset for vehicle tracking evaluation.

Result: Achieves robust performance on both new dataset and public benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking while maintaining strong performance on conventional pedestrian tracking benchmarks.

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

*Runshi Zhang,Bimeng Jie,Yang He,Junchen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TCFNet is a Transformer-based coarse-to-fine network for accurate face-bone point cloud transformation in surgical simulation, addressing limitations of traditional biomechanical and existing deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional biomechanical simulation methods are computationally intensive and low accuracy, while existing deep learning approaches have limited receptive fields, noisy outputs, and require complex preprocessing. There's a need for an end-to-end solution that can handle large-scale point clouds with precise transformations.

Method: Proposes TCFNet with two stages: 1) Transformer-based network for global feature extraction, 2) Local Information Aggregation Network (LIA-Net) to model local geometric structures. Uses gated recurrent unit to guide local displacement with global features, and includes auxiliary loss inspired by deformable medical image registration.

Result: TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization results compared to state-of-the-art methods on gathered datasets, demonstrating superior performance in face-bone point cloud transformations.

Conclusion: The proposed TCFNet framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods by combining Transformer-based global modeling with local geometric feature aggregation, providing an accurate and efficient solution for computer-aided surgical simulation without complex preprocessing requirements.

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

*Wenyong Zhou,Boyu Li,Jiachen Ren,Taiqiang Wu,Zhilin Ai,Zhengwu Liu,Ngai Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadINR introduces hardware-efficient implicit neural representations using piecewise quadratic activation functions, achieving superior performance with dramatically reduced hardware consumption compared to previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches to mitigate spectral bias in implicit neural representations used complex activation functions that incurred significant hardware overhead, creating a need for more hardware-efficient solutions.

Method: The paper proposes QuadINR which utilizes piecewise quadratic activation functions that contain rich harmonic content in their Fourier series, and develops a unified N-stage pipeline framework for efficient hardware implementation. The approach is verified through Neural Tangent Kernel analysis.

Result: QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior work, with only 1914μm² area and 6.14mW dynamic power, reducing resource consumption by up to 97% and power consumption by up to 97% while improving latency by up to 93%.

Conclusion: QuadINR demonstrates that piecewise quadratic activation functions provide an effective hardware-efficient solution for implicit neural representations, offering superior performance with dramatically reduced hardware requirements across both FPGA and ASIC implementations.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by
up to 93\% vs existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Img2ST-Net is a novel framework that generates high-resolution spatial transcriptomics data from histology images using parallel convolutional architecture instead of inefficient spot-by-spot methods, with a new SSIM-ST evaluation metric for sparse expression patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics (ST) data acquisition is expensive and time-consuming. Conventional sequential regression methods become inefficient and unstable at 8um+ resolutions, and the extreme sparsity of high-resolution ST complicates both prediction and evaluation.

Method: Proposes Img2ST-Net with fully convolutional architecture to generate dense HD gene expression maps in parallel. Reformulates the task as super-content image generation with hundreds/thousands of output channels by modeling HD ST data as super-pixel representations.

Result: The framework improves computational efficiency while preserving spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. Introduces SSIM-ST metric for robust evaluation under sparse expression patterns.

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net provides a scalable, biologically coherent solution for efficient and accurate high-resolution ST inference, laying groundwork for next-generation robust and resolution-aware ST modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

*Yue Gong,Shanyuan Liu,Liuzhuozheng Li,Jian Zhu,Bo Cheng,Liebucha Wu,Xiaoyu Wu,Yuhang Ma,Dawei Leng,Yuhui Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CTA-Flux is a Chinese text adapter that enables Flux (English-trained TTI model) to understand Chinese prompts while maintaining compatibility with existing plugins, using MMDiT for direct semantic control with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux performs poorly with non-English prompts due to linguistic and cultural biases in English-centric training. Existing translation or finetuning approaches fail to preserve culturally specific semantics, compromising image authenticity.

Method: Leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to directly control the Flux backbone, reducing parameter count while enhancing Chinese semantic understanding without full model retraining.

Result: Empirical evaluations show CTA-flux supports both Chinese and English prompts, achieving superior image generation quality, visual realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Conclusion: CTA-flux effectively bridges Chinese semantic understanding with English-centric TTI models, improving cultural authenticity while maintaining plugin compatibility through efficient parameter usage.

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

*Jeahun Sung,Changhyun Roh,Chanho Eom,Jihyong Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoCHA-former is a transformer-based model that effectively removes moiré patterns from camera-captured screen content by addressing spatially varying artifacts, large-scale structures, channel dependencies, and temporal fluctuations through decoupled moiré adaptive demoiréing and spatio-temporal adaptive components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Camera-based screen capture suffers from moiré patterns caused by frequency aliasing between camera CFA and display sub-pixels, degrading photo/video quality. Existing demoiréing methods fail to handle spatially varying artifact strength, large-scale structures, channel-dependent statistics, and temporal fluctuations across frames.

Method: MoCHA-former uses two main components: Decoupled Moiré Adaptive Demoiréing (DMAD) with Moiré Decoupling Block and Detail Decoupling Block to separate moiré/content, and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoiréing (STAD) with Spatial Fusion Block for large structures and Feature Channel Attention for channel dependence. Performs implicit frame alignment without explicit modules.

Result: Evaluated on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains, MoCHA-former consistently outperforms prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, demonstrating superior moiré removal capabilities.

Conclusion: MoCHA-former effectively addresses key limitations in moiré pattern removal through its hybrid adaptive transformer architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations for screen content demoiréing.

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

*Bing Han,Yuhua Huang,Pan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperDiff integrates diffusion models with HyperGCN to address depth ambiguity and occlusion in monocular 3D human pose estimation, achieving state-of-the-art performance while balancing efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D human pose estimation methods suffer from depth ambiguity, occlusion issues, and overlook multi-scale skeleton features during 2D-to-3D lifting, which reduces accuracy.

Method: Proposes HyperDiff method combining diffusion models (to capture data uncertainty and handle ambiguity/occlusion) with HyperGCN as denoiser (using multi-granularity structures to model high-order joint correlations).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, with flexible adaptation to varying computational resources for performance-efficiency balance.

Conclusion: The integration of diffusion models with HyperGCN effectively addresses key challenges in monocular 3D pose estimation, particularly depth ambiguity and complex pose handling, while maintaining computational flexibility.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS is a frequency-based conditioning approach using diffusion models to preserve task-relevant knowledge while adapting to domain shifts during test-time adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple corruption types and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time adaptation methods struggle to balance preserving existing knowledge with adapting to domain shifts, as adaptation can cause catastrophic forgetting of task-relevant semantic information.

Method: Proposes FOCUS - a frequency-based conditioning approach within a diffusion-driven framework that uses learned frequency priors to condition reverse denoising steps. Uses a Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network (Y-FPN) to disentangle high/low frequency information and FrequencyMix data augmentation for robustness.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art averaged performance for semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets. Also complements existing model adaptation methods by providing pseudo labels from denoised images.

Conclusion: FOCUS effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while enabling robust test-time adaptation, demonstrating strong performance across diverse corruptions and serving as a valuable complement to existing adaptation methods.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-image diffusion models struggle with multi-subject compositional synthesis that requires both precise spatial control and faithful reconstruction of reference subjects in specified regions.

Method: Proposes MUSE framework with concatenated cross-attention (CCA) for bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and text, plus a progressive two-stage training strategy to decompose the task into learnable sub-objectives.

Result: Extensive experiments show MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions.

Conclusion: MUSE advances controllable image synthesis by successfully addressing the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity preservation in layout-controllable multi-subject generation.

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: Multimodal integration with NIR data and text metadata significantly improves agricultural 3D reconstruction. The proposed NIRSplat architecture effectively addresses agricultural scene challenges and provides comprehensive environmental understanding.

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer interaction, but current methods suffer from poor generalizability across diverse domains and difficulty modeling complex interaction dynamics.

Method: Proposes DAPA with Domain Prompting mechanism (learnable domain-specific vectors) and Parallel Cross-Attention module that aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM) states between participants.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on cross-cultural and cross-linguistic benchmarks, with 0.45 CCC improvement on NoXi-J test set, and won first place in Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at MultiMediate'25.

Conclusion: DAPA effectively addresses domain generalization challenges in engagement estimation through explicit domain conditioning and interaction synchrony modeling, demonstrating superior performance across diverse conversational contexts.

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at

*Yuhang Guo,Kaijun Deng,Siyang Song,Jindong Xie,Wenhui Ma,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D^3-Talker is a novel 3D talking head synthesis method that uses separate Gaussian attribute deformation fields for audio and facial motion signals, achieving better lip sync and image quality with limited training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D talking head synthesis methods require extensive training data per identity and struggle with audio-to-lip mapping due to irrelevant audio information, leading to poor synchronization and quality.

Method: Constructs static 3D Gaussian attribute field with separate deformation fields for audio and facial motion signals, uses similarity contrastive loss for decoupling, and incorporates Coarse-to-Fine module for image refinement.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization with limited training data.

Conclusion: D^3-Talker effectively addresses the data efficiency and lip synchronization challenges in 3D talking head synthesis through decoupled deformation fields and refined rendering techniques.

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Ouroboros demonstrates effective mutual reinforcement between forward and inverse rendering with cycle consistency, enabling efficient and high-quality rendering across various scene types and video applications.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward
and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The demand for customized video editing is growing rapidly, but current subject swapping approaches are either domain-specific or rely on indirect editing methods that compromise fidelity. There's a need for a general-purpose, high-fidelity video subject swapping solution.

Method: Proposes DreamSwapV - a mask-guided, subject-agnostic framework with multiple conditions and a dedicated condition fusion module. Uses adaptive mask strategy for varying subject scales and attributes. Employs elaborate two-phase dataset construction and training scheme.

Result: Outperforms existing methods as validated by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and the newly introduced DreamSwapV-Benchmark, demonstrating superior performance in video subject swapping.

Conclusion: DreamSwapV provides an effective end-to-end solution for customized video editing through subject swapping, addressing limitations of previous approaches and achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved fidelity and flexibility.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing

Result: Extensive experiments show Vivid-VR outperforms existing approaches on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness, and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses distribution drift issues in controllable video generation pipelines and demonstrates superior performance in video restoration tasks across various benchmarks.

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,

Method: SATURN extends VAR-CLIP by translating scene graphs into salience-ordered token sequences, allowing a frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while only fine-tuning the VAR transformer component.

Result: On Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from 56.45% to 21.62% and increases Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78, outperforming SG2IM and SGDiff without extra modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results show improved object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy.

Conclusion: SATURN effectively combines structural awareness from scene graphs with state-of-the-art autoregressive fidelity, providing a lightweight solution for improved text-to-image generation with better layout and relationship understanding.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by

Method: PB-IAD uses a prompt-based framework with multimodal foundation models (GPT-4.1), featuring a specialized prompt template for iterative domain knowledge implementation and a pre-processing module that translates user inputs into effective system prompts.

Result: The framework demonstrated superior performance across three manufacturing scenarios and two data modalities, particularly excelling in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like PatchCore.

Conclusion: PB-IAD provides an effective, user-centric solution for industrial anomaly detection that requires minimal data science expertise, offering strong performance through semantic instructions alone and addressing key challenges in dynamic manufacturing environments.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure

framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

*Jiangfan Liu,Yongkang Guo,Fangzhi Zhong,Tianyuan Zhang,Zonglei Jing,Siyuan Liang,Jiakai Wang,Mingchuan Zhang,Aishan Liu,Xianglong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScenGE is a framework that uses LLMs to generate diverse safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle testing, combining adversarial reasoning with traffic flow amplification to uncover more collision cases than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluation methods for autonomous vehicles rely on predefined threat patterns and rule-based strategies, which lack diversity and fail to expose unforeseen failure modes, limiting comprehensive safety assessment.

Method: ScenGE uses a two-stage approach: 1) Meta-Scenario Generation where an LLM grounded in driving knowledge infers plausible adversarial agents, and 2) Complex Scenario Evolution that amplifies threats using background vehicles and adversarial collaborator graphs to optimize trajectories that reduce maneuvering space and create critical occlusions.

Result: Extensive experiments show ScenGE uncovers 31.96% more severe collision cases than state-of-the-art baselines on multiple RL-based AV models. The framework works with large model-based AV systems, different simulators, and adversarial training improves model robustness. Real-world tests and human evaluation confirm scenario plausibility and criticality.

Conclusion: ScenGE represents a critical advancement in autonomous vehicle safety testing by generating diverse, plausible safety-critical scenarios that can improve model robustness and help build public trust for safe deployment.

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

*Yonghan Shin,SeungKyu Kim,Won-Ki Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE is an adaptive framework that reduces computational pathology processing time by 3x+ using vision-language models to selectively encode only diagnostically relevant regions in whole slide images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide images in computational pathology require processing tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per slide, resulting in prohibitive encoding costs and days/weeks of preprocessing time, making WSI encoding the major bottleneck for real-world deployment.

Method: Uses pathology-domain vision-language models and large language models to compute similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific textual descriptions. Selects a small subset of informative regions, quickly eliminates irrelevant patches, and selectively encodes high-resolution patches fused with textual embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context.

Result: Extensive experiments show WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing exhaustive patch processing methods.

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE offers a scalable and practical solution for computational pathology by significantly reducing processing time while maintaining diagnostic accuracy through selective encoding of relevant regions.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

TL;DR: Unsupervised method using document character redundancy to improve OCR accuracy for degraded documents through extended GMM with EM algorithm and statistical testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OCR systems struggle with low-quality data and high inter-domain variability, failing to exploit document redundancy for better character recognition.

Method: Extended Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation-Maximization algorithm, intra-cluster realignment, and normality statistical testing to leverage character shape redundancy within documents.

Result: Demonstrated improvements on various degraded documents including Uruguayan military archives and historical European newspapers from 17th-20th century.

Conclusion: The proposed unsupervised approach effectively corrects imperfect OCR outputs by utilizing intra-document character redundancy, showing promise for handling degraded historical documents.

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

*Sukhyun Jeong,Hong-Gi Shin,Yong-Hoon Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a method to enhance controllable motion generation by augmenting discrete pose codes with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization, improving both motion quality and controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained motion details, limiting expressiveness in controllable motion generation. The paper aims to overcome this limitation while preserving interpretability and manipulability.

Method: Augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion features using residual vector quantization (RVQ) to capture subtle motion characteristics and high-frequency details.

Result: Experiments on HumanML3D show FID reduction from 0.041 to 0.015 and Top-1 R-Precision improvement from 0.508 to 0.510. Qualitative analysis confirms enhanced controllability for motion editing.

Conclusion: The proposed RVQ-based augmentation successfully preserves pose code interpretability while significantly improving motion generation quality and fine-grained control capabilities.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

*Sujin Jeon,Hyundo Lee,Eungseo Kim,Sanghack Lee,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Inwoo Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LCBM improves concept localization in label-free concept bottleneck models using prototype learning to ensure concepts are predicted from relevant image regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing label-free CBMs often fail to localize concepts properly, attending to irrelevant regions when predicting concept presence, which limits their interpretability and reliability.

Method: Proposes LCBM framework that assigns one prototype per concept, learned to represent prototypical image features. Uses foundation models to ensure prototype relevance and encourages encoding of similar local regions to facilitate proper concept localization.

Result: Experimental results show LCBM effectively identifies present concepts and exhibits improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance to existing methods.

Conclusion: LCBM successfully addresses the localization problem in label-free CBMs through prototype learning, enhancing spatial concept localization without sacrificing classification accuracy.

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOGS is a two-stage framework using 2D Gaussian surfels for inverse rendering of glossy objects, addressing limitations of NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods by combining physics-based rendering with geometric priors and Monte Carlo sampling for accurate material decomposition and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inverse rendering methods for glossy objects face limitations: NeRF-based approaches are computationally expensive, while 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with specular reflections, causing surface noise and poor relighting results due to simplified rendering equations.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Robust surface reconstruction using physics-based rendering with split-sum approximation and geometric priors from foundation models; 2) Material decomposition via Monte Carlo importance sampling, differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing for indirect illumination, and spherical mipmap-based directional encoding for anisotropic highlights.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering approaches.

Conclusion: GOGS successfully addresses the fundamental limitations of inverse rendering for glossy objects by combining efficient 2D Gaussian surfels with advanced physics-based rendering techniques, achieving high-quality reconstruction and plausible relighting results.

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Conclusion: The dataset and Accid3nD model provide valuable resources for understanding and detecting real-world highway accidents, with demonstrated effectiveness through experiments

Abstract: Even though a significant amount of work has been done to increase the safety
of transportation networks, accidents still occur regularly. They must be
understood as an unavoidable and sporadic outcome of traffic networks. We
present the TUM Traffic Accident (TUMTraf-A) dataset, a collection of
real-world highway accidents. It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at
high-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and
track IDs within 48,144 labeled frames recorded from four roadside cameras and
LiDARs at 10 Hz. The dataset contains ten object classes and is provided in the
OpenLABEL format. We propose Accid3nD, an accident detection model that
combines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one. Experiments and

TL;DR: HistAug is a generative model for controllable latent space augmentations in digital pathology that efficiently generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving semantic information, improving MIL model performance particularly in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide image analysis faces challenges due to gigapixel resolution and scarce supervision. Traditional patch-level augmentation is computationally expensive, while existing feature-level methods lack transformation control, creating a need for efficient and controllable augmentation techniques.

Method: HistAug uses a generative model conditioned on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion) to generate realistic augmented embeddings in latent space. It processes large numbers of patches efficiently in a single forward pass while preserving semantic information.

Result: Experiments across multiple slide-level tasks and diverse organs show HistAug outperforms existing methods, with particularly strong performance in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm benefits over noise-based perturbations and highlight importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation.

Conclusion: HistAug provides an efficient and effective solution for data augmentation in digital pathology, enabling robust MIL model training with controllable transformations that improve performance, especially when training data is limited.

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

TL;DR: A novel two-phase uncertainty-aware transformer framework for robust smoke detection using optical flow-based motion encoding and multi-scale uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fire outbreaks require reliable early-warning systems, but smoke detection is challenging due to complex spatiotemporal dynamics, illumination variability, and environmental noise that undermine traditional detectors.

Method: Proposes a Two-Phase Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer that integrates smoke feature representations from monocular imagery. Uses optical flow-based motion encoding with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set fractional-order variational model to preserve motion discontinuities. Fuses color-encoded optical flow maps with appearance cues via Gaussian Mixture Model for binary segmentation. Includes multi-scale uncertainty estimation head trained under two-phase learning: first optimizes detection accuracy, second learns plausibility confidence by modeling aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization and robustness compared to state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The framework offers a reliable solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and autonomous monitoring applications by addressing complex smoke dynamics through integrated feature fusion and uncertainty-aware learning.

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual prompt-based methods underperform in incremental object detection compared to image classification, but combining prompts with limited data replay achieves best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the generalizability of visual prompt-based methods from incremental image classification to incremental object detection, as no prior work has applied these approaches to IOD.

Method: Analyzed three different prompt-based methods under complex domain-incremental learning setting with comprehensive baseline comparisons. Tested prompt length and initialization variations, and combined visual prompts with replaying small portions of previous data.

Result: Prompt-based approaches underperformed in IOD setting, but the combination of visual prompts with limited data replay achieved the best performance among tested methods.

Conclusion: While visual prompt methods alone struggle in IOD, their combination with data replay shows promise, providing valuable insights for advancing prompt-based incremental learning in object detection.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

Conclusion: Virtual Community provides a foundation for further research on human-robot coexistence in open-world environments, addressing both social intelligence and practical cooperation challenges.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UST-SSM extends Selective State Space Models to handle point cloud videos by addressing spatio-temporal disorder through semantic-aware sequence reorganization and feature aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud videos are effective for recognizing subtle human actions but suffer from spatio-temporal disorder when directly processed as 1D sequences by SSMs, limiting their modeling effectiveness.

Method: Proposes UST-SSM with three key components: Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS) for semantic-aware sequence reorganization, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) for feature compensation, and Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) for enhanced temporal dependencies.

Result: Experimental validation on MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D, and Synthia 4D datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: UST-SSM successfully addresses the spatio-temporal disorder challenge in point cloud videos, enabling effective utilization of SSMs for dynamic 3D motion recognition with improved performance.

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion

*Pengzhi Zhong,Xinzhe Wang,Dan Zeng,Qihua Zhou,Feixiang He,Shuiwang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMTrack is the first directly-trained deep Spiking Neural Network framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos, achieving performance comparable to ANN-based methods through adaptive scale-aware loss and identity tracking modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking Neural Networks show low-power computation potential but their application in visual tasks is limited to basic tasks like classification and detection. The potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks like multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos remains underexplored.

Method: Proposes SMTrack framework with adaptive scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) that dynamically adjusts normalization based on average object size per batch. Incorporates TrackTrack identity module for robust association and consistent object trajectories.

Result: Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack datasets show SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based multi-object tracking methods.

Conclusion: SMTrack advances robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios, demonstrating that directly-trained SNNs can effectively handle multi-object tracking tasks on standard RGB video streams.

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with structural drift and temporal artifacts in long videos, making high-quality editing challenging for minute-long sequences.

Method: Decouples editing into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth intermediate frame interpolation, using progressive denoising and multimodal guidance for structural consistency and temporal dynamics.

Result: Extensive experiments show AnchorSync produces coherent, high-fidelity edits with superior visual quality and temporal stability compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: AnchorSync effectively addresses long video editing challenges by maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence through its novel diffusion-based framework.

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces

*Muhammad Ibraheem Siddiqui,Muhammad Umer Sheikh,Hassan Abid,Kevin Henry,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PerSense++ is a training-free one-shot segmentation framework that uses density maps and adaptive filtering to handle dense visual scenes with occlusions and clutter, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in dense visual scene segmentation including occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations that make instance segmentation difficult.

Method: Uses Instance Detection Module with density maps for candidate prompts, Point Prompt Selection Module with adaptive thresholding, and feedback mechanism. PerSense++ adds diversity-aware exemplar selection, hybrid IDM combining contour/peak prompts, and Irrelevant Mask Rejection Module.

Result: Extensive experiments show PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The framework effectively handles dense segmentation challenges through training-free, model-agnostic approach with novel components for instance detection and false positive filtering.

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

### [99] [GeMS: Efficient Gaussian Splatting for Extreme Motion Blur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14682)
*Gopi Raju Matta,Trisha Reddypalli,Vemunuri Divya Madhuri,Kaushik Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS is a 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs 3D scenes directly from severely motion-blurred images without requiring sharp reference images, using deep learning-based SfM and probabilistic Gaussian initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deblurring and 3D reconstruction methods fail with extreme motion blur because they typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose estimation and point cloud generation, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with severe blur.

Method: GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM for pose estimation and point cloud generation from blurred inputs, (2) 3DGS-MCMC treating Gaussians as probability samples for robust initialization, and (3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters. GeMS-E adds event-based EDI deblurring for progressive refinement.

Result: Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, successfully reconstructing 3D scenes from extremely blurred images.

Conclusion: This is the first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from severely blurred inputs, eliminating the need for sharp reference images and overcoming limitations of traditional COLMAP-based approaches.

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

*Jiabo Huang,Chen Chen,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-driven approach that unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in shared latent space to build vision foundation models without needing large labeled datasets or high-end GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models rely on data-centric methods requiring vast labeled data and high-end GPUs, creating barriers for most institutions. Many open-source domain-specific models exist but remain underutilized for general-purpose VFM development.

Method: Joint knowledge transfer and preservation approach that unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in shared latent space to mitigate distributional gaps. Uses knowledge preservation strategy with general-purpose teacher as base and adapter modules to integrate purpose-specific teachers.

Result: Outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks: image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. Provides generalizable visual features and inherently supports multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The model-driven approach successfully builds powerful vision foundation models by unifying and aggregating existing pre-trained models, eliminating the need for large labeled datasets while inheriting teachers' expertise across diverse vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSFix3D improves 3D Gaussian Splatting by integrating diffusion model knowledge to enhance renderings from extreme viewpoints and inpaint missing regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles with extreme novel viewpoints and partially observed regions, while diffusion models lack scene-specific awareness for accurate 3D reconstruction. The paper aims to combine their strengths.

Method: Introduces GSFixer, a latent diffusion model fine-tuned to leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians, using a random mask augmentation strategy for plausible inpainting of missing regions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks, requires minimal scene-specific fine-tuning, and demonstrates resilience to pose errors in real-world tests.

Conclusion: GSFix3D successfully bridges the gap between generative capabilities of diffusion models and scene consistency of 3D representations, enabling robust novel view repair for unseen camera poses.

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety in autonomous driving by detecting unknown objects and handling unforeseen scenarios, overcoming limitations of class-dependent segmentation and expensive visual grounding methods.

Method: Multiscale video transformer with multi-stage query-memory decoding, scale-specific random drop-token, and shared learnable memory module to preserve spatiotemporal features without optical flow.

Result: Consistently outperforms multiscale baselines on DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time.

Conclusion: Demonstrates promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical robotics applications.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

*Abhijith Punnappurath,Luxi Zhao,Hoang Le,Abdelrahman Abdelhamed,SaiKiran Kumar Tedla,Michael S. Brown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dataset and neural network approach for RAW image illumination and sensor mapping to reduce data capture burden for deep learning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAW images have sensor-specific color properties and illumination-dependent color casts, making it challenging to capture comprehensive datasets for each sensor and illumination condition.

Method: Created a first-of-its-kind dataset using a customized lightbox with tunable illumination spectra to capture scenes under 390 illuminations with 4 cameras across 18 scenes, then developed a lightweight neural network for illumination and sensor mapping.

Result: The proposed neural network approach outperforms competing methods and demonstrates utility in training neural ISP (Image Signal Processor) systems.

Conclusion: The introduced dataset and mapping method provide an effective solution for reducing the data capture burden in RAW image processing, enabling better performance in downstream tasks like neural ISP training.

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

*Fabian Holst,Emre Gülsoylu,Simone Frintrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Novel technique fuses monocular RGB images with AIS data to create 6D pose estimation datasets for marine vessels, eliminating need for manual annotation and achieving high accuracy with PnP method and YOLOX-X detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of relying purely on AIS data for vessel location due to equipment reliability issues, data manipulation, and transmission delays by combining visual detection with AIS information.

Method: Combines vessel detections from monocular RGB images using YOLOX-X object detection network with AIS messages to generate 3D bounding boxes representing 6D poses. Compares homography and Perspective-n-Point transformation methods for data alignment.

Result: Perspective-n-Point method achieves significantly lower projection error than homography. YOLOX-X achieves mAP of 0.80 at IoU threshold 0.5. Created BONK-pose dataset with 3753 images and 3D bounding box annotations, plus 1000 images with 2D annotations for ship detection.

Conclusion: The approach successfully creates accurate 6D pose estimation datasets without manual annotation, providing valuable resources for training and evaluating pose estimation networks in marine environments.

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

*Zhichao Li,Arren Glover,Chiara Bartolozzi,Lorenzo Natale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combines event camera optical flow with RGB-based pose estimation for high-speed 6-DoF object tracking, leveraging both sensor types' advantages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-speed object tracking is challenging due to frame rate limitations and motion blur in conventional cameras. Event cameras offer high temporal resolution but lack rich visual information, while RGB cameras provide better single-shot pose estimation but suffer from motion issues at high speeds.

Method: Proposes event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to track 6-DoF velocity. Integrates this high-frequency velocity data with low-frequency pose estimates from RGB-based global pose estimator.

Result: Tested and validated on both synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating effectiveness particularly in high-speed motion scenarios where traditional methods struggle.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully exploits complementary advantages of event and RGB cameras, enabling robust 6-DoF pose tracking for high-speed moving objects by combining high-temporal-resolution motion data with rich visual pose estimation.

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

*Mengliang Zhang,Jacob M. Luber*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study on hospital domain bias in pathology foundation models, proposes adversarial framework with gradient reversal layer to remove hospital-specific features while maintaining disease classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathology images from different hospitals vary due to scanning hardware and preprocessing differences, causing PFMs to learn hospital-specific features that pose risks for clinical deployment.

Method: Lightweight adversarial framework with trainable adapter and domain classifier connected through gradient reversal layer (GRL) to remove latent hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying encoder.

Result: Substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining/improving disease classification performance, especially in out-of-domain scenarios. Hospital detection and feature visualization confirm effectiveness.

Conclusion: Proposed method successfully mitigates hospital bias in PFMs, enabling more robust clinical deployment across different hospital domains.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

*Kihyun Na,Junseok Oh,Youngkwan Cho,Bumjin Kim,Sungmin Cho,Jinyoung Choi,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MF-LPR^2 is a multi-frame license plate restoration framework that uses optical flow alignment and spatio-temporal consistency to enhance low-quality dash cam images, achieving superior restoration quality and recognition accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: License plate recognition in dash cam images is challenging due to low resolution, motion blur, and glare. Existing generative models relying on pretrained priors often introduce artifacts and cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images.

Method: Proposed MF-LPR^2 framework uses optical flow estimation with filtering and refinement algorithms to align and aggregate neighboring frames, leveraging spatio-temporal consistency instead of pretrained knowledge. Also created a realistic RLPR dataset for evaluation.

Result: Outperformed 8 restoration models in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Achieved 86.44% recognition accuracy, significantly better than single-frame (14.04%) and multi-frame (82.55%) baselines. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of filtering and refinement algorithms.

Conclusion: The multi-frame approach with optical flow alignment and spatio-temporal consistency processing effectively addresses license plate restoration challenges in poor-quality dash cam images, providing both improved image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving evidential content.

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitation of learning-based medical image registration methods that require large amounts of training data, which hinders clinical adoption.

Method: Proposes a training-free pipeline that uses a frozen DINOv3 encoder and performs test-time optimization of the deformation field directly in feature space.

Result: Achieved best mean Dice score (0.790) with lowest HD95 (4.9±5.0) and SDLogJ (0.08±0.02) on Abdomen MR-CT, and improved mean DSC to 0.769 with reduced SDLogJ (0.11) and HD95 (4.8) on ACDC cardiac MRI.

Conclusion: Operating in a compact foundation feature space at test time provides a practical and general solution for clinical registration without additional training requirements.

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Motivation: Prior 3D editing techniques require extensive per-scene optimization and many consistent input views, creating barriers to scalable 3D content creation. Tinker aims to enable robust editing from minimal inputs without scene-specific training.

Method: Repurposes pretrained diffusion models for latent 3D awareness. Uses two novel components: (1) Referring multi-view editor for precise reference-driven edits across viewpoints, (2) Any-view-to-video synthesizer leveraging spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion for scene completion and novel-view generation from sparse inputs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. Significantly reduces barrier to generalizable 3D content creation with robust multi-view consistent edits from minimal inputs.

Conclusion: Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing by eliminating per-scene optimization requirements while maintaining high fidelity across diverse scenes and editing tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

### [110] [Repeating Words for Video-Language Retrieval with Coarse-to-Fine Objectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14812)
*Haoyu Zhao,Jiaxi Gu,Shicong Wang,Xing Zhang,Hang Xu,Zuxuan Wu,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for video-language retrieval that uses fine-grained feature learning and an inference pipeline to improve accuracy without additional training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of high computational demands in large-scale pre-training methods and underutilization of fine-grained information in video-text retrieval.

Method: Coarse-to-fine objectives with contrastive and matching learning, Granularity-Aware Representation module for fine-grained data, and inference pipeline with voting mechanism and Matching Entropy metric.

Result: Outperforms previous approaches on four benchmarks, achieving 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on MSR-VTT and 1.6% increase on DiDeMo dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves video-language retrieval performance through fine-grained feature learning and a novel inference strategy without requiring additional pre-training.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

### [111] [TransLight: Image-Guided Customized Lighting Control with Generative Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14814)
*Zongming Li,Lianghui Zhu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TransLight is a novel framework that enables high-fidelity transfer of complex light effects between images using generative decoupling to separate content from lighting, achieving superior illumination control compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing illumination-editing approaches fail to provide customized light effect control while preserving content integrity, making them ineffective for practical lighting stylization tasks, particularly when transferring complex light effects from reference to target images.

Method: Uses Generative Decoupling with two fine-tuned diffusion models to separate image content and light effects, creating a million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Employs IC-Light as generative model trained with these triplets, injecting reference lighting as additional conditioning signal.

Result: TransLight successfully transfers light effects across disparate images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing techniques and enabling natural transfer of diverse light effects with high fidelity and flexibility.

Conclusion: The method establishes TransLight as the first successful approach for cross-image light effect transfer, charting new directions for illumination harmonization and editing research through thorough disentanglement of light effects from reference images.

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventSSEG is a novel event-only road segmentation method using probabilistic attention and self-supervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Road segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles but challenging with frame-based cameras due to latency and compute requirements. Event cameras offer low-power sensing but face challenges in transferring pretrained weights and scarce labeled data.

Method: EventSSEG uses event-only computing with a probabilistic attention mechanism and employs event-based self-supervised learning to eliminate the need for extensive labeled data.

Result: Experiments show EventSSEG achieves state-of-the-art performance on DSEC-Semantic and DDD17 datasets with minimal labeled events.

Conclusion: This approach successfully maximizes event cameras' capabilities while addressing the critical challenge of limited labeled event data for road segmentation.

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study analyzes pancreas size/shape changes across lifespan (0-90 years) using AI on CT/MRI scans, finds significant morphological differences in type 2 diabetes patients vs controls, and establishes normative aging trends.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding pancreatic changes is crucial for detecting deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic diseases. Need to establish reliable imaging modalities and normative aging trends for clinical applications.

Method: Analyzed 2533 patients with abdominal CT/MRI scans. Resampled to 3mm resolution, used automated segmentation to extract 13 morphological features. Compared CT vs MRI measurements, characterized normative patterns by age/sex, and used GAMLSS regression on 1350 age/sex-matched patients (675 controls + 675 diabetes) to identify diabetes-related deviations.

Result: 10 of 13 morphological features showed significantly different aging trends between diabetic and non-diabetic patients after multiple comparisons corrections. MRI yielded different measurements than CT. Pancreas was smaller in type 2 diabetes patients.

Conclusion: Provides lifespan trends showing altered pancreas size/shape in type 2 diabetes. Establishes reference for normative pancreas morphology from large non-diabetic cohort. Reinforces that pancreas is smaller in type 2 diabetes, with implications for clinical detection and monitoring.

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

*Mert Kiray,Alvaro Ritter,Nassir Navab,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-CLR is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that aligns pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions from the same sequence to learn structural invariances and improve generalization in skeleton-based action recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing contrastive learning methods for skeleton-based action recognition rely on single skeleton conventions, limiting their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint structures and anatomical coverage.

Method: Proposes Multi-Skeleton Contrastive Learning (MS-CLR) that aligns pose representations across multiple skeleton conventions from the same sequence. Adapts ST-GCN architecture with a unified representation scheme to handle varying joint layouts and scales.

Result: MS-CLR consistently improves performance over single-skeleton contrastive learning baselines on NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets. Multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: Aligning representations across multiple skeleton conventions enables learning of structural invariances and diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable features for skeleton-based action recognition.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

*Licheng Shen,Saining Zhang,Honghan Li,Peilin Yang,Zihao Huang,Zongzheng Zhang,Hao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified method using articulated 3D Gaussians to jointly model geometry and motion for reconstructing complex articulated objects with up to 20 parts, outperforming previous approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods separate geometry reconstruction and motion estimation, complicating pipelines and limiting scalability for objects with complex multi-part articulation.

Method: Introduces a unified representation using articulated 3D Gaussians that jointly models geometry and motion, improving robustness in motion decomposition.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry reconstruction and motion estimation across diverse object types, significantly outperforming prior methods that struggle beyond 2-3 parts.

Conclusion: The unified articulated representation demonstrates strong potential for scalable physical modeling and downstream applications like robotic simulation and human-scene interaction.

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

TL;DR: GLASS introduces training-free dynamic pruning for LLMs using rank-aggregation of local and global neuron statistics, outperforming previous methods in long-form generation without inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployment of LLMs requires aggressive pruning to reduce computation while maintaining quality. Existing methods either use fixed sparsity patterns, incur runtime overhead, or fail on short prompts/long generations.

Method: A/I-GLASS uses activation- and impact-based global-local neural importance aggregation to dynamically select FFN units through rank-aggregation of prompt local statistics and model-intrinsic global statistics.

Result: Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks show GLASS significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, especially in challenging long-form generation scenarios.

Conclusion: GLASS provides effective training-free dynamic pruning without auxiliary predictors or inference overhead, making it suitable for edge deployment of large language models.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuPO is a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that generates annotation-free feedback through generalized duality, eliminating the need for costly labels and expanding beyond strictly dual task pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of RLVR (requiring costly labels and restricted to verifiable tasks) and traditional dual learning (limited to strictly dual task pairs), enabling broader applicability to non-invertible tasks.

Method: Decomposes primal task input into known/unknown components, constructs dual task to reconstruct unknown parts using primal output and known information, uses reconstruction quality as self-supervised reward to optimize primal task via LLMs.

Result: Achieves 2.13 COMET improvement in translation over 756 directions, 6.4% accuracy boost in mathematical reasoning on three benchmarks, and 9.3 point improvement as inference-time reranker.

Conclusion: DuPO presents a scalable, general, and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization that works across diverse tasks without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

*Donghwa Kang,Doohyun Kim,Sang-Ki Ko,Jinkyu Lee,Brent ByungHoon Kang,Hyeongboo Baek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAS framework reduces SNN latency and energy consumption by 30-46% while improving accuracy through spatio-temporal adaptive computation and unified input representation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have energy efficiency advantages over ANNs but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to multi-timestep operations. Existing dynamic computation methods are fragmented and don't work well with SNN-based vision Transformers due to temporal dissimilarity issues and static architecture limitations.

Method: Proposed STAS framework with integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to create unified input representation for temporal stability, and adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module for 2D token pruning across spatial and temporal axes.

Result: On CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by 45.9%, 43.8%, and 30.1% respectively while improving accuracy over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: STAS successfully addresses SNN latency and efficiency problems through co-design of static architecture and dynamic computation policy, enabling effective spatio-temporal adaptive computation for spiking transformers.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage large language models for simulating complex human physiological systems, particularly for critical care applications like sepsis management, where accurate multi-system simulation can improve diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Method: Multi-agent framework with LLM-driven agents modeling specific physiological systems. Training involves supervised fine-tuning on system-specific time-series data followed by reinforcement-guided coordination with dynamic reference selection and error correction. Uses data from 7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls across 9 systems and 125 variables.

Result: Achieved high simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients with per-system MSEs <0.16. External validation on 22,689 ICU patients showed moderate degradation but stable simulation. Faithfully reproduces critical multi-system events with coherent timing. Physicians rated realism and plausibility highly (3.9 and 3.7 on Likert scale). Enables counterfactual simulations with aligned APACHE II scores.

Conclusion: Organ-Agents represents a credible, interpretable digital twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in critical care, with preserved decision-relevant patterns in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

*Samarth Gupta,Raghudeep Gadde,Rui Chen,Aleix M. Martinez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper challenges the assumption that diffusion models require many latent states/time-steps for training. The authors show that careful noise schedule selection enables training with as few as 32 states (matching performance of 1000-state models) and even push to single latent-state models that can be combined for high-quality generation with 4-6x faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the fundamental assumption in diffusion models that a large number of latent states or time-steps is necessary for training, aiming to make diffusion models more efficient and faster to train.

Method: Careful selection of noise schedules to enable training with significantly fewer latent states (down to T~32), and developing completely disentangled models using single latent-state models that can be combined for generation.

Result: Demonstrated that models trained with only 32 latent states match performance of models with 1000 states, and single latent-state models can generate high-quality samples when combined, achieving 4-6x faster convergence across various metrics on two datasets.

Conclusion: Diffusion models do not require a large number of latent states when proper noise schedules are used, and complete disentanglement in T-space enables efficient training with single latent-state models that can be combined for effective generation.

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

*Haoru Tan,Sitong Wu,Xiuzhe Wu,Wang Wang,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Gui-Song Xia,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diff-In: A scalable second-order method for approximating sample influence in neural networks without convexity assumptions, achieving high accuracy with computational efficiency comparable to first-order methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data analysis tools for AI model training are inaccurate and often assume convex loss functions, which doesn't hold for neural networks, making current methods challenging to implement effectively.

Method: Proposes Diff-In formulation that approximates sample influence by accumulating differences between consecutive learning steps using second-order approximations, eliminating convexity requirements while maintaining computational efficiency through Hessian-gradient product approximation.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows significantly lower approximation error than existing influence estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance in data cleaning, deletion, and coreset selection across multiple benchmarks, scaling to millions of data points in large-scale vision-language pre-training.

Conclusion: Diff-In provides an accurate, scalable, and computationally efficient approach for sample influence estimation in neural networks, overcoming limitations of existing methods that require convexity assumptions.

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

*Jyotirmai Singh,Samar Khanna,James Burgess*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM) introduce anisotropic noise scaling along data principal components, improving FID by up to 15% on image datasets without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise that ignores data structure. Inspired by quantum squeezed states and Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the authors hypothesize that data-dependent noise scaling can better help models learn important features.

Method: Two configurations: (1) Heisenberg diffusion model that compensates principal axis scaling with inverse scaling on orthogonal directions, and (2) standard SDM that scales only the principal axis. They apply mild antisqueezing (increasing variance on principal axis).

Result: On CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64, mild antisqueezing consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts precision-recall frontier toward higher recall.

Conclusion: Simple data-aware noise shaping can deliver robust generative performance improvements without requiring architectural modifications to diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

### [123] [Two Birds with One Stone: Multi-Task Detection and Attribution of LLM-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14190)
*Zixin Rao,Youssef Mohamed,Shang Liu,Zeyan Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DA-MTL is a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously performs AI-generated text detection and LLM authorship attribution across multiple languages, showing strong performance and robustness against adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI text detection methods focus mainly on English and distinguish human vs AI content, but lack attention to authorship attribution (identifying which specific LLM generated text) which is crucial for forensic analysis.

Method: Multi-task learning framework that captures unique characteristics of both text detection and authorship attribution tasks while sharing insights between them, evaluated on 9 datasets and 4 backbone models across multiple languages.

Result: Demonstrates strong performance across multiple languages and LLM sources, with thorough analysis of cross-modal and cross-lingual patterns, and shows robustness against adversarial obfuscation techniques.

Conclusion: The framework provides valuable insights into LLM behavior and improves generalization for both detection and authorship attribution tasks, addressing an important gap in LLM forensic analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have demonstrated
remarkable abilities in generating natural language. However, they also pose
security and integrity challenges. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on
distinguishing AI-generated content from human-written text, with most
solutions tailored for English. Meanwhile, authorship attribution--determining
which specific LLM produced a given text--has received comparatively little
attention despite its importance in forensic analysis. In this paper, we
present DA-MTL, a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously addresses
both text detection and authorship attribution. We evaluate DA-MTL on nine
datasets and four backbone models, demonstrating its strong performance across
multiple languages and LLM sources. Our framework captures each task's unique
characteristics and shares insights between them, which boosts performance in
both tasks. Additionally, we conduct a thorough analysis of cross-modal and
cross-lingual patterns and assess the framework's robustness against
adversarial obfuscation techniques. Our findings offer valuable insights into
LLM behavior and the generalization of both detection and authorship
attribution.

### [124] [MultiFuzz: A Dense Retrieval-based Multi-Agent System for Network Protocol Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14300)
*Youssef Maklad,Fares Wael,Ali Hamdi,Wael Elsersy,Khaled Shaban*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: MultiFuzz is a multi-agent system that uses dense retrieval and RAG to improve protocol fuzzing by leveraging protocol documentation, overcoming limitations of traditional fuzzers and LLM-based approaches like ChatAFL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional protocol fuzzers lack semantic understanding of complex protocols, and recent LLM-based approaches like ChatAFL suffer from unreliable outputs, hallucinations, and assumptions about protocol knowledge.

Method: Uses dense retrieval to build embeddings from protocol documentation (RFCs) in a vector database for RAG pipeline. Employs specialized agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically adapt fuzzing strategies based on retrieved contextual knowledge.

Result: Experimental evaluation on RTSP protocol shows MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper protocol states/transitions compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers (NSFuzz, AFLNet, ChatAFL).

Conclusion: MultiFuzz establishes a new paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing by combining dense retrieval, agentic coordination, and language model reasoning, providing a scalable foundation for intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

Abstract: Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based
systems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of
complex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works,
such as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol
fuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider
exploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like
unreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about
protocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense
retrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by
integrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and
structured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of
protocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database
for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to
generate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating
protocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic
constraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups
of agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically
adapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.
Experimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate
that MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper
protocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as
NSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic
coordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new
paradigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible
foundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.

*Pengcheng Wang,Sheng Li,Takahiro Shinozaki*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: RAG-Boost enhances ASR systems by integrating retrieval-augmented generation to fix recognition errors in real-time using audio-text pairs and domain terms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems by addressing recognition errors through dynamic retrieval of relevant audio-text data during the recognition process.

Method: The system uses a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module that queries a vector store of audio-text pairs and domain terms with partial ASR hypotheses. Retrieved results are fused with live ASR hypotheses and processed by an LLM to correct errors.

Result: The approach yields improved ASR responses by dynamically correcting recognition errors through contextual retrieval and fusion.

Conclusion: RAG-Boost effectively enhances LLM-based ASR systems by leveraging real-time retrieval and fusion to improve accuracy and reduce errors.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RAG-Boost (ST-ShinozakiLab Task I system), which
enhances the baseline LLM-based ASR system of the MLC-SLM Challenge (task I)
with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module on the fly. Each partial ASR
hypothesis queries a vector store of audio-text pairs and domain terms, and the
retrieved results are fused with the live ASR hypotheses to fix recognition
errors. The fused hypotheses are passed to the LLM, yielding improved
responses.

TL;DR: MahaTTS-v2 is a multilingual TTS system focused on Indic languages, trained on 20K hours of Indian language data using Wav2Vec2.0 tokens and conditional flow models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS models primarily focus on English and European languages, limiting access to information for speakers of Indic languages. This creates a need for multilingual TTS systems that can serve diverse language communities.

Method: The system uses Wav2Vec2.0 tokens for semantic extraction, a Language Model for text-to-semantic modeling, and a Conditional Flow Model for semantics to melspectrogram generation.

Result: Experimental results show the proposed approach is effective and outperforms other frameworks in multilingual expressive capabilities for Indic languages.

Conclusion: MahaTTS-v2 successfully addresses the multilingual challenge in TTS by providing excellent expressive capabilities for Indic languages, making information more accessible to diverse language communities.

Abstract: Current Text-to-Speech models pose a multilingual challenge, where most of
the models traditionally focus on English and European languages, thereby
hurting the potential to provide access to information to many more people. To
address this gap, we introduce MahaTTS-v2 a Multilingual Multi-speaker
Text-To-Speech (TTS) system that has excellent multilingual expressive
capabilities in Indic languages. The model has been trained on around 20K hours
of data specifically focused on Indian languages. Our approach leverages
Wav2Vec2.0 tokens for semantic extraction, and a Language Model (LM) for
text-to-semantic modeling. Additionally, we have used a Conditional Flow Model
(CFM) for semantics to melspectogram generation. The experimental results
indicate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over other frameworks. Our

TL;DR: PET-DPC is a conditional diffusion model with posterior physical correction that achieves fast, quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction while reducing artifacts and improving generalization to out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based PET reconstruction methods face challenges with quantitative accuracy, artifacts, limited interpretability, data dependence, and overfitting risks, which hinder clinical adoption.

Method: Proposes PET-DPC - a conditional diffusion model with posterior physical correction. Uses innovative normalization to generate GTP-image input, incorporates physical information during diffusion sampling for scatter, attenuation, and random corrections.

Result: Outperformed end-to-end deep learning models in quantitative metrics, sometimes surpassed traditional iterative methods, reduced reconstruction time by 50% for brain and 85% for whole-body scans, preserved background uniformity, and accurately reproduced tumor-to-background ratios.

Conclusion: PET-DPC is a promising approach for rapid, quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction with strong potential to improve clinical imaging workflows and overcome limitations of current deep learning methods.

Abstract: Deep learning-based reconstruction of positron emission tomography(PET) data
has gained increasing attention in recent years. While these methods achieve
fast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the
presence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven
dependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical
adoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with
posterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An
innovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF
Probabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated
during the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior
scatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated
on 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated
brain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully
corrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in
quantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative
methods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data.
Compared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for
brain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the
critical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation
corrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy. Experiments with physical
phantoms further demonstrated PET-DPC's ability to preserve background
uniformity and accurately reproduce tumor-to-background intensity ratios.
Overall,these results highlight PET-DPC as a promising approach for rapid,
quantitatively accurate PET reconstruction,with strong potential to improve
clinical imaging workflows.

### [128] [FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14052)
*Chanyeol Choi,Jihoon Kwon,Alejandro Lopez-Lira,Chaewoon Kim,Minjae Kim,Juneha Hwang,Jaeseon Ha,Hojun Choi,Suyeol Yun,Yongjin Kim,Yongjae Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: FinAgentBench is the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating multi-step reasoning retrieval (agentic retrieval) in finance, featuring 3,429 expert-annotated examples from S&P-100 companies to assess LLM agents' ability to identify relevant document types and pinpoint key passages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional IR methods fall short in financial domain retrieval accuracy, requiring both semantic understanding and fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain knowledge. No existing benchmark evaluates multi-step reasoning retrieval capabilities in finance.

Method: Created FinAgentBench with 3,429 expert-annotated examples from S&P-100 companies, designed to separate two reasoning steps: document type identification and key passage pinpointing within selected documents to address context limitations.

Result: The benchmark provides quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrates that targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance in financial contexts.

Conclusion: FinAgentBench establishes a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex financial tasks and will be publicly released, with plans to expand to full S&P 500 and beyond.

Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain,
where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of
documents. Traditional IR methods-whether sparse or dense-often fall short in
retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but
also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and
domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have
opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the
model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is
most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate
such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce
FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with
multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The
benchmark consists of 3,429 expert-annotated examples on S&P-100 listed firms
and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document
type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected
document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning
steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a
quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance.
We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how
targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance.
Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior
in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance. We will release the dataset
publicly upon acceptance of the paper and plan to expand and share dataset for
the full S&P 500 and beyond.

*Surajit Das,Gourav Roy,Pavel Zun*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: A CNN-based pipeline for segmenting unstained live cells in bright-field microscopy that addresses challenges like low contrast, noise, and motion blur, achieving 93% accuracy and strong generalization to phase-contrast images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing segmentation methods don't consistently handle the unique challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging including temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from cellular movement in high-throughput settings.

Method: Developed a low-cost CNN-based pipeline using frozen encoders within a U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems, adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates, progressive mechanisms to prevent overfitting, and ensemble techniques.

Result: Achieved 93% test accuracy and 89% average F1-score on challenging low-contrast, noisy, and blurry images. Demonstrated strong generalization to phase-contrast LIVECell dataset despite minimal training exposure (<10%), showing modality robustness.

Conclusion: The pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision for bright-field microscopy segmentation, requires minimal compute power, is adaptable using basic deep learning setups, and shows strong potential for real-world laboratory deployment across various imaging conditions.

Abstract: Live cell culture is crucial in biomedical studies for analyzing cell
properties and dynamics in vitro. This study focuses on segmenting unstained
live cells imaged with bright-field microscopy. While many segmentation
approaches exist for microscopic images, none consistently address the
challenges of bright-field live-cell imaging with high throughput, where
temporal phenotype changes, low contrast, noise, and motion-induced blur from
cellular movement remain major obstacles. We developed a low-cost CNN-based
pipeline incorporating comparative analysis of frozen encoders within a unified
U-Net architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms, instance-aware systems,
adaptive loss functions, hard instance retraining, dynamic learning rates,
progressive mechanisms to mitigate overfitting, and an ensemble technique. The
model was validated on a public dataset featuring diverse live cell variants,
showing consistent competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods, achieving 93%
test accuracy and an average F1-score of 89% (std. 0.07) on low-contrast,
noisy, and blurry images. Notably, the model was trained primarily on
bright-field images with limited exposure to phase-contrast microscopy (<10%),
yet it generalized effectively to the phase-contrast LIVECell dataset,
demonstrating modality, robustness and strong performance. This highlights its
potential for real-world laboratory deployment across imaging conditions. The
model requires minimal compute power and is adaptable using basic deep learning
setups such as Google Colab, making it practical for training on other cell
variants. Our pipeline outperforms existing methods in robustness and precision
for bright-field microscopy segmentation. The code and dataset are available
for reproducibility

*Luca Annese,Sabrina Patania,Silvia Serino,Tom Foulsham,Silvia Rossi,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Structured examples from planner solution graphs don't consistently improve LLM-based agents' perspective-taking in ReAct framework, showing limitations in mentalizing about occluded spaces and epistemic costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance perspective-taking capabilities of LLM-based agents through structured examples derived from planning solutions, addressing challenges in active perception and collaborative reasoning.

Method: Proposed a solution-processing pipeline generating three example types (G-type goal paths, E-type node paths, L-type decision sequences) converted into thought-action examples via LLM prompting, tested within ReAct framework.

Result: L-type examples slightly reduced clarification requests and action steps but no consistent improvements; agents succeeded in basic attentional filtering but struggled with occluded spaces and epistemic cost evaluation.

Conclusion: Structured examples alone are insufficient for robust perspective-taking, requiring explicit belief tracking, cost modeling, and richer environments for socially grounded collaboration in LLM agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and reasoning frameworks have
opened new possibilities for improving the perspective -taking capabilities of
autonomous agents. However, tasks that involve active perception, collaborative
reasoning, and perspective taking (understanding what another agent can see or
knows) pose persistent challenges for current LLM-based systems. This study
investigates the potential of structured examples derived from transformed
solution graphs generated by the Fast Downward planner to improve the
performance of LLM-based agents within a ReAct framework. We propose a
structured solution-processing pipeline that generates three distinct
categories of examples: optimal goal paths (G-type), informative node paths
(E-type), and step-by-step optimal decision sequences contrasting alternative
actions (L-type). These solutions are further converted into ``thought-action''
examples by prompting an LLM to explicitly articulate the reasoning behind each
decision. While L-type examples slightly reduce clarification requests and
overall action steps, they do not yield consistent improvements. Agents are
successful in tasks requiring basic attentional filtering but struggle in
scenarios that required mentalising about occluded spaces or weighing the costs
of epistemic actions. These findings suggest that structured examples alone are
insufficient for robust perspective-taking, underscoring the need for explicit
belief tracking, cost modelling, and richer environments to enable socially
grounded collaboration in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: MCP-Universe is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic tasks through interaction with MCP servers, revealing significant performance limitations in even state-of-the-art models across 6 core domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too simplistic and fail to capture real application challenges like long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces in MCP (Model Context Protocol) environments.

Method: Developed MCP-Universe benchmark with 6 domains spanning 11 MCP servers, implementing execution-based evaluators including format evaluators, static evaluators, and dynamic evaluators that retrieve real-time ground truth.

Result: Even SOTA models show significant limitations: GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%), Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%). Benchmark reveals long-context and unknown-tools challenges, with enterprise agents performing no better than standard ReAct frameworks.

Conclusion: The benchmark exposes critical gaps in current LLM capabilities for real-world MCP interactions and provides an open-source extensible framework to foster innovation in the MCP ecosystem.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol has emerged as a transformative standard for
connecting large language models to external data sources and tools, rapidly
gaining adoption across major AI providers and development platforms. However,
existing benchmarks are overly simplistic and fail to capture real application
challenges such as long-horizon reasoning and large, unfamiliar tool spaces. To
address this critical gap, we introduce MCP-Universe, the first comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic and hard tasks
through interaction with real-world MCP servers. Our benchmark encompasses 6
core domains spanning 11 different MCP servers: Location Navigation, Repository
Management, Financial Analysis, 3D Design, Browser Automation, and Web
Searching. To ensure rigorous evaluation, we implement execution-based
evaluators, including format evaluators for agent format compliance, static
evaluators for time-invariant content matching, and dynamic evaluators that
automatically retrieve real-time ground truth for temporally sensitive tasks.
Through extensive evaluation of leading LLMs, we find that even SOTA models
such as GPT-5 (43.72%), Grok-4 (33.33%) and Claude-4.0-Sonnet (29.44%) exhibit
significant performance limitations. In addition, our benchmark poses a
significant long-context challenge for LLM agents, as the number of input
tokens increases rapidly with the number of interaction steps. Moreover, it
introduces an unknown-tools challenge, as LLM agents often lack familiarity
with the precise usage of the MCP servers. Notably, enterprise-level agents
like Cursor cannot achieve better performance than standard ReAct frameworks.
Beyond evaluation, we open-source our extensible evaluation framework with UI
support, enabling researchers and practitioners to seamlessly integrate new
agents and MCP servers while fostering innovation in the rapidly evolving MCP
ecosystem.

*Siyuan Song,Harvey Lederman,Jennifer Hu,Kyle Mahowald*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper argues for a thicker definition of AI introspection, proposing that true introspection requires processes more reliable than what external observers can achieve at equal or lower computational cost. Through experiments with LLMs reasoning about temperature parameters, the authors show models can appear to have lightweight introspection while failing meaningful introspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no consensus on how to define introspection in AI models, and existing lightweight definitions may not capture meaningful introspection capabilities. The authors aim to establish a more robust definition that distinguishes true introspection from superficial capabilities.

Method: The authors propose a new definition of AI introspection as processes yielding information about internal states through methods more reliable than those available to third parties at equal or lower computational cost. They conduct experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature parameters to test this definition.

Result: Experiments show that LLMs can appear to have lightweight introspection capabilities but fail to demonstrate meaningful introspection according to the authors' proposed thicker definition, suggesting current models lack true introspective abilities.

Conclusion: The paper concludes that a thicker definition of introspection is necessary to properly evaluate AI capabilities, and that current LLMs demonstrate only superficial introspection rather than the meaningful internal state awareness that the proposed definition requires.

Abstract: Whether AI models can introspect is an increasingly important practical
question. But there is no consensus on how introspection is to be defined.
Beginning from a recently proposed ''lightweight'' definition, we argue instead
for a thicker one. According to our proposal, introspection in AI is any
process which yields information about internal states through a process more
reliable than one with equal or lower computational cost available to a third
party. Using experiments where LLMs reason about their internal temperature
parameters, we show they can appear to have lightweight introspection while
failing to meaningfully introspect per our proposed definition.

TL;DR: OmniSense is an edge-assisted framework for real-time 360° video analytics that achieves both low latency and high accuracy through spherical region of interest prediction and smart model scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the proliferation of 360° videos and extended reality applications, there's a need for advanced video analytics that can extract insights from immersive videos without blind spots, while overcoming significant computation and network resource challenges.

Method: OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI) prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in 360° frames, and incorporates video content and network dynamics to smartly scale vision models for optimized resource utilization.

Result: Extensive evaluation shows OmniSense improves accuracy by 19.8% - 114.6% with similar end-to-end latencies compared to baselines, and achieves 2.0× - 2.4× speedups while maintaining accuracy on par with the highest accuracy baselines.

Conclusion: OmniSense successfully addresses the computational and network challenges of 360° video analytics, delivering both high accuracy and low latency through intelligent region prediction and resource-aware model scaling.

Abstract: With the reduced hardware costs of omnidirectional cameras and the
proliferation of various extended reality applications, more and more
$360^\circ$ videos are being captured. To fully unleash their potential,
advanced video analytics is expected to extract actionable insights and
situational knowledge without blind spots from the videos. In this paper, we
present OmniSense, a novel edge-assisted framework for online immersive video
analytics. OmniSense achieves both low latency and high accuracy, combating the
significant computation and network resource challenges of analyzing
$360^\circ$ videos. Motivated by our measurement insights into $360^\circ$
videos, OmniSense introduces a lightweight spherical region of interest (SRoI)
prediction algorithm to prune redundant information in $360^\circ$ frames.
Incorporating the video content and network dynamics, it then smartly scales
vision models to analyze the predicted SRoIs with optimized resource
utilization. We implement a prototype of OmniSense with commodity devices and
evaluate it on diverse real-world collected $360^\circ$ videos. Extensive
evaluation results show that compared to resource-agnostic baselines, it
improves the accuracy by $19.8\%$ -- $114.6\%$ with similar end-to-end
latencies. Meanwhile, it hits $2.0\times$ -- $2.4\times$ speedups while keeping
the accuracy on par with the highest accuracy of baselines.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a practical definition for hallucinations in medical AI devices as plausible errors that can be either impactful or benign, aiming to standardize evaluation across different medical device areas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning and data-based medical devices frequently produce errors that are often vaguely described as 'hallucinations', creating a need for a standardized definition to facilitate proper evaluation and mitigation across different medical device domains.

Method: The authors draw from theoretical developments and empirical studies across multiple medical device areas to introduce a universal definition of hallucinations as plausible errors that can be either impactful or benign to clinical tasks.

Result: The paper provides a practical definition that can be applied to both imaging and non-imaging medical applications, and explores how this definition relates to existing evaluation methodologies for medical devices.

Conclusion: The proposed definition aims to standardize the evaluation of hallucinations in medical AI systems and discusses existing approaches for minimizing their prevalence, facilitating better assessment and improvement of medical device reliability across different product areas.

Abstract: Computer methods in medical devices are frequently imperfect and are known to
produce errors in clinical or diagnostic tasks. However, when deep learning and
data-based approaches yield output that exhibit errors, the devices are
frequently said to hallucinate. Drawing from theoretical developments and
empirical studies in multiple medical device areas, we introduce a practical
and universal definition that denotes hallucinations as a type of error that is
plausible and can be either impactful or benign to the task at hand. The
definition aims at facilitating the evaluation of medical devices that suffer
from hallucinations across product areas. Using examples from imaging and
non-imaging applications, we explore how the proposed definition relates to
evaluation methodologies and discuss existing approaches for minimizing the
prevalence of hallucinations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models show great generative capabilities but have limited applications in 3D medical imaging, particularly cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac anatomies is crucial for in silico trials, computer simulations, and data augmentation for machine learning models.

Method: Proposed MeshLDM - a novel Latent Diffusion Model architecture specifically designed for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. Applied to a dataset of 3D left ventricular meshes from patients with acute myocardial infarction.

Result: Successfully captures characteristics of cardiac shapes at both end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction) phases. Generated meshes show only 2.4% difference in population mean compared to the gold standard.

Conclusion: MeshLDM demonstrates effective application of diffusion models for 3D cardiac mesh generation, providing a valuable tool for medical research applications requiring realistic cardiac anatomy synthesis.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently gained immense interest for their generative
capabilities, specifically the high quality and diversity of the synthesized
data. However, examples of their applications in 3D medical imaging are still
scarce, especially in cardiology. Generating diverse realistic cardiac
anatomies is crucial for applications such as in silico trials,
electromechanical computer simulations, or data augmentations for machine
learning models. In this work, we investigate the application of Latent
Diffusion Models (LDMs) for generating 3D meshes of human cardiac anatomies. To
this end, we propose a novel LDM architecture -- MeshLDM. We apply the proposed
model on a dataset of 3D meshes of left ventricular cardiac anatomies from
patients with acute myocardial infarction and evaluate its performance in terms
of both qualitative and quantitative clinical and 3D mesh reconstruction
metrics. The proposed MeshLDM successfully captures characteristics of the
cardiac shapes at end-diastolic (relaxation) and end-systolic (contraction)
cardiac phases, generating meshes with a 2.4% difference in population mean
compared to the gold standard.

TL;DR: Deep learning-based nnU-Net method for automated segmentation of hepatic anatomy from MRI, achieving high accuracy for liver structures and enabling efficient 3D surgical planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy from MRI to ease clinical workflow of preoperative planning for liver surgery.

Method: Used nnU-Net v1 trained on 72 patients' manual segmentations with focus on thin structures and topography preservation, evaluated on 18-patient test set using Dice similarity coefficient.

Result: Achieved high DSCs: 0.97 for parenchyma, 0.80 for hepatic vein, 0.79 for biliary tree, 0.77 for tumors, 0.74 for portal vein. Model detected additional tumors missed by radiologists.

Conclusion: The nnU-Net-based method enables accurate automated delineation of hepatic anatomy, making 3D planning efficient as standard-of-care for liver surgery patients.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a deep
learning-based automated segmentation method for hepatic anatomy (i.e.,
parenchyma, tumors, portal vein, hepatic vein and biliary tree) from the
hepatobiliary phase of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. This method should ease the
clinical workflow of preoperative planning.
  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans
from 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020
and October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72
patients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.
Performance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and
manual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following
clinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated
using the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required
adjustments using DSC.
  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma,
0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for
tumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was
76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment
dataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D
models, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01)
and hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater
variability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model
detected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.
  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate
and automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be
applied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver
surgery.

TL;DR: Deep learning evaluation for knee MRI ROI detection, showing ResNet50 outperforms Vision Transformers, with Grad-CAM providing best clinical explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual MRI interpretation is time-consuming and subjective, requiring automated ROI detection with explainable AI for clinical adoption.

Method: Evaluated ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers, and U-Net variants with MLP classifiers, using Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps for explainability on MRNet dataset.

Result: ResNet50 excelled in classification and ROI identification, outperforming transformer models. Grad-CAM provided most clinically meaningful explanations. U-Net+MLP showed potential but lower classification performance.

Conclusion: CNN-based transfer learning is most effective for this dataset. Future work with larger-scale pretraining may better utilize transformer models' potential.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an essential diagnostic tool for
assessing knee injuries. However, manual interpretation of MRI slices remains
time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study presents a
systematic evaluation of various deep learning architectures combined with
explainable AI (xAI) techniques for automated region of interest (ROI)
detection in knee MRI scans. We investigate both supervised and self-supervised
approaches, including ResNet50, InceptionV3, Vision Transformers (ViT), and
multiple U-Net variants augmented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
classifiers. To enhance interpretability and clinical relevance, we integrate
xAI methods such as Grad-CAM and Saliency Maps. Model performance is assessed
using AUC for classification and PSNR/SSIM for reconstruction quality, along
with qualitative ROI visualizations. Our results demonstrate that ResNet50
consistently excels in classification and ROI identification, outperforming
transformer-based models under the constraints of the MRNet dataset. While
hybrid U-Net + MLP approaches show potential for leveraging spatial features in
reconstruction and interpretability, their classification performance remains
lower. Grad-CAM consistently provided the most clinically meaningful
explanations across architectures. Overall, CNN-based transfer learning emerges
as the most effective approach for this dataset, while future work with
larger-scale pretraining may better unlock the potential of transformer models.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FGRestore, the first fine-grained image quality assessment dataset for image restoration tasks, and proposes FGResQ, a new IQA model that outperforms existing metrics by combining coarse-grained score regression with fine-grained quality ranking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are inadequate for image restoration tasks, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained quality differences among restored images, creating a need for more accurate evaluation methods.

Method: Created FGRestore dataset with 18,408 restored images across six IR tasks and 30,886 pairwise preferences. Proposed FGResQ model that performs both coarse-grained score regression and fine-grained quality ranking specifically for image restoration.

Result: Comprehensive benchmarking revealed significant inconsistencies between existing IQA metrics and fine-grained restoration quality. FGResQ significantly outperformed state-of-the-art IQA metrics in extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The study addresses the critical need for accurate IQA in image restoration by providing both a comprehensive benchmark dataset and a novel model that effectively captures both coarse and fine-grained quality aspects, advancing the field of perceptual image restoration evaluation.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable achievements in perceptual image
restoration (IR), creating an urgent demand for accurate image quality
assessment (IQA), which is essential for both performance comparison and
algorithm optimization. Unfortunately, the existing IQA metrics exhibit
inherent weakness for IR task, particularly when distinguishing fine-grained
quality differences among restored images. To address this dilemma, we
contribute the first-of-its-kind fine-grained image quality assessment dataset
for image restoration, termed FGRestore, comprising 18,408 restored images
across six common IR tasks. Beyond conventional scalar quality scores,
FGRestore was also annotated with 30,886 fine-grained pairwise preferences.
Based on FGRestore, a comprehensive benchmark was conducted on the existing IQA
metrics, which reveal significant inconsistencies between score-based IQA
evaluations and the fine-grained restoration quality. Motivated by these
findings, we further propose FGResQ, a new IQA model specifically designed for
image restoration, which features both coarse-grained score regression and
fine-grained quality ranking. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate
that FGResQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA metrics. Codes and
model weights have been released in https://pxf0429.github.io/FGResQ/

Method: Integrates transformer module into encoder-decoder framework to capture global semantics while retaining convolutional branch for local features. Adds boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path for better boundary localization.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc metrics. Shows superior boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex scenarios with strong robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed model is well-suited for automated skin lesion segmentation tasks, demonstrating high accuracy and effectiveness in handling complex lesion analysis demands.

Abstract: This paper proposes a high-precision semantic segmentation method based on an
improved TransUNet architecture to address the challenges of complex lesion
structures, blurred boundaries, and significant scale variations in skin lesion
images. The method integrates a transformer module into the traditional
encoder-decoder framework to model global semantic information, while retaining
a convolutional branch to preserve local texture and edge features. This
enhances the model's ability to perceive fine-grained structures. A
boundary-guided attention mechanism and multi-scale upsampling path are also
designed to improve lesion boundary localization and segmentation consistency.
To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a series of experiments were
conducted, including comparative studies, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis,
data augmentation effects, input resolution variation, and training data split
ratio tests. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms
existing representative methods in mIoU, mDice, and mAcc, demonstrating
stronger lesion recognition accuracy and robustness. In particular, the model
achieves better boundary reconstruction and structural recovery in complex
scenarios, making it well-suited for the key demands of automated segmentation
tasks in skin lesion analysis.

Motivation: Overcome limitations of specialized hardware and restrictive protocols in volumetric ultrasound to enable widespread adoption and improve diagnostic accuracy.

Method: Adapt Gaussian Splatting to ultrasound with slice-aware differentiable rasterizer, modeling anatomy as anisotropic 3D Gaussians optimized from image-level supervision using sensorless probe motion estimation and geometric priors.

Result: Compact, flexible, memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity from 2D ultrasound images.

Conclusion: Accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound can be achieved computationally, offering scalable alternative to conventional 3D systems and enabling AI-assisted analysis.

Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic
accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains
limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition
protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for
reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal
ultrasound (TVS) sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose
estimators. Our method adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the
domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer
tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model
anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their
parameters directly from image-level supervision, leveraging sensorless probe
motion estimation and domain-specific geometric priors. The result is a
compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures
anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that
accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through
purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D
systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.

TL;DR: Virtual multiplex staining framework using latent diffusion models to generate multiplex biomarker images from H&E images, enabling up to 18 marker types with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the complexity and cost limitations of multiplex imaging while leveraging existing H&E image repositories that lack corresponding multiplex data, enabling multimodal analysis and retrospective studies.

Method: Utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models (LDMs) with conditional diffusion modeling for marker-by-marker generation, fine-tuned for single-step sampling with pixel-level loss functions to handle varying pixel value distributions and improve inference speed.

Result: Validated on two publicly available datasets, the framework successfully generates up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, significantly exceeding previous approaches that only achieved 2-3 marker types.

Conclusion: The framework bridges the gap between H&E and multiplex imaging, enabling virtual multiplex staining that can facilitate retrospective studies and large-scale analyses of existing H&E image repositories with molecular-level insights.

Abstract: Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous
visualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing
molecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
cannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition
have hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large
repositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting
opportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage
recent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling
complex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a
target domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual
multiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate
multiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our
approach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion
model on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers.
To tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different
marker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for
single-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference
efficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two
publicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in
generating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a
substantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches.
This validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual
multiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and
multiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale
analyses of existing H&E image repositories.

Result: Created anatomically meaningful landmarks that serve as boundary conditions and force application points (muscle/ligament insertions) for biomechanical models, enabling subject-specific spinal mechanics simulation.

Conclusion: The method successfully bridges medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation, contributing to digital twin ecosystem development for personalized healthcare applications while being radiation-free and scalable.

Abstract: Digital twins offer a powerful framework for subject-specific simulation and
clinical decision support, yet their development often hinges on accurate,
individualized anatomical modeling. In this work, we present a rule-based
approach for subpixel-accurate key-point extraction from MRI, adapted from
prior CT-based methods. Our approach incorporates robust image alignment and
vertebra-specific orientation estimation to generate anatomically meaningful
landmarks that serve as boundary conditions and force application points, like
muscle and ligament insertions in biomechanical models. These models enable the
simulation of spinal mechanics considering the subject's individual anatomy,
and thus support the development of tailored approaches in clinical diagnostics
and treatment planning. By leveraging MR imaging, our method is radiation-free
and well-suited for large-scale studies and use in underrepresented
populations. This work contributes to the digital twin ecosystem by bridging
the gap between precise medical image analysis with biomechanical simulation,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of public real-world datasets for display-camera imaging systems hinders development and evaluation of display-based inverse rendering methods, despite the unique advantages of programmable pixel light sources and polarized light for diffuse-specular separation.

Method: Constructed and calibrated an imaging system with LCD display and stereo polarization cameras, captured diverse objects under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns, and provided high-quality ground-truth geometry.

Result: Dataset enables synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different noise levels. The proposed baseline method outperforms state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods.

Conclusion: This work provides the first comprehensive real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering, facilitating future research and evaluation in this domain while demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured
images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:
each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the
polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular
separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world
dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as
light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of
display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first
real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we
construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo
polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse
geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We
also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the
synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different
noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing
photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet
effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming
state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on

Method: Develop comprehensive Blender Python APIs for complex geometries, create large-scale paired object-code dataset with semantic part decomposition, train multimodal LLM to translate 3D point clouds into executable Blender scripts.

Result: Superior performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks, enables intuitive geometric and topological editing through code modifications, enhances LLM reasoning capabilities for 3D shape understanding.

Conclusion: MeshCoder provides a powerful and flexible solution for programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding, overcoming limitations of previous approaches.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

TL;DR: A method for reconstructing 3D human bodies from just front and back view images using geometry reconstruction and enhancement algorithms to achieve fast, high-quality results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable users to easily create 3D digital humans by lowering the barrier through sparse input (only two images) and reducing requirements for data collection equipment.

Method: Redesigned geometry reconstruction model based on foundation models to predict consistent point clouds from sparse views, plus enhancement algorithm to supplement missing color information, then converted to 3D Gaussians for rendering.

Result: Achieves entire human reconstruction in 190ms on single RTX 4090 with 1024x1024 images, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on THuman2.0 and cross-domain datasets, works with low-cost mobile devices.

Conclusion: The method successfully reconstructs 3D human bodies from extremely sparse two-view inputs with fast computation and high quality, making 3D digital human creation more accessible.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic,
which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose
a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only
two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier
for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the
difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from
the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on
foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input
images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an
enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,
and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are
directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.
Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on
a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain
datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with
images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data
collection. Demos and code are available at

TL;DR: Proposes AST-based structural entropy metrics for assessing code generation stability in LLMs without requiring reference code or execution


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for reliable stability assessment of LLM-generated code to judge real-world development reliability, extending structural entropy concepts to programming domain

Method: Uses abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis with depth-bounded subtrees, measuring stability via Jensen-Shannon divergence and Structural Cross-Entropy ratio, with structural-only and token-aware variants

Result: Provides reference-free, language-agnostic metrics that reveal nuances in model consistency and robustness, benchmarking several leading LLMs on standard code generation tasks

Conclusion: AST-driven structural entropy offers lightweight, execution-independent stability assessment that complements existing evaluation metrics like pass@k and BLEU

Abstract: Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs)
is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend
prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy
with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the
multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat
their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure
stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a
symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural
Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both
metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views
on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or
CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and
execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code
generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals
nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time
with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation
evaluation toolkit.

Conclusion: The study provides initial neurobiological insights into prompt engineering proficiency, with implications for designing better human-AI interfaces and understanding cognitive workflows in LLM interaction.

Abstract: Prompt engineering has rapidly emerged as a critical skill for effective
interaction with large language models (LLMs). However, the cognitive and
neural underpinnings of this expertise remain largely unexplored. This paper
presents findings from a cross-sectional pilot fMRI study investigating
differences in brain functional connectivity and network activity between
experts and intermediate prompt engineers. Our results reveal distinct neural
signatures associated with higher prompt engineering literacy, including
increased functional connectivity in brain regions such as the left middle
temporal gyrus and the left frontal pole, as well as altered power-frequency
dynamics in key cognitive networks. These findings offer initial insights into
the neurobiological basis of prompt engineering proficiency. We discuss the
implications of these neurocognitive markers in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Understanding the neural basis of human expertise in interacting with
LLMs can inform the design of more intuitive human-AI interfaces, contribute to
cognitive models of LLM interaction, and potentially guide the development of
AI systems that better align with human cognitive workflows. This
interdisciplinary approach aims to bridge the gap between human cognition and
machine intelligence, fostering a deeper understanding of how humans learn and
adapt to complex AI systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-density EEG arrays cause cross-channel interference and computational overhead. Existing channel selection methods are task-specific and require re-optimization for each application, limiting their practical utility.

Method: Activity Coefficient-based Channel Selection (ACCS) uses a novel Channel Activity Coefficient (CAC) metric to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. Selects top 16 channels ranked by CAC.

Result: Achieves up to 34.97% improvement in multi-class classification accuracy compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent of downstream tasks or models, making it highly adaptable for diverse EEG-based applications without requiring re-optimization.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have gained widespread adoption in
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications due to their non-invasive,
low-cost, and relatively simple acquisition process. The demand for higher
spatial resolution, particularly in clinical settings, has led to the
development of high-density electrode arrays. However, increasing the number of
channels introduces challenges such as cross-channel interference and
computational overhead. To address these issues, modern BCI systems often
employ channel selection algorithms. Existing methods, however, are typically
task-specific and require re-optimization for each new application. This work
proposes a task-agnostic channel selection method, Activity Coefficient-based
Channel Selection (ACCS), which uses a novel metric called the Channel Activity
Coefficient (CAC) to quantify channel utility based on activity levels. By
selecting the top 16 channels ranked by CAC, ACCS achieves up to 34.97%
improvement in multi-class classification accuracy. Unlike traditional
approaches, ACCS identifies a reusable set of informative channels independent
of the downstream task or model, making it highly adaptable for diverse
EEG-based applications.
