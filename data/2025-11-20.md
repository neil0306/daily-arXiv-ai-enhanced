<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive accuracy of pretrained large language models by leveraging additional computational resources at inference time rather than just during training.

Method: Categorizes test-time scaling methods based on how problems are decomposed into subproblems and their topological organization (sequential, parallel, or tree-structured).

Result: Unifies diverse approaches like Chain-of-Thought, Branch-Solve-Merge, and Tree-of-Thought under a common framework and synthesizes existing analyses of their strengths and weaknesses.

Conclusion: Outlines promising directions for future research in test-time scaling methods for enhancing LLM performance.

Abstract: With this paper, we survey techniques for improving the predictive accuracy of pretrained large language models by allocating additional compute at inference time. In categorizing test-time scaling methods, we place special emphasis on how a problem is decomposed into subproblems and on the topological organization of these subproblems whether sequential, parallel, or tree-structured. This perspective allows us to unify diverse approaches such as Chain-of-Thought, Branch-Solve-Merge, and Tree-of-Thought under a common lens. We further synthesize existing analyses of these techniques, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses, and conclude by outlining promising directions for future research

### [2] [Temporal Predictors of Outcome in Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14773)
*Joey David*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs internally commit to eventual outcomes very early in reasoning chains, with correctness predictable after just a few tokens despite needing longer outputs for final answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how early LLMs internally commit to eventual outcomes during chain-of-thought reasoning, and investigate the relationship between reasoning length and question difficulty.

Method: Trained linear classifiers on hidden states after the first t reasoning tokens to predict eventual correctness, analyzed predictive accuracy across different question difficulties.

Result: Eventual correctness is highly predictable after only a few reasoning tokens, with harder questions showing accuracy drops due to selection artifacts where difficult items require longer CoTs.

Conclusion: Reasoning models develop internal self-assessment of success very early in the reasoning process, with implications for interpretability and inference-time control.

Abstract: The chain-of-thought (CoT) paradigm uses the elicitation of step-by-step rationales as a proxy for reasoning, gradually refining the model's latent representation of a solution. However, it remains unclear just how early a Large Language Model (LLM) internally commits to an eventual outcome. We probe this by training linear classifiers on hidden states after the first t reasoning tokens, showing that eventual correctness is highly predictable after only a few tokens, even when longer outputs are needed to reach a definite answer. We show that, for harder questions, a drop in predictive accuracy highlights a selection artifact: hard items are disproportionately represented in long CoTs. Overall, our results imply that for reasoning models, internal self-assessment of success tends to emerge after only a few tokens, with implications for interpretability and for inference-time control.

### [3] [LiveCLKTBench: Towards Reliable Evaluation of Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer in Multilingual LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14774)
*Pei-Fu Guo,Yun-Da Tsai,Chun-Chia Hsu,Kai-Xin Chen,Ya-An Tsai,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng,Mi-Yen Yeh,Shou-De Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiveCLKTBench is an automated pipeline for evaluating cross-lingual knowledge transfer in LLMs by generating time-sensitive factual questions and translating them across languages to isolate genuine transfer from pre-training exposure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods cannot distinguish between genuine cross-lingual knowledge transfer and prior exposure during pre-training, making it difficult to accurately assess LLMs' multilingual capabilities.

Method: Automated pipeline that identifies time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, verifies them against model knowledge, generates factual questions from valid entities, and translates them into multiple languages.

Result: Cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. Larger models improve transfer but gains diminish with scale and vary across domains.

Conclusion: LiveCLKTBench provides reliable evaluation of cross-lingual knowledge transfer and reveals important insights about linguistic distance, asymmetry, and scaling effects in multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Evaluating cross-lingual knowledge transfer in large language models is challenging, as correct answers in a target language may arise either from genuine transfer or from prior exposure during pre-training. We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains. These findings provide new insights into multilingual transfer and demonstrate the value of LiveCLKTBench as a reliable benchmark for future research.

### [4] [COMPASS: Context-Modulated PID Attention Steering System for Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14776)
*Snigdha Pandya,Rohan Nagale,Kenji Sahay,Anna Lin,Shikhar Shiromani,Kevin Zhu,Dev Sunishchal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPASS is a lightweight control framework that uses a PID controller to dynamically modulate attention heads during decoding, reducing factual hallucinations in LLMs by steering context reliance without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate fluent but factually incorrect statements despite having access to relevant evidence, due to improper attention allocation between contextual and parametric knowledge. Understanding and steering this internal behavior is crucial for trustworthy deployment and scientific interpretability.

Method: Introduces COMPASS with a Context Reliance Score (CRS) metric that quantifies context reliance and serves as an online probe. Uses a PID controller to dynamically modulate attention heads during decoding to maintain factual consistency without retraining or multi-pass decoding.

Result: Across multiple benchmarks (HotpotQA, XSum, HaluEval, RAGTruth), COMPASS consistently reduces contextual hallucination rates by 2.8 to 5.8 percent absolute while revealing how distinct attention heads contribute to evidence alignment.

Conclusion: Feedback-driven interpretability provides a pathway toward scientific understanding of LLM behavior, demonstrating that lightweight control frameworks can effectively reduce factual inconsistencies while maintaining model interpretability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but factually incorrect statements despite having access to relevant evidence, a failure mode rooted in how they allocate attention between contextual and parametric knowledge. Understanding and steering this internal behavior is key both for trustworthy deployment and for scientific interpretability of model mechanisms. We introduce COMPASS (Context-Modulated PID Attention Steering System), a lightweight, interpretable control framework that embeds a model-based feedback loop directly within decoding. COMPASS quantifies context reliance via a transparent metric, the Context Reliance Score (CRS), which serves as an online probe of how attention heads ground generation in evidence. Using this interpretable signal, a PID controller dynamically modulates attention heads to maintain factual consistency without retraining or multi-pass decoding. Across benchmarks (HotpotQA, XSum, HaluEval, RAGTruth), COMPASS consistently reduces contextual hallucination rates (2.8 to 5.8 percent absolute) while revealing how distinct attention heads contribute to evidence alignment. These results highlight feedback-driven interpretability as a pathway toward scientific understanding of LLM behavior.

### [5] [The Impact of Prosodic Segmentation on Speech Synthesis of Spontaneous Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14779)
*Julio Cesar Galdino,Sidney Evaldo Leal,Leticia Gabriella De Souza,Rodrigo de Freitas Lima,Antonio Nelson Fornari Mendes Moreira,Arnaldo Candido Junior,Miguel Oliveira,Edresson Casanova,Sandra M. Aluísio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluates effects of manual vs automatic prosodic segmentation on Brazilian Portuguese speech synthesis using FastSpeech 2, finding prosodic segmentation improves intelligibility and naturalness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spontaneous speech synthesis faces challenges in capturing conversational elements like turn-taking and disfluencies, with limited exploration of explicit prosodic segmentation's impact.

Method: Used FastSpeech 2 non-autoregressive model trained with manual and automatic prosodic segmentation annotations on Brazilian Portuguese data.

Result: Prosodic segmentation produced slightly more intelligible and natural speech; manual segmentation introduced greater variability for more natural prosody; both approaches reproduced nuclear accent patterns.

Conclusion: Explicit prosodic segmentation benefits spontaneous speech synthesis, with manual segmentation providing better prosodic variability; all resources made publicly available.

Abstract: Spontaneous speech presents several challenges for speech synthesis, particularly in capturing the natural flow of conversation, including turn-taking, pauses, and disfluencies. Although speech synthesis systems have made significant progress in generating natural and intelligible speech, primarily through architectures that implicitly model prosodic features such as pitch, intensity, and duration, the construction of datasets with explicit prosodic segmentation and their impact on spontaneous speech synthesis remains largely unexplored. This paper evaluates the effects of manual and automatic prosodic segmentation annotations in Brazilian Portuguese on the quality of speech synthesized by a non-autoregressive model, FastSpeech 2. Experimental results show that training with prosodic segmentation produced slightly more intelligible and acoustically natural speech. While automatic segmentation tends to create more regular segments, manual prosodic segmentation introduces greater variability, which contributes to more natural prosody. Analysis of neutral declarative utterances showed that both training approaches reproduced the expected nuclear accent pattern, but the prosodic model aligned more closely with natural pre-nuclear contours. To support reproducibility and future research, all datasets, source codes, and trained models are publicly available under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.

Motivation: Standardized Patients (SP) are expensive, inflexible, and difficult to scale for clinical skills training, while existing LLM-based SP simulators show inconsistent behavior and lack rigorous comparison with human SP.

Method: Multi-agent framework with Patient Agent for realistic dialogue, Auxiliary Agent for factual consistency, and Evaluation Agent for actionable feedback, plus SPBench benchmark with real SP-doctor interactions across 14 specialties.

Result: EasyMED matches human SP learning outcomes while producing greater skill gains for lower-baseline students and offering improved flexibility, psychological safety, and cost efficiency.

Conclusion: EasyMED provides a scalable, cost-effective alternative to human SPs that maintains educational effectiveness while addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Standardized Patients (SP) are indispensable for clinical skills training but remain expensive, inflexible, and difficult to scale. Existing large-language-model (LLM)-based SP simulators promise lower cost yet show inconsistent behavior and lack rigorous comparison with human SP. We present EasyMED, a multi-agent framework combining a Patient Agent for realistic dialogue, an Auxiliary Agent for factual consistency, and an Evaluation Agent that delivers actionable feedback. To support systematic assessment, we introduce SPBench, a benchmark of real SP-doctor interactions spanning 14 specialties and eight expert-defined evaluation criteria. Experiments demonstrate that EasyMED matches human SP learning outcomes while producing greater skill gains for lower-baseline students and offering improved flexibility, psychological safety, and cost efficiency.

*Adel Hidri,Suleiman Ali Alsaif,Muteeb Alahmari,Eman AlShehri,Minyar Sassi Hidri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a hybrid BGRU-LSTM model for sentiment analysis that outperforms traditional deep learning methods with 95% accuracy and improved recall for negative sentiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sentiment analysis methods (lexicon-based and traditional ML) are insufficient for handling contextual nuances and scalability. Deep learning shows promise but needs improvement in capturing semantic relationships and addressing class imbalance.

Method: Hybrid deep neural network combining bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis of text opinions from social media and e-commerce.

Result: Achieved 95% testing accuracy on IMDB and Amazon datasets, outperforming LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%). Improved negative sentiment recall from 86% to 96% and reduced misclassification loss from 20.24% to 13.3%.

Conclusion: The hybrid BGRU-LSTM model effectively enhances sentiment analysis by better handling contextual nuances, scalability, and class imbalance, providing more equitable and accurate sentiment classification.

Abstract: Understanding customer attitudes has become a critical component of decision-making due to the growing influence of social media and e-commerce. Text-based opinions are the most structured, hence playing an important role in sentiment analysis. Most of the existing methods, which include lexicon-based approaches and traditional machine learning techniques, are insufficient for handling contextual nuances and scalability. While the latter has limitations in model performance and generalization, deep learning (DL) has achieved improvement, especially on semantic relationship capturing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of the study is to enhance opinion mining by introducing a hybrid deep neural network model that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis, particularly addressing challenges such as contextual nuance, scalability, and class imbalance. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing benchmark datasets, encompassing IMDB movie critiques and Amazon product evaluations. The introduced hybrid BGRULSTM (HBGRU-LSTM) architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95%, exceeding the performance of traditional DL frameworks such as LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%). Moreover, our model exhibited a noteworthy enhancement in recall for negative sentiments, escalating from 86% (unbalanced dataset) to 96% (balanced dataset), thereby ensuring a more equitable and just sentiment classification. Furthermore, the model diminished misclassification loss from 20.24% for unbalanced to 13.3% for balanced dataset, signifying enhanced generalization and resilience.

### [8] [Hierarchical Token Prepending: Enhancing Information Flow in Decoder-based LLM Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14868)
*Xueying Ding,Xingyue Huang,Mingxuan Ju,Liam Collins,Yozen Liu,Leman Akoglu,Neil Shah,Tong Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HTP improves long-document embeddings by using hierarchical token prepending and mean-pooling to address information flow limitations in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM embeddings suffer from restricted backward information flow due to causal attention, and single summary token methods over-compress information in long documents.

Method: Partition input into blocks and prepend block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks for multiple backward information pathways, plus replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling.

Result: Consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings.

Conclusion: HTP provides a scalable, architecture-agnostic method to enhance both zero-shot and finetuned models for superior long-document embeddings.

Abstract: Large language models produce powerful text embeddings, but their causal attention mechanism restricts the flow of information from later to earlier tokens, degrading representation quality. While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis. HTP achieves consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings. As a simple, architecture-agnostic method, HTP enhances both zero-shot and finetuned models, offering a scalable route to superior long-document embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are powerful but susceptible to hallucinations - plausible-sounding but factually incorrect outputs that undermine reliability.

Method: Combines probabilistic modeling, information theory, trigonometric signal analysis, and Bayesian uncertainty estimation to analyze error compounding, propose refined uncertainty metrics, and develop mitigation strategies including contrastive decoding, retrieval-augmented grounding, factual alignment, and abstention.

Conclusion: The framework provides principled approaches to support safer and more reliable LLMs by mathematically grounding the understanding and mitigation of hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful linguistic engines but remain susceptible to hallucinations: plausible-sounding outputs that are factually incorrect or unsupported. In this work, we present a mathematically grounded framework to understand, measure, and mitigate these hallucinations. Drawing on probabilistic modeling, information theory, trigonometric signal analysis, and Bayesian uncertainty estimation, we analyze how errors compound autoregressively, propose refined uncertainty metrics, including semantic and phase-aware variants, and develop principled mitigation strategies such as contrastive decoding, retrieval-augmented grounding, factual alignment, and abstention. This unified lens connects recent advances in calibration, retrieval, and alignment to support safer and more reliable LLMs.

*Yang Wu,Rujing Yao,Tong Zhang,Yufei Shi,Zhuoren Jiang,Zhushan Li,Xiaozhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TASA is a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning, achieving superior outcomes compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based tutoring systems fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns, particularly in mathematics where fine-grained scaffolding is crucial.

Method: TASA maintains structured student persona with proficiency profiles and event memory, incorporates continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing to dynamically update mastery state, and generates difficulty-calibrated questions/explanations.

Result: Empirical results show TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines.

Conclusion: Modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles is essential for effective LLM-based tutoring systems, as demonstrated by TASA's success in personalized mathematics instruction.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into intelligent tutoring systems to provide human-like and adaptive instruction. However, most existing approaches fail to capture how students' knowledge evolves dynamically across their proficiencies, conceptual gaps, and forgetting patterns. This challenge is particularly acute in mathematics tutoring, where effective instruction requires fine-grained scaffolding precisely calibrated to each student's mastery level and cognitive retention. To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models in Indian languages, addressing limitations in current multilingual VLM evaluations through semi-automated dataset creation and comprehensive benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in multilingual VLM evaluations including reliance on auto-translations, narrow task coverage, limited samples, and lack of culturally relevant content for low-resource languages like Hindi and Telugu.

Method: Semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; creation of HinTel-AlignBench with adapted English datasets and native Indic datasets covering STEM and cultural content.

Result: Found performance regression in Indian languages vs English for 4 out of 5 tasks across models, with average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points in Telugu; identified common failure modes in multilingual multimodal understanding.

Conclusion: The framework enables robust evaluation of VLMs in Indian languages, revealing significant performance gaps and highlighting areas for improvement in multilingual multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: With nearly 1.5 billion people and more than 120 major languages, India represents one of the most diverse regions in the world. As multilingual Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, robust evaluation methodologies are essential to drive progress toward equitable AI for low-resource languages. Current multilingual VLM evaluations suffer from four major limitations: reliance on unverified auto-translations, narrow task/domain coverage, limited sample sizes, and lack of cultural and natively sourced Question-Answering (QA). To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English. Using the framework, we generate HinTel-AlignBench, a benchmark that draws from diverse sources in Hindi and Telugu with English-aligned samples. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a semi-automated dataset creation framework combining back-translation, filtering, and human verification; (2) the most comprehensive vision-language benchmark for Hindi and and Telugu, including adapted English datasets (VQAv2, RealWorldQA, CLEVR-Math) and native novel Indic datasets (JEE for STEM, VAANI for cultural grounding) with approximately 4,000 QA pairs per language; and (3) a detailed performance analysis of various State-of-the-Art (SOTA) open-weight and closed-source VLMs. We find a regression in performance for tasks in English versus in Indian languages for 4 out of 5 tasks across all the models, with an average regression of 8.3 points in Hindi and 5.5 points for Telugu. We categorize common failure modes to highlight concrete areas of improvement in multilingual multimodal understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Intrinsic dimension (ID) in LLMs is determined by text genre: scientific text has low ID, encyclopedic medium, and creative/opinion writing high ID. ID captures geometric complexity orthogonal to entropy-based metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the textual determinants of intrinsic dimension in LLMs, which remains underexplored despite its importance in analyzing training dynamics, scaling behavior, and dataset structure.

Method: Cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify causal features affecting ID, plus steering experiments to confirm causality.

Result: Scientific prose has low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5). Scientific signals reduce ID while humanized signals increase it.

Conclusion: Scientific writing appears "easy" for contemporary models, while fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. The study provides practical guidance for proper use and interpretation of ID-based results.

Abstract: Intrinsic dimension (ID) is an important tool in modern LLM analysis, informing studies of training dynamics, scaling behavior, and dataset structure, yet its textual determinants remain underexplored. We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text "representationally simple" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively "easy", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised clinical NER models require costly annotated data, while existing zero-shot approaches struggle with example selection granularity and integrating prompts with self-improvement.

Method: OEMA uses three components: a self-annotator generating examples, a discriminator filtering them via SNOMED CT ontology, and a predictor using entity descriptions for accurate inference through multi-agent collaboration.

Result: On MTSamples and VAERS datasets, OEMA achieves state-of-the-art exact-match performance, matches supervised BioClinicalBERT under related-match, and surpasses CRF.

Conclusion: OEMA addresses key zero-shot NER challenges through ontology-guided reasoning and multi-agent collaboration, achieving near-supervised performance and showing promise for clinical NLP applications.

Abstract: Clinical named entity recognition (NER) is crucial for extracting information from electronic health records (EHRs), but supervised models like CRF and BioClinicalBERT require costly annotated data. While zero-shot NER with large language models (LLMs) reduces this dependency, it struggles with example selection granularity and integrating prompts with self-improvement. To address this, we propose OEMA, a zero-shot clinical NER framework using multi-agent collaboration. OEMA's three components are: a self-annotator generating examples, a discriminator filtering them via SNOMED CT, and a predictor using entity descriptions for accurate inference. On MTSamples and VAERS datasets, OEMA achieves state-of-the-art exact-match performance. Under related-match, it matches supervised BioClinicalBERT and surpasses CRF.

### [14] [Context Cascade Compression: Exploring the Upper Limits of Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15244)
*Fanfan Liu,Haibo Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C3 (Context Cascade Compression) uses two LLMs in cascade to compress long contexts into latent tokens, achieving 98% accuracy at 20x compression and 93% at 40x compression, outperforming DeepSeek-OCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational and memory challenges from million-level token inputs in long-context tasks by exploring upper limits of text compression.

Method: Cascades two LLMs: small LLM compresses long context into latent tokens (32-64 length), large LLM decodes from compressed context using pure-text pipeline.

Result: 98% decoding accuracy at 20x compression ratio vs ~60% for DeepSeek-OCR; maintains ~93% accuracy at 40x compression ratio.

Conclusion: C3 demonstrates superior performance over optical character compression, suggests potential upper bound for compression ratios, and uses simpler pure-text approach.

Abstract: Million-level token inputs in long-context tasks pose significant computational and memory challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs). Recently, DeepSeek-OCR conducted research into the feasibility of Contexts Optical Compression and achieved preliminary results. Inspired by this, we introduce Context Cascade Compression C3 to explore the upper limits of text compression. Our method cascades two LLMs of different sizes to handle the compression and decoding tasks. Specifically, a small LLM, acting as the first stage, performs text compression by condensing a long context into a set of latent tokens (e.g., 32 or 64 in length), achieving a high ratio of text tokens to latent tokens. A large LLM, as the second stage, then executes the decoding task on this compressed context. Experiments show that at a 20x compression ratio (where the number of text tokens is 20 times the number of latent tokens), our model achieves 98% decoding accuracy, compared to approximately 60% for DeepSeek-OCR. When we further increase the compression ratio to 40x, the accuracy is maintained at around 93%. This indicates that in the domain of context compression, C3 Compression demonstrates superior performance and feasibility over optical character compression. C3 uses a simpler, pure-text pipeline that ignores factors like layout, color, and information loss from a visual encoder. This also suggests a potential upper bound for compression ratios in future work on optical character compression, OCR, and related fields.

In this paper, we extend the experiments to the other three languages of the shared task - Tamil, Malayalam and Bangla, and take a closer look at the data quality and evaluation metric used. Our results primarily highlight the potential of small language models, and summarize the concerns related to creating good quality datasets and appropriate metrics for this task that are suitable for Indian language scripts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Adversarial poetry serves as a universal jailbreak technique for LLMs, achieving high attack success rates across 25 models by converting harmful prompts into poetic form, revealing systematic vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether stylistic variations like poetry can circumvent LLM safety mechanisms, testing the robustness of current alignment methods across different model families and safety training approaches.

Method: Curated poetic prompts and meta-prompt conversions of 1,200 harmful prompts into verse, evaluated across 25 proprietary and open-weight models using ensemble judge models and human-validated subsets with double-annotations.

Result: Poetic attacks achieved 62% success for hand-crafted poems and 43% for meta-prompt conversions, substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines (up to 18x higher ASR), with some providers exceeding 90% attack success rates.

Conclusion: Stylistic variation alone can bypass contemporary safety mechanisms, indicating fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols across diverse risk domains.

Abstract: We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for large language models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.

Motivation: Aircraft Maintenance Technicians spend up to 30% of work time searching manuals, creating efficiency bottlenecks in MRO operations where every procedure must be traceable to certified sources.

Method: System adapts LLM reranking and semantic search to work alongside certified legacy viewers, constructs revision-robust embeddings from ATA chapter hierarchies, and uses vision-language parsing to structure certified content.

Result: Evaluation on 49k synthetic queries achieved >90% retrieval accuracy. Bilingual studies with 10 licensed AMTs showed 90.9% top-10 success rate and 95% reduction in lookup time (from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds per task).

Abstract: Aircraft Maintenance Technicians (AMTs) spend up to 30% of work time searching manuals, a documented efficiency bottleneck in MRO operations where every procedure must be traceable to certified sources. We present a compliance-preserving retrieval system that adapts LLM reranking and semantic search to aviation MRO environments by operating alongside, rather than replacing, certified legacy viewers. The system constructs revision-robust embeddings from ATA chapter hierarchies and uses vision-language parsing to structure certified content, allowing technicians to preview ranked tasks and access verified procedures in existing viewers. Evaluation on 49k synthetic queries achieves >90% retrieval accuracy, while bilingual controlled studies with 10 licensed AMTs demonstrate 90.9% top-10 success rate and 95% reduction in lookup time, from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds per task. These gains provide concrete evidence that semantic retrieval can operate within strict regulatory constraints and meaningfully reduce operational workload in real-world multilingual MRO workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEPO is a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that improves LLM agent efficiency by reducing both token usage per step and total steps needed, achieving significant efficiency gains while maintaining or improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agents with rich reasoning capabilities suffer from long chain-of-thought processes, hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios, but there lacks systematic definition and targeted improvements for LLM agent efficiency.

Method: Proposed dual-efficiency definition with step-level (minimize tokens per step) and trajectory-level (minimize steps to complete task) efficiency, then developed DEPO method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps through preference optimization.

Result: DEPO reduces token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9% on WebShop and BabyAI, while achieving up to 29.3% performance improvement. It also generalizes to math benchmarks and maintains efficiency with only 25% training data.

Conclusion: DEPO successfully addresses LLM agent efficiency through dual-efficiency optimization, demonstrating substantial efficiency improvements without sacrificing performance, with strong generalization capabilities and data efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their reasoning and decision-making abilities when deployed as agents. Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/DEPO.

*Shanlin Zhou,Xinpeng Wang,Jianxun Lian,Zhenghao Liu,Laks V. S. Lakshmanan,Xiaoyuan Yi,Yongtao Hao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NAMEGEn is a multi-agent framework for Chinese baby naming that addresses multi-objective flexibility and interpretive complexity in creative text generation through iterative optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs struggle with personalized, fine-grained requirements and implicit meaning interpretation in creative text generation, especially for short-form content like baby naming.

Method: Proposed NAMEGEn framework with multi-agent optimization that alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation, enhanced by a classical Chinese poetry corpus.

Result: Outperforms six baseline methods across various LLM backbones without training, effectively generating creative names meeting diverse requirements with meaningful explanations.

Conclusion: NAMEGEn successfully addresses CNLG challenges in short-form generation through multi-agent optimization and aesthetic enhancement from classical poetry.

Abstract: Trained on diverse human-authored texts, Large Language Models (LLMs) unlocked the potential for Creative Natural Language Generation (CNLG), benefiting various applications like advertising and storytelling. Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.

Conclusion: The proposed Multi-Decoder architecture with phonemic CLS effectively improves multilingual ASR performance and language/dialect identification in data-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: This paper describes the systems developed by SPRING Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, for the ASRU MADASR 2.0 challenge. The systems developed focuses on adapting ASR systems to improve in predicting the language and dialect of the utterance among 8 languages across 33 dialects. We participated in Track 1 and Track 2, which restricts the use of additional data and develop from-the-scratch multilingual systems. We presented a novel training approach using Multi-Decoder architecture with phonemic Common Label Set (CLS) as intermediate representation. It improved the performance over the baseline (in the CLS space). We also discuss various methods used to retain the gain obtained in the phonemic space while converting them back to the corresponding grapheme representations. Our systems beat the baseline in 3 languages (Track 2) in terms of WER/CER and achieved the highest language ID and dialect ID accuracy among all participating teams (Track 2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based clustering methods are limited by lack of stateful memory for iterative refinement and difficulty managing cluster granularity, forcing reliance on complex external modules rather than true end-to-end approaches.

Method: Uses Dynamic Memory to provide state awareness and Dual-Prompt Strategy to enable the model to reason about and determine the optimal number of clusters, creating a fully LLM-native clustering framework.

Result: Significantly and consistently outperforms strong baselines on several benchmark datasets without requiring any tuning.

Conclusion: LLM-MemCluster presents an effective, interpretable, and truly end-to-end paradigm for LLM-based text clustering that overcomes fundamental limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping unsupervised learning by offering an unprecedented ability to perform text clustering based on their deep semantic understanding. However, their direct application is fundamentally limited by a lack of stateful memory for iterative refinement and the difficulty of managing cluster granularity. As a result, existing methods often rely on complex pipelines with external modules, sacrificing a truly end-to-end approach. We introduce LLM-MemCluster, a novel framework that reconceptualizes clustering as a fully LLM-native task. It leverages a Dynamic Memory to instill state awareness and a Dual-Prompt Strategy to enable the model to reason about and determine the number of clusters. Evaluated on several benchmark datasets, our tuning-free framework significantly and consistently outperforms strong baselines. LLM-MemCluster presents an effective, interpretable, and truly end-to-end paradigm for LLM-based text clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in AI-based language processing including lack of standardization in data organization/sharing and absence of reproducible methodologies.

Method: 1) LPDS: BIDS-inspired folder/file naming structure for linguistic data; 2) pelican nlp: modular Python package for streamlined processing from cleaning to feature extraction using shareable configuration files.

Result: Provides end-to-end processing pipeline that outputs preprocessed data or standardized linguistic/acoustic features with result aggregations.

Conclusion: LPDS and pelican nlp collectively ensure methodological transparency and enhance reproducibility in linguistic research.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models and other influential developments in AI-based language processing have led to an evolution in the methods available to quantitatively analyse language data. With the resultant growth of attention on language processing, significant challenges have emerged, including the lack of standardisation in organising and sharing linguistic data and the absence of standardised and reproducible processing methodologies. Striving for future standardisation, we first propose the Language Processing Data Structure (LPDS), a data structure inspired by the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a widely adopted standard for handling neuroscience data. It provides a folder structure and file naming conventions for linguistic research. Second, we introduce pelican nlp, a modular and extensible Python package designed to enable streamlined language processing, from initial data cleaning and task-specific preprocessing to the extraction of sophisticated linguistic and acoustic features, such as semantic embeddings and prosodic metrics. The entire processing workflow can be specified within a single, shareable configuration file, which pelican nlp then executes on LPDS-formatted data. Depending on the specifications, the reproducible output can consist of preprocessed language data or standardised extraction of both linguistic and acoustic features and corresponding result aggregations. LPDS and pelican nlp collectively offer an end-to-end processing pipeline for linguistic data, designed to ensure methodological transparency and enhance reproducibility.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of multimodal benchmarks for Russian language MLLMs and better understand their intelligence, limitations, and risks.

Method: Created 18 datasets from scratch with Russian cultural specificity, unified prompts and metrics, plus methodology for preventing benchmark leakage through watermarking and licenses.

Result: Established baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models using the new evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly Slavic languages.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are currently at the center of research attention, showing rapid progress in scale and capabilities, yet their intelligence, limitations, and risks remain insufficiently understood. To address these issues, particularly in the context of the Russian language, where no multimodal benchmarks currently exist, we introduce Mera Multi, an open multimodal evaluation framework for Russian-spoken architectures. The benchmark is instruction-based and encompasses default text, image, audio, and video modalities, comprising 18 newly constructed evaluation tasks for both general-purpose models and modality-specific architectures (image-to-text, video-to-text, and audio-to-text). Our contributions include: (i) a universal taxonomy of multimodal abilities; (ii) 18 datasets created entirely from scratch with attention to Russian cultural and linguistic specificity, unified prompts, and metrics; (iii) baseline results for both closed-source and open-source models; (iv) a methodology for preventing benchmark leakage, including watermarking and licenses for private sets. While our current focus is on Russian, the proposed benchmark provides a replicable methodology for constructing multimodal benchmarks in typologically diverse languages, particularly within the Slavic language family.

Motivation: To address the lack of systematic benchmarks for phase-wise modeling and assessment in Chinese second language acquisition, which is ethically and practically challenging to study with human learners.

Method: Created HSKBenchmark with 6.76M token textbooks, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. Also built HSKAgent fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs achieved writing performance comparable to advanced human learners and exhibited human-like acquisition characteristics. The benchmark effectively models Chinese SLA and serves as a reliable tool for dynamic writing assessment.

Conclusion: HSKBenchmark provides foundational tools and resources that can advance research on language acquisition modeling and LLM interpretability, with publicly available code and data.

Abstract: Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

*Violeta Kastreva,Philip Whittington,Dennis Komm,Tiago Pimentel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tokenisation is NP-complete even for binary and unary alphabets, proving computational intractability is fundamental and not due to large alphabets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous work showed tokenisation is NP-complete but assumed unbounded alphabets, which is unrealistic since practical tokenisers use fixed-size alphabets like bytes or Unicode characters.

Method: Analyzed tokenisation over bounded n-ary alphabets, considering bottom-up tokenisation (merge operations) and direct tokenisation (vocabulary selection), proving hardness for binary and unary alphabets.

Result: Both variants are NP-complete even with binary alphabets and admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme unless P=NP. Direct tokenisation remains NP-complete for unary alphabets.

Conclusion: Computational intractability of tokenisation is fundamental, explaining why practical algorithms like BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points to approximation algorithms as important future direction.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that tokenisation is NP-complete. However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: bottom-up tokenisation and direct tokenisation, where we must, respectively, select a sequence of merge operations or a vocabulary whose application optimally compresses a dataset. First, we note that proving hardness results for an $n$-ary alphabet proves the same results for alphabets of any larger size. We then prove that even with binary alphabets, both variants are not only NP-complete, but admit no polynomial-time approximation scheme (unless P=NP). We further show that direct tokenisation remains NP-complete even when applied to unary alphabets. While unary alphabets may not be practically useful, this result establishes that the computational intractability of tokenisation is not an artifact of large alphabets or complex constructions, but a fundamental barrier. Overall, our results explain why practical algorithms such as BPE and UnigramLM are heuristic, and points toward approximation algorithms being an important path going forward for tokenisation research.

TL;DR: CNN-based DoubleU-Net outperformed transformer and Mamba architectures for dental caries segmentation, achieving best results despite simpler architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated dental caries segmentation is challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data in panoramic radiographs.

Method: Comprehensive benchmarking of 12 architectures (CNNs, vision transformers, state-space mamba) on DC1000 dataset under identical configurations.

Result: DoubleU-Net achieved highest dice coefficient (0.7345), mIoU (0.5978), and precision (0.8145), with CNN-based methods dominating top 3 positions across all metrics.

Conclusion: Architecture-task alignment is more important than model complexity in medical image segmentation; transformers and Mamba underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors.

Abstract: Accurate identification and segmentation of dental caries in panoramic radiographs are critical for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity.

*Fuyang Zhang,Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman,Xiang Xu,Yasutaka Furukawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BR-DF is a novel geometric representation for CAD B-Rep models using volumetric distance functions, enabling 100% successful conversion to watertight B-Rep models via an extended Marching Cubes algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust CAD representation that guarantees successful conversion to watertight B-Rep models, overcoming failure issues in existing methods.

Method: Encodes CAD geometry as signed distance functions (SDF) and topology as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDF), then uses an extended Marching Cubes algorithm for conversion. A multi-branch latent diffusion model with 3D U-Net generates SDF and UDFs.

Result: Achieves comparable CAD generation performance to state-of-the-art methods while reaching unprecedented 100% success rate in producing faceted B-Rep models.

Conclusion: BR-DF provides a reliable geometric representation for CAD B-Rep that ensures guaranteed successful model generation, making it superior to existing approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel geometric representation for CAD Boundary Representation (B-Rep) based on volumetric distance functions, dubbed B-Rep Distance Functions (BR-DF). BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model. Our approach achieves comparable CAD generation performance against SOTA methods while reaching the unprecedented 100% success rate in producing (faceted) B-Rep models.

*Antonio Ruiz,Tao Wu,Andrew Melnik,Qing Cheng,Xuqin Wang,Lu Liu,Yongliang Wang,Yanfeng Zhang,Helge Ritter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSceneGraph is a method that synthesizes 3D indoor scenes from text prompts by leveraging graph structure and geometric symmetries without predefined relationship classes, achieving comparable performance to methods that use ground-truth relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either train from scratch and overlook scene graph structure (limiting coherence), or require inconvenient user-provided semantic graphs or ground-truth relationship annotations (restricting object interaction variety). Resource-constrained devices need smaller task-specific models.

Method: Uses equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) with a novel text conditioning strategy to handle complex text modalities, leveraging scene graph structure and geometric symmetries without predefined relationship classes.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to methods that use ground-truth relationships, despite not using them. The text conditioning strategy for EGNNs is validated through ablation studies.

Conclusion: GeoSceneGraph provides an effective approach for 3D scene synthesis from text that captures varied object interactions without requiring predefined relationship classes, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Methods that synthesize indoor 3D scenes from text prompts have wide-ranging applications in film production, interior design, video games, virtual reality, and synthetic data generation for training embodied agents. Existing approaches typically either train generative models from scratch or leverage vision-language models (VLMs). While VLMs achieve strong performance, particularly for complex or open-ended prompts, smaller task-specific models remain necessary for deployment on resource-constrained devices such as extended reality (XR) glasses or mobile phones. However, many generative approaches that train from scratch overlook the inherent graph structure of indoor scenes, which can limit scene coherence and realism. Conversely, methods that incorporate scene graphs either demand a user-provided semantic graph, which is generally inconvenient and restrictive, or rely on ground-truth relationship annotations, limiting their capacity to capture more varied object interactions. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoSceneGraph, a method that synthesizes 3D scenes from text prompts by leveraging the graph structure and geometric symmetries of 3D scenes, without relying on predefined relationship classes. Despite not using ground-truth relationships, GeoSceneGraph achieves performance comparable to methods that do. Our model is built on equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), but existing EGNN approaches are typically limited to low-dimensional conditioning and are not designed to handle complex modalities such as text. We propose a simple and effective strategy for conditioning EGNNs on text features, and we validate our design through ablation studies.

TL;DR: Unsupervised bidirectional MRI synthesizer that converts between High-Field and Ultra-Low Field MRIs using physics-inspired forward modeling and Implicit Neural Representation for super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the contrast differences between HF and ULF MRIs by leveraging physical principles rather than relying on paired training data, enabling bidirectional synthesis without observed HF data.

Method: Forward model simulates HF to ULF transformation using tissue-type SNR estimation based on target contrast values. For super-resolution, uses Implicit Neural Representation network to predict tissue segmentations and image intensity simultaneously.

Result: WM-GM contrast improved by 52% in synthetic ULF-like images and 37% in 64mT images. Model demonstrated robustness to variations in target contrast, noise, and initial seeding.

Conclusion: The physics-inspired approach successfully enables unsupervised bidirectional MRI synthesis between HF and ULF fields, achieving significant contrast improvements and demonstrating robustness to parameter variations.

Abstract: We present an unsupervised single image bidirectional Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) synthesizer that synthesizes an Ultra-Low Field (ULF) like image from a High-Field (HF) magnitude image and vice-versa. Unlike existing MRI synthesis models, our approach is inspired by the physics that drives contrast changes between HF and ULF MRIs. Our forward model simulates a HF to ULF transformation by estimating the tissue-type Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) values based on target contrast values. For the Super-Resolution task, we used an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) network to synthesize HF image by simultaneously predicting tissue-type segmentations and image intensity without observed HF data. The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic ULF-like data from generated from standard 3T T$_1$-weighted images for qualitative assessments and paired 3T-64mT T$_1$-weighted images for validation experiments. WM-GM contrast improved by 52% in synthetic ULF-like images and 37% in 64mT images. Sensitivity experiments demonstrated the robustness of our forward model to variations in target contrast, noise and initial seeding.

*Daniel Gilo,Or Litany*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I-Mix2Mix is a framework that improves multi-view image editing by distilling 2D diffusion model editing capabilities into a pretrained multi-view diffusion model, achieving better cross-view consistency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for multi-view image editing from sparse input views struggle with artifacts and incoherent edits when modifying scenes according to textual instructions while maintaining consistency across all views.

Method: Proposes InstructMix2Mix (I-Mix2Mix) which replaces the neural field consolidator in Score Distillation Sampling with a multi-view diffusion student, featuring incremental student updates, specialized teacher noise scheduler, and attention modification for enhanced cross-view coherence.

Result: Experiments show I-Mix2Mix significantly improves multi-view consistency while maintaining high per-frame edit quality compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses multi-view editing challenges by leveraging data-driven 3D priors and novel distillation techniques to achieve coherent edits across sparse input views.

Abstract: We address the task of multi-view image editing from sparse input views, where the inputs can be seen as a mix of images capturing the scene from different viewpoints. The goal is to modify the scene according to a textual instruction while preserving consistency across all views. Existing methods, based on per-scene neural fields or temporal attention mechanisms, struggle in this setting, often producing artifacts and incoherent edits. We propose InstructMix2Mix (I-Mix2Mix), a framework that distills the editing capabilities of a 2D diffusion model into a pretrained multi-view diffusion model, leveraging its data-driven 3D prior for cross-view consistency. A key contribution is replacing the conventional neural field consolidator in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with a multi-view diffusion student, which requires novel adaptations: incremental student updates across timesteps, a specialized teacher noise scheduler to prevent degeneration, and an attention modification that enhances cross-view coherence without additional cost. Experiments demonstrate that I-Mix2Mix significantly improves multi-view consistency while maintaining high per-frame edit quality.

*Zehao Liu,Wejieying Ren,Jipeng Zhang,Tianxiang Zhao,Jingxi Zhu,Xiaoting Li,Vasant G. Honavar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkinR1 is a dermatological vision-language model that combines textbook-based reasoning with reinforcement learning to address data heterogeneity, lack of diagnostic rationales, and limited generalization in clinical AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show promise for dermatological diagnosis but face limitations in trustworthiness and clinical utility due to data heterogeneity, absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, and limited scalability/generalization.

Method: Proposes SkinR1 with three key components: (1) textbook-based reasoning generator for hierarchy-aware differential diagnosis trajectories, (2) supervised fine-tuning using these trajectories, and (3) novel RL paradigm incorporating disease hierarchy to transfer reasoning to sparse data.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate superior diagnostic accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the importance of the reasoning foundation from supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SkinR1 effectively addresses key challenges in clinical AI by combining deep textbook-based reasoning with reinforcement learning, achieving improved diagnostic performance and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones.
  To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT.

### [36] [FarSLIP: Discovering Effective CLIP Adaptation for Fine-Grained Remote Sensing Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14901)
*Zhenshi Li,Weikang Yu,Dilxat Muhtar,Xueliang Zhang,Pengfeng Xiao,Pedram Ghamisi,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FarSLIP is a fine-grained aligned remote sensing language-image pretraining framework that addresses CLIP's limited spatial awareness in RS domain through patch-to-patch distillation and CLS token-based region-category alignment, achieving SOTA on RS open-vocabulary segmentation and image-level tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RS-specific CLIP variants inherit limited spatial awareness due to: (1) underutilized object-level supervision in RS datasets with global captions, and (2) performance degradation when applying general domain region-text alignment methods to RS data.

Method: Constructed MGRS-200k dataset with multi-granularity RS image-text data and object-level supervision. Proposed FarSLIP framework using patch-to-patch distillation (instead of patch-to-CLS) to align local and global visual cues, and CLS token-based region-category alignment for spatial awareness.

Result: FarSLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, zero-shot classification, and image-text retrieval, demonstrating improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain.

Conclusion: FarSLIP effectively addresses CLIP's spatial limitations in RS domain through novel patch-to-patch distillation and simple CLS token alignment, setting new benchmarks while preserving semantic coherence.

Abstract: As CLIP's global alignment limits its ability to capture fine-grained details, recent efforts have focused on enhancing its region-text alignment. However, current remote sensing (RS)-specific CLIP variants still inherit this limited spatial awareness. We identify two key limitations behind this: (1) current RS image-text datasets generate global captions from object-level labels, leaving the original object-level supervision underutilized; (2) despite the success of region-text alignment methods in general domain, their direct application to RS data often leads to performance degradation. To address these, we construct the first multi-granularity RS image-text dataset, MGRS-200k, featuring rich object-level textual supervision for RS region-category alignment. We further investigate existing fine-grained CLIP tuning strategies and find that current explicit region-text alignment methods, whether in a direct or indirect way, underperform due to severe degradation of CLIP's semantic coherence. Building on these, we propose FarSLIP, a Fine-grained Aligned RS Language-Image Pretraining framework. Rather than the commonly used patch-to-CLS self-distillation, FarSLIP employs patch-to-patch distillation to align local and global visual cues, which improves feature discriminability while preserving semantic coherence. Additionally, to effectively utilize region-text supervision, it employs simple CLS token-based region-category alignment rather than explicit patch-level alignment, further enhancing spatial awareness. FarSLIP features improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain and sets a new state of the art not only on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, but also on image-level tasks such as zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval. Our dataset, code, and models are available at https://github.com/NJU-LHRS/FarSLIP.

Abstract: Computational pathology holds substantial promise for improving diagnosis and guiding treatment decisions. Recent pathology foundation models enable the extraction of rich patch-level representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs), but current approaches for aggregating these features into slide-level predictions remain constrained by design limitations that hinder generalizability and reliability. Here, we developed nnMIL, a simple yet broadly applicable multiple-instance learning framework that connects patch-level foundation models to robust slide-level clinical inference. nnMIL introduces random sampling at both the patch and feature levels, enabling large-batch optimization, task-aware sampling strategies, and efficient and scalable training across datasets and model architectures. A lightweight aggregator performs sliding-window inference to generate ensemble slide-level predictions and supports principled uncertainty estimation. Across 40,000 WSIs encompassing 35 clinical tasks and four pathology foundation models, nnMIL consistently outperformed existing MIL methods for disease diagnosis, histologic subtyping, molecular biomarker detection, and pan- cancer prognosis prediction. It further demonstrated strong cross-model generalization, reliable uncertainty quantification, and robust survival stratification in multiple external cohorts. In conclusion, nnMIL offers a practical and generalizable solution for translating pathology foundation models into clinically meaningful predictions, advancing the development and deployment of reliable AI systems in real-world settings.

TL;DR: X-WIN is a CXR world model that learns 3D anatomical knowledge from CT scans to improve 2D chest X-ray representation learning and disease diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chest X-rays are limited by structural superposition as 2D projectional images, making representation learning and disease diagnosis challenging due to lack of 3D anatomical information.

Method: Propose X-WIN model that distills volumetric knowledge from chest CT by predicting 2D projections in latent space, using affinity-guided contrastive alignment loss and incorporating real CXRs through masked image modeling with domain classifier.

Result: X-WIN outperforms existing foundation models on diverse downstream tasks using linear probing and few-shot fine-tuning, and can render 2D projections for 3D CT volume reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed X-WIN model successfully bridges the gap between 2D CXR and 3D CT knowledge, enabling improved representation learning and demonstrating the value of world models in medical imaging.

Abstract: Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) is an essential medical imaging technique for disease diagnosis. However, as 2D projectional images, CXRs are limited by structural superposition and hence fail to capture 3D anatomies. This limitation makes representation learning and disease diagnosis challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel CXR world model named X-WIN, which distills volumetric knowledge from chest computed tomography (CT) by learning to predict its 2D projections in latent space. The core idea is that a world model with internalized knowledge of 3D anatomical structure can predict CXRs under various transformations in 3D space. During projection prediction, we introduce an affinity-guided contrastive alignment loss that leverages mutual similarities to capture rich, correlated information across projections from the same volume. To improve model adaptability, we incorporate real CXRs into training through masked image modeling and employ a domain classifier to encourage statistically similar representations for real and simulated CXRs. Comprehensive experiments show that X-WIN outperforms existing foundation models on diverse downstream tasks using linear probing and few-shot fine-tuning. X-WIN also demonstrates the ability to render 2D projections for reconstructing a 3D CT volume.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPSL is a compact 2.5D video representation that enables volumetric-like experiences from 2D content using depth-guided scene layers with soft alpha bands and edge-depth cache for efficient novel-view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing volumetric video representations (point clouds, neural fields) are too costly in capture, computation, and rendering, limiting scalability for on-demand video and real-time communication.

Method: Decomposes frames into geometry-consistent layers using depth and content saliency, with soft alpha bands and edge-depth cache for occlusion preservation. Uses depth-weighted warping and front-to-back alpha compositing for novel-view synthesis without 3D reconstruction.

Result: Achieves superior perceptual quality and boundary fidelity compared to layer-based and neural-field baselines while reducing storage and rendering cost by several folds.

Conclusion: CPSL provides a practical path from 2D video to scalable 2.5D immersive media, bridging the gap between conventional 2D content and volumetric video benefits.

Abstract: Volumetric video enables immersive and interactive visual experiences by supporting free viewpoint exploration and realistic motion parallax. However, existing volumetric representations from explicit point clouds to implicit neural fields, remain costly in capture, computation, and rendering, which limits their scalability for on-demand video and reduces their feasibility for real-time communication.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Content-Promoted Scene Layers (CPSL), a compact 2.5D video representation that brings the perceptual benefits of volumetric video to conventional 2D content. Guided by per-frame depth and content saliency, CPSL decomposes each frame into a small set of geometry-consistent layers equipped with soft alpha bands and an edge-depth cache that jointly preserve occlusion ordering and boundary continuity. These lightweight, 2D-encodable assets enable parallax-corrected novel-view synthesis via depth-weighted warping and front-to-back alpha compositing, bypassing expensive 3D reconstruction. Temporally, CPSL maintains inter-frame coherence using motion-guided propagation and per-layer encoding, supporting real-time playback with standard video codecs. Across multiple benchmarks, CPSL achieves superior perceptual quality and boundary fidelity compared with layer-based and neural-field baselines while reducing storage and rendering cost by several folds. Our approach offer a practical path from 2D video to scalable 2.5D immersive media.

Motivation: Long-term periodic workflows with low-contrast patterns are underexplored compared to short-term periodic activities, creating a gap in understanding complex human activities in manufacturing, sports, and daily life.

Method: Created a benchmark with 580 multimodal human activity sequences and proposed a lightweight, training-free baseline method for modeling diverse periodic workflow patterns.

Result: The benchmark presents significant challenges to existing methods, while the proposed baseline outperforms competing methods by a substantial margin in all evaluation tasks and shows deployment advantages comparable to supervised approaches.

Conclusion: The work successfully addresses the gap in long-term periodic workflow analysis and provides a practical solution that eliminates the need for annotation and retraining in real-world applications.

Abstract: Periodic human activities with implicit workflows are common in manufacturing, sports, and daily life. While short-term periodic activities -- characterized by simple structures and high-contrast patterns -- have been widely studied, long-term periodic workflows with low-contrast patterns remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first benchmark comprising 580 multimodal human activity sequences featuring long-term periodic workflows. The benchmark supports three evaluation tasks aligned with real-world applications: unsupervised periodic workflow detection, task completion tracking, and procedural anomaly detection. We also propose a lightweight, training-free baseline for modeling diverse periodic workflow patterns. Experiments show that: (i) our benchmark presents significant challenges to both unsupervised periodic detection methods and zero-shot approaches based on powerful large language models (LLMs); (ii) our baseline outperforms competing methods by a substantial margin in all evaluation tasks; and (iii) in real-world applications, our baseline demonstrates deployment advantages on par with traditional supervised workflow detection approaches, eliminating the need for annotation and retraining.

TL;DR: A low-cost LED Clock method for millisecond-level synchronization of heterogeneous multi-view camera systems using visual time encoding with red and infrared LEDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronizing multiple cameras in heterogeneous setups (professional/consumer, RGB/IR, with/without audio) is challenging without hardware synchronization, especially in real-world environments.

Method: Uses a custom LED Clock that encodes time through red and infrared LEDs, allowing visual decoding of exposure windows from recorded frames for synchronization.

Result: Achieves 1.34ms RMSE residual error, outperforms light-, audio-, and timecode-based approaches, and improves downstream tasks like multi-view pose estimation and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The solution simplifies synchronization pipelines and enables advanced vision-based sensing in unconstrained industrial and clinical environments.

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal alignment of multi-view video streams is essential for a wide range of dynamic-scene applications such as multi-view 3D reconstruction, pose estimation, and scene understanding. However, synchronizing multiple cameras remains a significant challenge, especially in heterogeneous setups combining professional and consumer-grade devices, visible and infrared sensors, or systems with and without audio, where common hardware synchronization capabilities are often unavailable. This limitation is particularly evident in real-world environments, where controlled capture conditions are not feasible. In this work, we present a low-cost, general-purpose synchronization method that achieves millisecond-level temporal alignment across diverse camera systems while supporting both visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) modalities. The proposed solution employs a custom-built \textit{LED Clock} that encodes time through red and infrared LEDs, allowing visual decoding of the exposure window (start and end times) from recorded frames for millisecond-level synchronization. We benchmark our method against hardware synchronization and achieve a residual error of 1.34~ms RMSE across multiple recordings. In further experiments, our method outperforms light-, audio-, and timecode-based synchronization approaches and directly improves downstream computer vision tasks, including multi-view pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. Finally, we validate the system in large-scale surgical recordings involving over 25 heterogeneous cameras spanning both IR and RGB modalities. This solution simplifies and streamlines the synchronization pipeline and expands access to advanced vision-based sensing in unconstrained environments, including industrial and clinical applications.

Result: Experimentally proven 20% to 50% reduction in smoke suction pump's energy consumption through automatic pump halting during inactive times and dynamic power adjustment.

Conclusion: The integrated DL approach substantially contributes to sustainable development in manufacturing by enabling significant energy savings in laser cutting processes.

Abstract: This research addresses the significant challenges of energy consumption and environmental impact in laser cutting by proposing novel deep learning (DL) methodologies to achieve energy reduction. Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EGSA improves transparent object perception by using edge-guided fusion between semantic and geometric features, with progressive training from RGB to depth-derived edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent objects challenge computer vision due to transparency confounding depth estimation and semantic segmentation, with existing multi-task approaches suffering from negative cross-task interactions.

Method: Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA) fusion mechanism incorporating boundary information, plus multi-modal progressive training transitioning from RGB-derived edges to depth-derived edges.

Result: Consistently improved depth accuracy over state-of-the-art MODEST on Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, with largest improvements in transparent regions, while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

Conclusion: Edge-guided fusion is a robust approach for improving transparent object perception, eliminating need for ground-truth depth during training.

Abstract: Transparent object perception remains a major challenge in computer vision research, as transparency confounds both depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current KD methods rely on both logit-based and feature-based losses, but this work explores whether feature-based losses alone can effectively transfer knowledge from teacher to student models.

Method: Introduces a feature KD framework using feature-based losses exclusively, with a knowledge quality metric to identify the most effective teacher layers for distillation based on latent representation geometry.

Conclusion: Feature-based knowledge distillation without logit-based losses is highly effective, and the proposed knowledge quality metric successfully identifies optimal teacher layers for improved distillation performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) methods can transfer knowledge of a parameter-heavy teacher model to a light-weight student model. The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches. We publically share our code to facilitate future work at https://github.com/Thegolfingocto/KD_wo_CE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FinCriticalED is a visual benchmark for evaluating OCR and vision language models on financial documents at the fact level, focusing on domain-critical factual correctness rather than surface-level text similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial documents contain visually dense layouts where small OCR errors (like sign inversions or shifted dates) can lead to materially different interpretations, while traditional OCR metrics fail to capture domain-critical factual correctness.

Method: Created 500 image-HTML pairs with expert-annotated financial facts covering 700+ numerical and temporal facts, developed an LLM-as-Judge evaluation pipeline for structured fact extraction and contextual verification.

Result: Benchmarking showed strongest proprietary models achieve highest factual accuracy but substantial errors remain in visually intricate numerical and temporal contexts.

Conclusion: FinCriticalED provides a rigorous foundation for advancing visual factual precision in financial and other precision-critical domains by shifting evaluation from lexical overlap to factual correctness.

Abstract: We introduce FinCriticalED (Financial Critical Error Detection), a visual benchmark for evaluating OCR and vision language models on financial documents at the fact level. Financial documents contain visually dense and table heavy layouts where numerical and temporal information is tightly coupled with structure. In high stakes settings, small OCR mistakes such as sign inversion or shifted dates can lead to materially different interpretations, while traditional OCR metrics like ROUGE and edit distance capture only surface level text similarity. \ficriticaled provides 500 image-HTML pairs with expert annotated financial facts covering over seven hundred numerical and temporal facts. It introduces three key contributions. First, it establishes the first fact level evaluation benchmark for financial document understanding, shifting evaluation from lexical overlap to domain critical factual correctness. Second, all annotations are created and verified by financial experts with strict quality control over signs, magnitudes, and temporal expressions. Third, we develop an LLM-as-Judge evaluation pipeline that performs structured fact extraction and contextual verification for visually complex financial documents. We benchmark OCR systems, open source vision language models, and proprietary models on FinCriticalED. Results show that although the strongest proprietary models achieve the highest factual accuracy, substantial errors remain in visually intricate numerical and temporal contexts. Through quantitative evaluation and expert case studies, FinCriticalED provides a rigorous foundation for advancing visual factual precision in financial and other precision critical domains.

TL;DR: CKDA addresses collaborative forgetting in Visible-Infrared Lifelong Re-ID by disentangling modality-common and modality-specific knowledge using prompting modules and aligning them in balanced feature spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for VI-LReID suffer from mutual interference between modality-specific knowledge acquisition and modality-common knowledge anti-forgetting, leading to collaborative forgetting.

Method: Proposes Cross-modality Knowledge Disentanglement and Alignment (CKDA) with Modality-Common Prompting (MCP) and Modality-Specific Prompting (MSP) modules to separate knowledge, and Cross-modal Knowledge Alignment (CKA) module for balanced feature alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of CKDA over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CKDA successfully addresses collaborative forgetting in VI-LReID by explicitly disentangling and aligning modality knowledge in a balanced manner.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (LReID) aims to match the same person employing continuously collected individual data from different scenarios. To achieve continuous all-day person matching across day and night, Visible-Infrared Lifelong person Re-IDentification (VI-LReID) focuses on sequential training on data from visible and infrared modalities and pursues average performance over all data. To this end, existing methods typically exploit cross-modal knowledge distillation to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge. However, these methods ignore the mutual interference of modality-specific knowledge acquisition and modality-common knowledge anti-forgetting, where conflicting knowledge leads to collaborative forgetting. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Cross-modality Knowledge Disentanglement and Alignment method, called CKDA, which explicitly separates and preserves modality-specific knowledge and modality-common knowledge in a balanced way. Specifically, a Modality-Common Prompting (MCP) module and a Modality-Specific Prompting (MSP) module are proposed to explicitly disentangle and purify discriminative information that coexists and is specific to different modalities, avoiding the mutual interference between both knowledge. In addition, a Cross-modal Knowledge Alignment (CKA) module is designed to further align the disentangled new knowledge with the old one in two mutually independent inter- and intra-modality feature spaces based on dual-modality prototypes in a balanced manner. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of our CKDA against state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed representation enables more scalable hologram estimation by significantly reducing the parameter search space while maintaining high fidelity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: We propose a new hologram representation based on structured complex-valued 2D Gaussian primitives, which replaces per-pixel information storage and reduces the parameter search space by up to 10:1. To enable end-to-end training, we develop a differentiable rasterizer for our representation, integrated with a GPU-optimized light propagation kernel in free space. Our extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to 2.5x lower VRAM usage and 50% faster optimization while producing higher-fidelity reconstructions than existing methods. We further introduce a conversion procedure that adapts our representation to practical hologram formats, including smooth and random phase-only holograms. Our experiments show that this procedure can effectively suppress noise artifacts observed in previous methods. By reducing the hologram parameter search space, our representation enables a more scalable hologram estimation in the next-generation computer-generated holography systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Computer vision models show developmental alignment with human mathematical cognition, matching children's learning trajectories in geometry and number concepts during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether computer vision models exhibit developmental alignment - whether their performance improvements during training mirror the developmental progressions observed in children's mathematical understanding.

Method: Case study of ResNet-50 model analyzing its learning progression for geometric and numerical concepts, comparing model performance across training epochs with known developmental trajectories in children.

Result: Found developmental alignment for some geometric concepts (Euclidean Geometry, Geometrical Figures, Metric Properties, Topology) but not others (Chiral Figures, Geometric Transformations, Symmetrical Figures). Also observed alignment in emergence of human-like mental number line representation.

Conclusion: Computer vision models show promise for understanding human mathematical development, with findings pointing to future research on additional architectures and larger benchmarks.

Abstract: Mathematical thinking is a fundamental aspect of human cognition. Cognitive scientists have investigated the mechanisms that underlie our ability to thinking geometrically and numerically, to take two prominent examples, and developmental scientists have documented the trajectories of these abilities over the lifespan. Prior research has shown that computer vision (CV) models trained on the unrelated task of image classification nevertheless learn latent representations of geometric and numerical concepts similar to those of adults. Building on this demonstrated cognitive alignment, the current study investigates whether CV models also show developmental alignment: whether their performance improvements across training to match the developmental progressions observed in children. In a detailed case study of the ResNet-50 model, we show that this is the case. For the case of geometry and topology, we find developmental alignment for some classes of concepts (Euclidean Geometry, Geometrical Figures, Metric Properties, Topology) but not others (Chiral Figures, Geometric Transformations, Symmetrical Figures). For the case of number, we find developmental alignment in the emergence of a human-like ``mental number line'' representation with experience. These findings show the promise of computer vision models for understanding the development of mathematical understanding in humans. They point the way to future research exploring additional model architectures and building larger benchmarks.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of HOI detection and generation through unified token space effectively promotes knowledge sharing and enhances generalization capabilities, advancing comprehensive interaction understanding.

Abstract: In the field of human-object interaction (HOI), detection and generation are two dual tasks that have traditionally been addressed separately, hindering the development of comprehensive interaction understanding. To address this, we propose UniHOI, which jointly models HOI detection and generation via a unified token space, thereby effectively promoting knowledge sharing and enhancing generalization. Specifically, we introduce a symmetric interaction-aware attention module and a unified semi-supervised learning paradigm, enabling effective bidirectional mapping between images and interaction semantics even under limited annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in both HOI detection and generation. Specifically, UniHOI improves accuracy by 4.9% on long-tailed HOI detection and boosts interaction metrics by 42.0% on open-vocabulary generation tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes DLRRF model to handle spectral variability and spatial changes in HSI-MSI fusion by modeling spectral degradation and decomposing target HSI into low-rank and residual components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods handle inter-image variability through direct transformations that worsen the ill-posedness of fusion models, requiring a better approach to address spectral variability and spatially localized changes.

Method: Models spectral variability as changes in spectral degradation operator, decomposes target HSI into low-rank and residual components for detail recovery, performs dimensionality reduction, and uses PAO algorithm with PnP framework and external denoiser.

Result: Extensive experiments show DLRRF achieves superior performance in fusing HSI and MSI with inter-image variability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DLRRF model effectively handles inter-image variability in HSI-MSI fusion through degradation modeling and component decomposition, demonstrating improved fusion performance.

Abstract: The fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) with multispectral image (MSI) provides an effective way to enhance the spatial resolution of HSI. However, due to different acquisition conditions, there may exist spectral variability and spatially localized changes between HSI and MSI, referred to as inter-image variability, which can significantly affect the fusion performance. Existing methods typically handle inter-image variability by applying direct transformations to the images themselves, which can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the fusion model. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-based Low-Rank and Residual Fusion (DLRRF) model. First, we model the spectral variability as change in the spectral degradation operator. Second, to recover the lost spatial details caused by spatially localized changes, we decompose the target HSI into low rank and residual components, where the latter is used to capture the lost details. By exploiting the spectral correlation within the images, we perform dimensionality reduction on both components. Additionally, we introduce an implicit regularizer to utilize the spatial prior information from the images. The proposed DLRRF model is solved using the Proximal Alternating Optimization (PAO) algorithm within a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, where the subproblem regarding implicit regularizer is addressed by an external denoiser. We further provide a comprehensive convergence analysis of the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that DLRRF achieves superior performance in fusing HSI and MSI with inter-image variability.

Abstract: Accurate nuclei segmentation in microscopy whole slide images (WSIs) remains challenging due to variability in staining, imaging conditions, and tissue morphology. We propose CellGenNet, a knowledge distillation framework for robust cross-tissue cell segmentation under limited supervision. CellGenNet adopts a student-teacher architecture, where a capacity teacher is trained on sparse annotations and generates soft pseudo-labels for unlabeled regions. The student is optimized using a joint objective that integrates ground-truth labels, teacher-derived probabilistic targets, and a hybrid loss function combining binary cross-entropy and Tversky loss, enabling asymmetric penalties to mitigate class imbalance and better preserve minority nuclear structures. Consistency regularization and layerwise dropout further stabilize feature representations and promote reliable feature transfer.

*Keito Sasagawa,Shuhei Kurita,Daisuke Kawahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Existing MLLMs perform poorly on vertically written Japanese text compared to horizontal text, but fine-tuning with synthesized Japanese OCR data improves vertical text understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Japanese documents often use vertical writing, but current MLLMs lack sufficient support for vertical text understanding, creating a gap in visual document understanding capabilities.

Method: Created synthetic Japanese OCR dataset with both horizontal and vertical text, plus real-world vertical document images. Used these datasets for fine-tuning and evaluating MLLMs on vertical text reading.

Result: Existing MLLMs showed significantly worse performance on vertically written Japanese text than horizontal text. Fine-tuning with the synthesized dataset substantially improved vertical text understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: Specialized training data is crucial for MLLMs to handle vertical Japanese text effectively, and the proposed dataset successfully addresses this limitation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen rapid advances in recent years and are now being applied to visual document understanding tasks. They are expected to process a wide range of document images across languages, including Japanese. Understanding documents from images requires models to read what are written in them. Since some Japanese documents are written vertically, support for vertical writing is essential. However, research specifically focused on vertically written Japanese text remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the reading capability of existing MLLMs on vertically written Japanese text. First, we generate a synthetic Japanese OCR dataset by rendering Japanese texts into images, and use it for both model fine-tuning and evaluation. This dataset includes Japanese text in both horizontal and vertical writing. We also create an evaluation dataset sourced from the real-world document images containing vertically written Japanese text. Using these datasets, we demonstrate that the existing MLLMs perform worse on vertically written Japanese text than on horizontally written Japanese text. Furthermore, we show that training MLLMs on our synthesized Japanese OCR dataset results in improving the performance of models that previously could not handle vertical writing. The datasets and code are publicly available https://github.com/llm-jp/eval_vertical_ja.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether video models can reason through video generation, leveraging video's explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning.

Method: Created VR-Bench with 7,920 procedurally generated videos across 5 maze types and diverse visual styles, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to elicit reasoning ability in video models.

Result: Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception than leading VLMs, generalize well across scenarios, and show 10-20% reliability improvement through diverse sampling during inference (test-time scaling effect).

Conclusion: Video models have unique potential for spatial reasoning tasks via video generation, demonstrating scalability and strong reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Video Models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity video generation with coherent motion dynamics. Analogous to the development from text generation to text-based reasoning in language modeling, the development of video models motivates us to ask: Can video models reason via video generation? Compared with the discrete text corpus, video grounds reasoning in explicit spatial layouts and temporal continuity, which serves as an ideal substrate for spatial reasoning. In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%. These findings highlight the unique potential and scalability of reasoning via video for spatial reasoning tasks.

Motivation: Current bokeh rendering methods require accurate depth maps or suffer from limited controllability and efficiency, creating a need for depth-free controllable approaches.

Method: Uses flow matching framework with cross-attention mechanism to synthesize bokeh effects directly from all-in-focus images, enabling semantic control over focus regions and blur intensity through text prompts.

Result: Achieves visually compelling bokeh effects with precise control, outperforming existing depth-dependent and generative methods in both rendering quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: BokehFlow provides an effective depth-free solution for controllable bokeh rendering, eliminating the need for depth inputs while maintaining high quality and efficiency.

Abstract: Bokeh rendering simulates the shallow depth-of-field effect in photography, enhancing visual aesthetics and guiding viewer attention to regions of interest. Although recent approaches perform well, rendering controllable bokeh without additional depth inputs remains a significant challenge. Existing classical and neural controllable methods rely on accurate depth maps, while generative approaches often struggle with limited controllability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose BokehFlow, a depth-free framework for controllable bokeh rendering based on flow matching. BokehFlow directly synthesizes photorealistic bokeh effects from all-in-focus images, eliminating the need for depth inputs. It employs a cross-attention mechanism to enable semantic control over both focus regions and blur intensity via text prompts. To support training and evaluation, we collect and synthesize four datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BokehFlow achieves visually compelling bokeh effects and offers precise control, outperforming existing depth-dependent and generative methods in both rendering quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: MambaTrack3D achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off with robust performance across both specialized HTV and conventional tracking scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Dynamic outdoor environments with high temporal variation (HTV) pose significant challenges for 3D single object tracking in LiDAR point clouds. Existing memory-based trackers often suffer from quadratic computational complexity, temporal redundancy, and insufficient exploitation of geometric priors. To address these issues, we propose MambaTrack3D, a novel HTV-oriented tracking framework built upon the state space model Mamba. Specifically, we design a Mamba-based Inter-frame Propagation (MIP) module that replaces conventional single-frame feature extraction with efficient inter-frame propagation, achieving near-linear complexity while explicitly modeling spatial relations across historical frames. Furthermore, a Grouped Feature Enhancement Module (GFEM) is introduced to separate foreground and background semantics at the channel level, thereby mitigating temporal redundancy in the memory bank. Extensive experiments on KITTI-HTV and nuScenes-HTV benchmarks demonstrate that MambaTrack3D consistently outperforms both HTV-oriented and normal-scenario trackers, achieving improvements of up to 6.5 success and 9.5 precision over HVTrack under moderate temporal gaps. On the standard KITTI dataset, MambaTrack3D remains highly competitive with state-of-the-art normal-scenario trackers, confirming its strong generalization ability. Overall, MambaTrack3D achieves a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off, delivering robust performance across both specialized HTV and conventional tracking scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TiCAL addresses inter-modal emotion conflicts in MER by using typicality-based consistency estimation and hyperbolic feature embedding to improve recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER approaches overlook inter-modal emotion conflicts where different modalities in the same sample express divergent emotional tendencies, limiting recognition accuracy.

Method: Proposes TiCAL framework that dynamically assesses sample consistency using pseudo unimodal labels and typicality estimation, with hyperbolic space embedding for fine-grained emotion representation.

Result: Achieves about 2.6% improvement over state-of-the-art DMD on benchmark datasets CMU-MOSEI and MER2023, particularly effective on samples with high modality inconsistency.

Conclusion: TiCAL effectively mitigates inter-modal emotional conflicts and enhances overall multimodal emotion recognition performance through consistency-aware learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) aims to accurately identify human emotional states by integrating heterogeneous modalities such as visual, auditory, and textual data. Existing approaches predominantly rely on unified emotion labels to supervise model training, often overlooking a critical challenge: inter-modal emotion conflicts, wherein different modalities within the same sample may express divergent emotional tendencies. In this work, we address this overlooked issue by proposing a novel framework, Typicality-based Consistent-aware Multimodal Emotion Recognition (TiCAL), inspired by the stage-wise nature of human emotion perception. TiCAL dynamically assesses the consistency of each training sample by leveraging pseudo unimodal emotion labels alongside a typicality estimation. To further enhance emotion representation, we embed features in a hyperbolic space, enabling the capture of fine-grained distinctions among emotional categories. By incorporating consistency estimates into the learning process, our method improves model performance, particularly on samples exhibiting high modality inconsistency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, e.g, CMU-MOSEI and MER2023, validate the effectiveness of TiCAL in mitigating inter-modal emotional conflicts and enhancing overall recognition accuracy, e.g., with about 2.6% improvements over the state-of-the-art DMD.

*Chengyu Xie,Zhi Gong,Junchi Ren,Linkun Yu,Si Shen,Fei Shen,Xiaoyu Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JCDM is a jointly conditioned diffusion framework that uses multi-view priors for pose-guided human image generation, addressing incomplete textures from single views and lack of cross-view interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pose-guided human image generation suffers from incomplete textures when using only single reference views and lacks explicit cross-view interaction mechanisms.

Method: Uses appearance prior module (APM) to infer holistic identity preserving prior from incomplete references, and joint conditional injection (JCI) mechanism to fuse multi-view cues and inject shared conditioning into denoising backbone.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and cross-view consistency, supports variable number of reference views, and integrates with standard diffusion backbones with minimal architectural modifications.

Conclusion: JCDM effectively addresses limitations in pose-guided human image generation by leveraging multi-view priors and joint conditioning mechanisms.

Abstract: Pose-guided human image generation is limited by incomplete textures from single reference views and the absence of explicit cross-view interaction. We present jointly conditioned diffusion model (JCDM), a jointly conditioned diffusion framework that exploits multi-view priors. The appearance prior module (APM) infers a holistic identity preserving prior from incomplete references, and the joint conditional injection (JCI) mechanism fuses multi-view cues and injects shared conditioning into the denoising backbone to align identity, color, and texture across poses. JCDM supports a variable number of reference views and integrates with standard diffusion backbones with minimal and targeted architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate state of the art fidelity and cross-view consistency.

*Duo Li,Zuhao Yang,Xiaoqin Zhang,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper analyzes visual token redundancy in discrete diffusion-based multimodal large language models (dMLLMs) and proposes modality-specific efficiency optimizations, revealing different optimal strategies for from-scratch vs AR-to-diffusion dMLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dMLLMs suffer from significant computational overhead during inference due to full-sequence attention computation, and current efficiency optimizations overlook modality-specific visual token redundancy.

Method: Conducted comprehensive study on visual token redundancy evolution across different dMLLM architectures and tasks, analyzing how visual token pruning affects responses and efficiency through systematic experiments.

Result: Found that visual redundancy emerges only in from-scratch dMLLMs during long-answer tasks; from-scratch dMLLMs can recover pruned information progressively; layer-skipping works best for AR-to-diffusion dMLLMs while progressive/late-step pruning is optimal for from-scratch dMLLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides new modality-specific efficiency optimization perspectives for dMLLMs, advancing their applicability across multimodal understanding tasks through architecture-aware acceleration strategies.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion-based multimodal large language models (dMLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive MLLMs thanks to their advantages in parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling, but most existing dMLLMs incur significant computational overhead during inference due to the full-sequence attention computation in each denoising step. Pioneer studies attempt to resolve this issue from a modality-agnostic perspective via key-value cache optimization or efficient sampling but most of them overlook modality-specific visual token redundancy. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on how visual token redundancy evolves with different dMLLM architectures and tasks and how visual token pruning affects dMLLM responses and efficiency. Specifically, our study reveals that visual redundancy emerges only in from-scratch dMLLMs while handling long-answer tasks. In addition, we validate that visual token pruning introduces non-negligible information loss in dMLLMs and only from-scratch dMLLMs can recover the lost information progressively during late denoising steps. Furthermore, our study shows that layer-skipping is promising for accelerating AR-to-diffusion dMLLMs, whereas progressive or late-step pruning is more effective for from-scratch dMLLMs. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on efficiency optimization for dMLLMs, greatly advancing their applicability across various multimodal understanding tasks.

*Junseo Koo,Jinseo Jeong,Gunhee Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Gaussian Blending to replace alpha blending in 3D Gaussian Splatting, addressing blurring and staircase artifacts at unseen sampling rates while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3DGS methods suffer from erosion-induced blurring when zooming in and dilation-induced staircase artifacts when zooming out at sampling rates unseen during training, due to limitations of conventional alpha blending.

Method: Replaces alpha blending with Gaussian Blending that treats alpha and transmittance as spatially varying distributions rather than scalar quantities, allowing nearby background splats to contribute to rendering.

Result: Effectively captures fine details at various unseen sampling rates, outperforms existing novel view synthesis models across both unseen and seen sampling rates, maintains real-time rendering speed with no additional memory cost.

Conclusion: Gaussian Blending provides a drop-in replacement for alpha blending that solves visual artifacts at unseen sampling rates while preserving the efficiency advantages of 3DGS frameworks.

Abstract: The recent introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced novel view synthesis. Several studies have further improved the rendering quality of 3DGS, yet they still exhibit noticeable visual discrepancies when synthesizing views at sampling rates unseen during training. Specifically, they suffer from (i) erosion-induced blurring artifacts when zooming in and (ii) dilation-induced staircase artifacts when zooming out. We speculate that these artifacts arise from the fundamental limitation of the alpha blending adopted in 3DGS methods. Instead of the conventional alpha blending that computes alpha and transmittance as scalar quantities over a pixel, we propose to replace it with our novel Gaussian Blending that treats alpha and transmittance as spatially varying distributions. Thus, transmittances can be updated considering the spatial distribution of alpha values across the pixel area, allowing nearby background splats to contribute to the final rendering. Our Gaussian Blending maintains real-time rendering speed and requires no additional memory cost, while being easily integrated as a drop-in replacement into existing 3DGS-based or other NVS frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Blending effectively captures fine details at various sampling rates unseen during training, consistently outperforming existing novel view synthesis models across both unseen and seen sampling rates.

*Firdavs Nasriddinov,Rafal Kocielnik,Anima Anandkumar,Andrew J. Hung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A structure-aware pipeline that learns surgical action ontology from trainer transcripts and uses Instrument-Action-Target triplets to generate clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback for surgical training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate natural, trainer-style feedback for surgical trainees to provide timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale, requiring models that understand clinically relevant representations.

Method: Mine IAT triplets from real feedback text, fine-tune video-to-IAT model with surgical context and temporal tracking, and use IAT representations to guide GPT-4o for feedback generation.

Result: Improved AUC for Video-to-IAT recognition (Instrument: 0.67→0.74, Action: 0.60→0.63, Tissue: 0.74→0.79) and feedback generation fidelity increased from 2.17 to 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling admissible generations from 21% to 42%.

Conclusion: Grounding feedback generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity, yields clinician-verifiable rationales, and supports auditable use in surgical training.

Abstract: High-quality intraoperative feedback from a surgical trainer is pivotal for improving trainee performance and long-term skill acquisition. Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.

### [64] [Unbiased Semantic Decoding with Vision Foundation Models for Few-shot Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15118)
*Jin Wang,Bingfeng Zhang,Jian Pang,Weifeng Liu,Baodi Liu,Honglong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Unbiased Semantic Decoding (USD) strategy that integrates SAM with CLIP to improve few-shot segmentation by extracting target information from both support and query sets, avoiding biased decoding from SAM's prompt dependency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous approaches using SAM for few-shot segmentation focus only on extracting prompts from support sets, which is insufficient to activate SAM's generalization ability and results in biased decoding for unknown classes.

Method: Proposes USD strategy with two feature enhancement methods: global supplement at image level using CLIP semantics with support images, and local guidance at pixel level using query images. Also introduces a learnable visual-text target prompt generator.

Result: The method enhances SAM's semantic discrimination without retraining foundation models, allowing features to focus on target regions through rich target information in prompts.

Conclusion: The USD strategy effectively addresses SAM's prompt dependency issue in few-shot segmentation by leveraging CLIP's semantic alignment capabilities for unbiased semantic decoding across support and query sets.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation has garnered significant attention. Many recent approaches attempt to introduce the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to handle this task. With the strong generalization ability and rich object-specific extraction ability of the SAM model, such a solution shows great potential in few-shot segmentation. However, the decoding process of SAM highly relies on accurate and explicit prompts, making previous approaches mainly focus on extracting prompts from the support set, which is insufficient to activate the generalization ability of SAM, and this design is easy to result in a biased decoding process when adapting to the unknown classes. In this work, we propose an Unbiased Semantic Decoding (USD) strategy integrated with SAM, which extracts target information from both the support and query set simultaneously to perform consistent predictions guided by the semantics of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model. Specifically, to enhance the unbiased semantic discrimination of SAM, we design two feature enhancement strategies that leverage the semantic alignment capability of CLIP to enrich the original SAM features, mainly including a global supplement at the image level to provide a generalize category indicate with support image and a local guidance at the pixel level to provide a useful target location with query image. Besides, to generate target-focused prompt embeddings, a learnable visual-text target prompt generator is proposed by interacting target text embeddings and clip visual features. Without requiring re-training of the vision foundation models, the features with semantic discrimination draw attention to the target region through the guidance of prompt with rich target information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveFuse-AL is a multi-strategy active learning framework that adaptively fuses BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet strategies using cyclical temporal priors and performance-driven adaptation for medical imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Individual active learning strategies often show inconsistent performance across different stages of the learning cycle, leading to suboptimal sample selection and inefficient use of annotation budgets in medical imaging.

Method: Proposed WaveFuse-AL framework that integrates cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation to dynamically adjust the importance of multiple acquisition strategies (BALD, BADGE, Entropy, CoreSet) throughout the active learning process.

Result: WaveFuse-AL consistently outperformed single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines across three medical imaging benchmarks (APTOS-2019, RSNA Pneumonia Detection, ISIC-2018), achieving statistically significant improvements on 10 out of 12 metric measurements.

Conclusion: The proposed cyclical and performance-adaptive multi-strategy approach effectively maximizes the utility of limited annotation budgets in medical imaging by adaptively combining the strengths of different acquisition strategies throughout the learning process.

Abstract: Active learning reduces annotation costs in medical imaging by strategically selecting the most informative samples for labeling. However, individual acquisition strategies often exhibit inconsistent behavior across different stages of the active learning cycle. We propose Cyclical and Performance-Adaptive Multi-Strategy Active Learning (WaveFuse-AL), a novel framework that adaptively fuses multiple established acquisition strategies-BALD, BADGE, Entropy, and CoreSet throughout the learning process. WaveFuse-AL integrates cyclical (sinusoidal) temporal priors with performance-driven adaptation to dynamically adjust strategy importance over time. We evaluate WaveFuse-AL on three medical imaging benchmarks: APTOS-2019 (multi-class classification), RSNA Pneumonia Detection (binary classification), and ISIC-2018 (skin lesion segmentation). Experimental results demonstrate that WaveFuse-AL consistently outperforms both single-strategy and alternating-strategy baselines, achieving statistically significant performance improvements (on ten out of twelve metric measurements) while maximizing the utility of limited annotation budgets.

TL;DR: DCL-SE is a framework that uses dynamic curriculum learning and data-driven spatiotemporal encoding to improve neuroimaging analysis, outperforming existing methods across multiple brain-related tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in high-dimensional neuroimaging analysis including spatiotemporal fidelity compromises and limited adaptability of large-scale models.

Method: Uses Approximate Rank Pooling to encode 3D brain data into 2D dynamic representations, then employs dynamic curriculum learning with Dynamic Group Mechanism to progressively train decoder from global to fine details.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability across six datasets including Alzheimer's disease classification, brain tumor classification, cerebral artery segmentation, and brain age prediction.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the importance of compact, task-specific architectures in the era of large-scale pretrained networks.

Abstract: High-dimensional neuroimaging analyses for clinical diagnosis are often constrained by compromises in spatiotemporal fidelity and by the limited adaptability of large-scale, general-purpose models. To address these challenges, we introduce Dynamic Curriculum Learning for Spatiotemporal Encoding (DCL-SE), an end-to-end framework centered on data-driven spatiotemporal encoding (DaSE). We leverage Approximate Rank Pooling (ARP) to efficiently encode three-dimensional volumetric brain data into information-rich, two-dimensional dynamic representations, and then employ a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, guided by a Dynamic Group Mechanism (DGM), to progressively train the decoder, refining feature extraction from global anatomical structures to fine pathological details. Evaluated across six publicly available datasets, including Alzheimer's disease and brain tumor classification, cerebral artery segmentation, and brain age prediction, DCL-SE consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. These findings underscore the critical importance of compact, task-specific architectures in the era of large-scale pretrained networks.

TL;DR: SceneEdited is the first city-scale dataset for HD map maintenance through 3D point cloud updating, containing over 800 scenes with 23,000+ synthesized changes across 2000+ outdated versions, along with baseline methods and toolkit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD maps quickly become outdated as environments evolve, creating a need for robust methods that not only detect changes but also incorporate them into updated 3D representations. There's a gap between detecting changes and actually updating 3D maps, especially when relying on 2D image-based change detection.

Method: Created SceneEdited dataset with over 800 up-to-date scenes covering 73 km of driving and 3 km² urban area, with 23,000+ synthesized object changes across 2000+ out-of-date versions. Provided baseline methods using foundational image-based structure-from-motion pipeline for updating outdated scenes, and comprehensive toolkit supporting scalability and portability.

Result: Dataset contains calibrated RGB images, LiDAR scans, and detailed change masks for training and evaluation. Toolkit supports scalability, trackability, and portability for future dataset expansion and unification of out-of-date object annotations.

Conclusion: SceneEdited establishes a standardized benchmark for 3D map updating research, with both dataset and toolkit publicly available to support HD map maintenance through 3D point cloud updating.

Abstract: Accurate, up-to-date High-Definition (HD) maps are critical for urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, and autonomous navigation. However, these maps quickly become outdated as environments evolve, creating a need for robust methods that not only detect changes but also incorporate them into updated 3D representations. While change detection techniques have advanced significantly, there remains a clear gap between detecting changes and actually updating 3D maps, particularly when relying on 2D image-based change detection. To address this gap, we introduce SceneEdited, the first city-scale dataset explicitly designed to support research on HD map maintenance through 3D point cloud updating. SceneEdited contains over 800 up-to-date scenes covering 73 km of driving and approximate 3 $\text{km}^2$ of urban area, with more than 23,000 synthesized object changes created both manually and automatically across 2000+ out-of-date versions, simulating realistic urban modifications such as missing roadside infrastructure, buildings, overpasses, and utility poles. Each scene includes calibrated RGB images, LiDAR scans, and detailed change masks for training and evaluation. We also provide baseline methods using a foundational image-based structure-from-motion pipeline for updating outdated scenes, as well as a comprehensive toolkit supporting scalability, trackability, and portability for future dataset expansion and unification of out-of-date object annotations. Both the dataset and the toolkit are publicly available at https://github.com/ChadLin9596/ScenePoint-ETK, establising a standardized benchmark for 3D map updating research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces AUI-Gym, a benchmark for automatic GUI development, and proposes a Coder-CUA collaboration framework where coding models design GUIs and computer-use agents evaluate them based on task solvability rather than visual aesthetics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GUIs are designed for humans, forcing agents to adopt inefficient human-oriented behaviors. The paper explores whether computer-use agents can serve as judges to assist coding models in automatic GUI design for better agent-native efficiency.

Method: Developed AUI-Gym benchmark with 52 applications and 1560 synthesized tasks, created a verifier for task executability, and proposed a Coder-CUA collaboration framework where Coder generates websites and CUA evaluates functionality through navigation success.

Result: The framework enables automatic GUI design focused on task solvability and navigation success rates, with CUA feedback compressed into visual summaries via a Dashboard for iterative redesign.

Conclusion: Positioning agents as both designers and judges shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability, moving agents from passive use to active participation in digital environments.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUA) are becoming increasingly capable of autonomously operating digital environments through Graphical User Interfaces (GUI). Yet, most GUI remain designed primarily for humans--prioritizing aesthetics and usability--forcing agents to adopt human-oriented behaviors that are unnecessary for efficient task execution. At the same time, rapid advances in coding-oriented language models (Coder) have transformed automatic GUI design. This raises a fundamental question: Can CUA as judges to assist Coder for automatic GUI design? To investigate, we introduce AUI-Gym, a benchmark for Automatic GUI development spanning 52 applications across diverse domains. Using language models, we synthesize 1560 tasks that simulate real-world scenarios. To ensure task reliability, we further develop a verifier that programmatically checks whether each task is executable within its environment. Building on this, we propose a Coder-CUA in Collaboration framework: the Coder acts as Designer, generating and revising websites, while the CUA serves as Judge, evaluating functionality and refining designs. Success is measured not by visual appearance, but by task solvability and CUA navigation success rate. To turn CUA feedback into usable guidance, we design a CUA Dashboard that compresses multi-step navigation histories into concise visual summaries, offering interpretable guidance for iterative redesign. By positioning agents as both designers and judges, our framework shifts interface design toward agent-native efficiency and reliability. Our work takes a step toward shifting agents from passive use toward active participation in digital environments. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/showlab/AUI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal continual learning faces catastrophic forgetting where learning new tasks degrades performance on previous ones, limiting practical deployment of multimodal large language models.

Method: Approximates missing gradients using directional vector between current and previous optimal parameters, integrates with limited replay buffer gradients, and uses Bernoulli sampling to balance stability and plasticity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal continual instruction tuning datasets without model expansion, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: The geometric gradient approximation approach successfully addresses catastrophic forgetting in multimodal continual learning while maintaining compact model architecture.

Abstract: Multimodal continual instruction tuning enables multimodal large language models to sequentially adapt to new tasks while building upon previously acquired knowledge. However, this continual learning paradigm faces the significant challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where learning new tasks leads to performance degradation on previous ones. In this paper, we introduce a novel insight into catastrophic forgetting by conceptualizing it as a problem of missing gradients from old tasks during new task learning. Our approach approximates these missing gradients by leveraging the geometric properties of the parameter space, specifically using the directional vector between current parameters and previously optimal parameters as gradient guidance. This approximated gradient can be further integrated with real gradients from a limited replay buffer and regulated by a Bernoulli sampling strategy that dynamically balances model stability and plasticity. Extensive experiments on multimodal continual instruction tuning datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without model expansion, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining a compact architecture.

TL;DR: SEC-Depth is a self-evolution contrastive learning framework that improves self-supervised depth estimation robustness under adverse weather conditions by leveraging historical latency models as negative samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-supervised depth estimation methods suffer significant performance degradation under adverse weather conditions like rain and fog, where reduced visibility impairs depth prediction accuracy.

Method: Proposes a self-evolution contrastive learning framework that uses intermediate training parameters to construct temporally evolving latency models, with a dynamic update strategy and self-evolution contrastive loss (SECL) that treats historical model outputs as negative samples.

Result: The method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations under challenging weather conditions.

Conclusion: SEC-Depth effectively mitigates performance loss in adverse weather conditions through adaptive learning objectives that implicitly sense weather degradation severity, reducing manual intervention needs.

Abstract: Self-supervised depth estimation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog, where reduced visibility critically impairs depth prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention. Experiments show that our method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Test-time thinking in vision language models doesn't always help - long reasoning chains can ignore images and perform worse than standard mode. Short lookback phrases that reference images correlate with success, leading to a new uncertainty-guided lookback decoding method that improves performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite promising results from test-time thinking in vision language models, there's no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning performance.

Method: Large-scale controlled comparison of thinking variants on LVLMs, followed by development of uncertainty-guided lookback - a training-free decoding strategy combining uncertainty signals with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search.

Result: More thinking is not always better; long chains often ignore images and underperform. Short lookback phrases that reference images correlate with better visual grounding. The proposed method improves MMMU performance, delivers largest gains where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: The uncertainty-guided lookback decoding strategy sets new state-of-the-art performance under fixed model families and token budgets, and generalizes well across multiple benchmarks including multimodal suites and math-focused visual reasoning datasets.

Abstract: Test-time thinking (that is, generating explicit intermediate reasoning chains) is known to boost performance in large language models and has recently shown strong gains for large vision language models (LVLMs). However, despite these promising results, there is still no systematic analysis of how thinking actually affects visual reasoning. We provide the first such analysis with a large scale, controlled comparison of thinking for LVLMs, evaluating ten variants from the InternVL3.5 and Qwen3-VL families on MMMU-val under generous token budgets and multi pass decoding. We show that more thinking is not always better; long chains often yield long wrong trajectories that ignore the image and underperform the same models run in standard instruct mode. A deeper analysis reveals that certain short lookback phrases, which explicitly refer back to the image, are strongly enriched in successful trajectories and correlate with better visual grounding. Building on this insight, we propose uncertainty guided lookback, a training free decoding strategy that combines an uncertainty signal with adaptive lookback prompts and breadth search. Our method improves overall MMMU performance, delivers the largest gains in categories where standard thinking is weak, and outperforms several strong decoding baselines, setting a new state of the art under fixed model families and token budgets. We further show that this decoding strategy generalizes, yielding consistent improvements on five additional benchmarks, including two broad multimodal suites and math focused visual reasoning datasets.

### [72] [MMCM: Multimodality-aware Metric using Clustering-based Modes for Probabilistic Human Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15179)
*Kyotaro Tokoro,Hiromu Taketsugu,Norimichi Ukita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MMCM, a novel metric for evaluating multimodal human motion prediction that assesses both coverage across motion modes and kinematic validity, addressing limitations of existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics for multimodal human motion prediction fail to properly evaluate both coverage across diverse motion modes and kinematic validity, often rewarding widely distributed motions even if they're invalid or concentrated in single modes.

Method: MMCM uses clustering to divide motion space into modes, explicitly evaluating coverage across multiple modes. It identifies valid modes by collecting possible future motions from datasets to assess kinematic validity.

Result: Experiments validate that the clustering approach yields sensible mode definitions and MMCM accurately scores multimodal predictions according to both coverage and validity criteria.

Conclusion: MMCM provides a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multimodal human motion prediction that properly assesses both diversity across motion modes and kinematic plausibility.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel metric for Human Motion Prediction (HMP). Since a single past sequence can lead to multiple possible futures, a probabilistic HMP method predicts such multiple motions. While a single motion predicted by a deterministic method is evaluated only with the difference from its ground truth motion, multiple predicted motions should also be evaluated based on their distribution. For this evaluation, this paper focuses on the following two criteria. \textbf{(a) Coverage}: motions should be distributed among multiple motion modes to cover diverse possibilities. \textbf{(b) Validity}: motions should be kinematically valid as future motions observable from a given past motion. However, existing metrics simply appreciate widely distributed motions even if these motions are observed in a single mode and kinematically invalid. To resolve these disadvantages, this paper proposes a Multimodality-aware Metric using Clustering-based Modes (MMCM). For (a) coverage, MMCM divides a motion space into several clusters, each of which is regarded as a mode. These modes are used to explicitly evaluate whether predicted motions are distributed among multiple modes. For (b) validity, MMCM identifies valid modes by collecting possible future motions from a motion dataset.

*Yicheng He,Chengsong Huang,Zongxia Li,Jiaxin Huang,Yonghui Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisPlay is a self-evolving RL framework that enables Vision-Language Models to autonomously improve reasoning using unlabeled image data through dual roles (Questioner and Reasoner) trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for VLMs rely on costly human annotations or task-specific heuristics for rewards, which are difficult to scale for complex reasoning tasks.

Method: Assigns VLM into two roles: Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging visual questions, and Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses, trained jointly with GRPO incorporating diversity and difficulty rewards.

Result: Achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks including MM-Vet and MMMU when trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence by enabling VLMs to autonomously improve without human supervision.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled framework for improving Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However, existing RL approaches often rely on human-annotated labels or task-specific heuristics to define verifiable rewards, both of which are costly and difficult to scale. We introduce VisPlay, a self-evolving RL framework that enables VLMs to autonomously improve their reasoning abilities using large amounts of unlabeled image data. Starting from a single base VLM, VisPlay assigns the model into two interacting roles: an Image-Conditioned Questioner that formulates challenging yet answerable visual questions, and a Multimodal Reasoner that generates silver responses. These roles are jointly trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which incorporates diversity and difficulty rewards to balance the complexity of generated questions with the quality of the silver answers. VisPlay scales efficiently across two model families. When trained on Qwen2.5-VL and MiMo-VL, VisPlay achieves consistent improvements in visual reasoning, compositional generalization, and hallucination reduction across eight benchmarks, including MM-Vet and MMMU, demonstrating a scalable path toward self-evolving multimodal intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces instruction-guided lesion segmentation (ILS) for chest X-rays, creates MIMIC-ILS dataset with 1.1M instruction-answer pairs, and develops ROSALIA model that segments lesions based on simple user instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current lesion segmentation models for chest X-rays are limited by small target labels and reliance on complex expert-level text inputs, creating barriers to practical clinical use.

Method: Developed automated multimodal pipeline to generate annotations from chest X-ray images and reports, creating MIMIC-ILS dataset with 1.1M instruction-answer pairs covering 7 lesion types. Fine-tuned ROSALIA vision-language model on this dataset.

Result: ROSALIA achieves high segmentation and textual accuracy, demonstrating effective lesion segmentation based on simple user instructions. MIMIC-ILS contains 192K images and 91K unique segmentation masks.

Conclusion: The ILS paradigm and MIMIC-ILS dataset provide a foundational resource for pixel-level CXR lesion grounding, enabling user-friendly lesion segmentation without requiring expert-level text inputs.

Abstract: The applicability of current lesion segmentation models for chest X-rays (CXRs) has been limited both by a small number of target labels and the reliance on long, detailed expert-level text inputs, creating a barrier to practical use. To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm: instruction-guided lesion segmentation (ILS), which is designed to segment diverse lesion types based on simple, user-friendly instructions. Under this paradigm, we construct MIMIC-ILS, the first large-scale instruction-answer dataset for CXR lesion segmentation, using our fully automated multimodal pipeline that generates annotations from chest X-ray images and their corresponding reports. MIMIC-ILS contains 1.1M instruction-answer pairs derived from 192K images and 91K unique segmentation masks, covering seven major lesion types. To empirically demonstrate its utility, we introduce ROSALIA, a vision-language model fine-tuned on MIMIC-ILS. ROSALIA can segment diverse lesions and provide textual explanations in response to user instructions. The model achieves high segmentation and textual accuracy in our newly proposed task, highlighting the effectiveness of our pipeline and the value of MIMIC-ILS as a foundational resource for pixel-level CXR lesion grounding.

*Yushi Huang,Zining Wang,Zhihang Yuan,Yifu Ding,Ruihao Gong,Jinyang Guo,Xianglong Liu,Jun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDES is a training-free framework for efficient Mixture-of-Experts MLLM inference that adaptively skips redundant experts using global-modulated local gating and dual-modality thresholding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing expert skipping methods designed for unimodal LLMs cause significant performance degradation when applied to MLLMs, as they fail to account for heterogeneous expert contributions across layers and modality-specific token behaviors.

Method: Proposes globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) to integrate layer importance into routing probabilities, dual-modality thresholding (DMT) for separate token processing per modality, and a frontier search algorithm for optimal threshold setting.

Result: Achieves up to 10.67% performance improvement while skipping 88% experts, with 2.16x prefilling speedup and 1.26x decoding speedup across 3 model series and 13 benchmarks.

Conclusion: MoDES enables efficient and accurate MoE MLLM inference by properly addressing modality-specific expert behaviors and layer heterogeneity, significantly outperforming previous approaches.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks, but they suffer from high computational inefficiency. To reduce inference overhead, expert skipping methods have been proposed to deactivate redundant experts based on the current input tokens. However, we find that applying these methods-originally designed for unimodal large language models (LLMs)-to MLLMs results in considerable performance degradation. This is primarily because such methods fail to account for the heterogeneous contributions of experts across MoE layers and modality-specific behaviors of tokens within these layers. Motivated by these findings, we propose MoDES, the first training-free framework that adaptively skips experts to enable efficient and accurate MoE MLLM inference. It incorporates a globally-modulated local gating (GMLG) mechanism that integrates global layer-wise importance into local routing probabilities to accurately estimate per-token expert importance. A dual-modality thresholding (DMT) method is then applied, which processes tokens from each modality separately, to derive the skipping schedule. To set the optimal thresholds, we introduce a frontier search algorithm that exploits monotonicity properties, cutting convergence time from several days to a few hours. Extensive experiments for 3 model series across 13 benchmarks demonstrate that MoDES far outperforms previous approaches. For instance, when skipping 88% experts for Qwen3-VL-MoE-30B-A3B-Instruct, the performance boost is up to 10.67% (97.33% vs. 86.66%). Furthermore, MoDES significantly enhances inference speed, improving the prefilling time by 2.16$\times$ and the decoding time by 1.26$\times$.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainRotViT: A hybrid model combining vision transformers and residual CNNs for brain age estimation from MRI, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets and showing associations with neurodegenerative conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional brain age estimation methods face limitations like manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting. Pure transformers require large datasets and high computational costs, creating a need for more efficient and generalizable approaches.

Method: Hybrid architecture combining ViT encoder (pre-trained on auxiliary age/sex classification) with residual CNN regressor. ViT extracts slice-level features, frozen encoder generates 2D embedding matrix, then CNN with subject sex integration estimates continuous brain age.

Result: Achieved MAE of 3.34 years (r=0.98, ρ=0.97, R²=0.95) across 11 MRI datasets (130+ sites), outperforming baselines. Generalizes well to 4 independent cohorts (MAE 3.77-5.04 years). Brain age gap associated with Alzheimer's, cognitive impairment, and autism.

Conclusion: BrainRotViT provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging CNN and transformer approaches while enabling new research avenues in aging and neurodegeneration.

Abstract: Accurate brain age estimation from structural MRI is a valuable biomarker for studying aging and neurodegeneration. Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $ρ=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.

TL;DR: Vision-Language Synergy improves abstract reasoning in ARC-AGI tasks by combining visual pattern abstraction with linguistic rule formulation, achieving 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models fail at inferring structured transformation rules from minimal examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. ARC-AGI provides a testbed for this capability, but existing methods overlook visual abstraction that humans use.

Method: Two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR) that decomposes tasks into modality-aligned subtasks, and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC) that uses vision to verify text-based reasoning for error correction.

Result: The approach yields up to 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks.

Conclusion: Unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is crucial for achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models.

Abstract: Abstract reasoning from minimal examples remains a core unsolved problem for frontier foundation models such as GPT-5 and Grok 4. These models still fail to infer structured transformation rules from a handful of examples, which is a key hallmark of human intelligence. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) provides a rigorous testbed for this capability, demanding conceptual rule induction and transfer to novel tasks. Most existing methods treat ARC-AGI as a purely textual reasoning task, overlooking the fact that humans rely heavily on visual abstraction when solving such puzzles. However, our pilot experiments reveal a paradox: naively rendering ARC-AGI grids as images degrades performance due to imprecise rule execution. This leads to our central hypothesis that vision and language possess complementary strengths across distinct reasoning stages: vision supports global pattern abstraction and verification, whereas language specializes in symbolic rule formulation and precise execution. Building on this insight, we introduce two synergistic strategies: (1) Vision-Language Synergy Reasoning (VLSR), which decomposes ARC-AGI into modality-aligned subtasks; and (2) Modality-Switch Self-Correction (MSSC), which leverages vision to verify text-based reasoning for intrinsic error correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach yields up to a 4.33% improvement over text-only baselines across diverse flagship models and multiple ARC-AGI tasks. Our findings suggest that unifying visual abstraction with linguistic reasoning is a crucial step toward achieving generalizable, human-like intelligence in future foundation models. Source code will be released soon.

TL;DR: Insert In Style is a zero-shot generative framework that enables high-fidelity insertion of real-world objects into stylized domains without requiring text prompts or per-subject finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reference-based object composition methods fail when inserting real-world objects into stylized domains, with existing solutions split between practical but low-fidelity 'blenders' and high-fidelity but impractical 'generators' requiring online finetuning.

Method: A unified framework with multi-stage training protocol that disentangles identity, style, and composition representations, combined with a specialized masked-attention architecture that enforces this disentanglement during generation to prevent concept interference.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on a new public benchmark for stylized composition, significantly outperforming existing methods on both identity and style metrics, with results strongly corroborated by user studies.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully bridges the gap between practical and high-fidelity object composition in stylized domains, offering the first truly zero-shot solution that requires no text prompts or per-subject finetuning.

Abstract: Reference-based object composition methods fail when inserting real-world objects into stylized domains. This under-explored problem is currently split between practical "blenders" that lack generative fidelity and "generators" that require impractical, per-subject online finetuning. In this work, we introduce Insert In Style, the first zero-shot generative framework that is both practical and high-fidelity. Our core contribution is a unified framework with two key innovations: (i) a novel multi-stage training protocol that disentangles representations for identity, style, and composition, and (ii) a specialized masked-attention architecture that surgically enforces this disentanglement during generation. This approach prevents the concept interference common in general-purpose, unified-attention models. Our framework is trained on a new 100k sample dataset, curated from a novel data pipeline. This pipeline couples large-scale generation with a rigorous, two-stage filtering process to ensure both high-fidelity semantic identity and style coherence. Unlike prior work, our model is truly zero-shot and requires no text prompts. We also introduce a new public benchmark for stylized composition. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods on both identity and style metrics, a result strongly corroborated by user studies.

*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a causal intervention approach to address bias in food-to-recipe cross-modal retrieval by treating ingredients as confounders and using backdoor adjustment to improve similarity judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat recipes as text describing dish appearance, creating bias because food images don't equally capture all recipe details due to cooking process, presentation, and image conditions. Current methods overlook subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance.

Method: Model bias using causal theory, identify ingredients as confounders, apply backdoor adjustment through causal intervention. Propose a plug-and-play neural module (multi-label ingredient classifier) for debiasing.

Result: Achieved oracle performance of MedR=1 across testing data sizes (1K, 10K, 50K) on Recipe1M dataset. Reported new state-of-the-art search performances.

Conclusion: Causal intervention effectively addresses bias in cross-modal recipe-food retrieval by removing confounding effects of ingredients, leading to significantly improved retrieval performance.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of learning representations for recipes and food images in the cross-modal retrieval problem. As the relationship between a recipe and its cooked dish is cause-and-effect, treating a recipe as a text source describing the visual appearance of a dish for learning representation, as the existing approaches, will create bias misleading image-and-recipe similarity judgment. Specifically, a food image may not equally capture every detail in a recipe, due to factors such as the cooking process, dish presentation, and image-capturing conditions. The current representation learning tends to capture dominant visual-text alignment while overlooking subtle variations that determine retrieval relevance. In this paper, we model such bias in cross-modal representation learning using causal theory. The causal view of this problem suggests ingredients as one of the confounder sources and a simple backdoor adjustment can alleviate the bias. By causal intervention, we reformulate the conventional model for food-to-recipe retrieval with an additional term to remove the potential bias in similarity judgment. Based on this theory-informed formulation, we empirically prove the oracle performance of retrieval on the Recipe1M dataset to be MedR=1 across the testing data sizes of 1K, 10K, and even 50K. We also propose a plug-and-play neural module, which is essentially a multi-label ingredient classifier for debiasing. New state-of-the-art search performances are reported on the Recipe1M dataset.

TL;DR: Proposes PCMDE, a physics-constrained multimodal evaluation metric that combines LLMs with reasoning, knowledge mapping, and VLMs to address limitations of current metrics like BLEU and CLIPScore in capturing semantic/structural accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics (BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, etc.) fail to adequately capture semantic or structural accuracy, particularly in domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios.

Method: Three-stage architecture: (1) multimodal feature extraction using object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive validation; (3) physics-guided reasoning with LLMs to enforce structural/relational constraints.

Result: PCMDE metric developed that overcomes limitations of existing metrics by incorporating physics constraints and multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: The proposed PCMDE framework provides a more comprehensive evaluation approach that captures semantic and structural accuracy through physics-constrained multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Current state of the art measures like BLEU, CIDEr, VQA score, SigLIP-2 and CLIPScore are often unable to capture semantic or structural accuracy, especially for domain-specific or context-dependent scenarios. For this, this paper proposes a Physics-Constrained Multimodal Data Evaluation (PCMDE) metric combining large language models with reasoning, knowledge based mapping and vision-language models to overcome these limitations. The architecture is comprised of three main stages: (1) feature extraction of spatial and semantic information with multimodal features through object detection and VLMs; (2) Confidence-Weighted Component Fusion for adaptive component-level validation; and (3) physics-guided reasoning using large language models for structural and relational constraints (e.g., alignment, position, consistency) enforcement.

Motivation: To create a dermatology AI system that makes diagnostic reasoning explicit, verifiable, and clinically aligned by developing standardized chain-of-thought narratives for skin disease diagnosis.

Method: Built DermCoT corpus with 13,000 dermatologic chain-of-thought cases, developed DermEval six-dimensional evaluator and DermBench benchmark, and trained SkinGPT-R1 using chain-of-thought supervision with dermatology-aware visual distillation.

Result: SkinGPT-R1 achieved average score of 4.031/5 on DermBench, ranked 1st among 14 models, improved by 41% over Vision-R1, and showed stable accuracy gains on three dermatology classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought supervision with dermatology-specific reasoning and visual distillation significantly improves diagnostic narrative quality and recognition performance in dermatology AI systems.

Abstract: We present SkinGPT-R1, a dermatology focused vision language model that makes diagnostic chain of thought reasoning explicit, step by step, and verifiable. To support skin specific reasoning, we build DermCoT, a corpus of standardized dermatologic chain of thought narratives that combines 10,000 DermEval filtered training cases with 3,000 dermatologist scored certified cases, and we define DermEval as a physician aligned six dimensional evaluator and DermBench as the corresponding benchmark for dermatologic chain of thought quality. On DermBench, across 14 general, reasoning, and medical vision language models, SkinGPT-R1 achieves an average score of 4.031 out of 5 over the six clinician defined dimensions, ranks 1st among all systems, and improves the average score over Vision-R1 by about 41%. On three dermatology classification benchmarks, SkinGPT-R1 delivers stable accuracy gains over Vision-R1 and remains competitive among strong vision language models. Ablation results further show that DermCoT based chain of thought supervision provides substantial improvements over the base model and that adding dermatology aware visual distillation yields consistent additional gains in both narrative quality and recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDXL-based methods struggle with high-quality results, and the recent Flux model fails to achieve effective content-style separation due to its underexplored characteristics, creating a need for better disentanglement approaches.

Method: SplitFlux uses two key components: (1) Rank-Constrained Adaptation that compresses rank and amplifies magnitude updates in specific blocks to prevent content leakage, and (2) Visual-Gated LoRA that splits content LoRA into high-rank (primary subject) and low-rank (residual details) branches guided by image saliency.

Result: Extensive experiments show SplitFlux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior content preservation and stylization quality across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: SplitFlux successfully addresses content-style disentanglement challenges in Flux models through systematic analysis and targeted adaptations, enabling effective re-embedding of disentangled content into new contexts.

Abstract: Disentangling image content and style is essential for customized image generation. Existing SDXL-based methods struggle to achieve high-quality results, while the recently proposed Flux model fails to achieve effective content-style separation due to its underexplored characteristics. To address these challenges, we conduct a systematic analysis of Flux and make two key observations: (1) Single Dream Blocks are essential for image generation; and (2) Early single stream blocks mainly control content, whereas later blocks govern style. Based on these insights, we propose SplitFlux, which disentangles content and style by fine-tuning the single dream blocks via LoRA, enabling the disentangled content to be re-embedded into new contexts. It includes two key components: (1) Rank-Constrained Adaptation. To preserve content identity and structure, we compress the rank and amplify the magnitude of updates within specific blocks, preventing content leakage into style blocks. (2) Visual-Gated LoRA. We split the content LoRA into two branches with different ranks, guided by image saliency. The high-rank branch preserves primary subject information, while the low-rank branch encodes residual details, mitigating content overfitting and enabling seamless re-embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitFlux consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior content preservation and stylization quality across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: GQN provides an effective graph-based framework for 3D radar object detection that handles sparse radar data better than traditional approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Object detection with 3D radar is essential for 360-degree automotive perception, but radar's long wavelengths produce sparse and irregular reflections that challenge traditional grid and sequence-based convolutional and transformer detectors. This paper introduces Graph Query Networks (GQN), an attention-based framework that models objects sensed by radar as graphs, to extract individualized relational and contextual features. GQN employs a novel concept of graph queries to dynamically attend over the bird's-eye view (BEV) space, constructing object-specific graphs processed by two novel modules: EdgeFocus for relational reasoning and DeepContext Pooling for contextual aggregation. On the NuScenes dataset, GQN improves relative mAP by up to +53%, including a +8.2% gain over the strongest prior radar method, while reducing peak graph construction overhead by 80% with moderate FLOPs cost.

TL;DR: LEO is a framework for 3D scene graph prediction that transforms relations into nodes in a line graph to capture high-order dependencies, improving relation prediction through edge-to-object reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing object-centric graph neural networks restrict relation representations to pairwise object context, making it difficult to capture essential high-order relational dependencies for accurate relation prediction.

Method: Proposes LEO framework that first predicts potential links between object pairs, transforms scene graph into line graph where relations become nodes, applies line graph neural network for edge-centric reasoning, then integrates enriched relation features back into object-centric graph.

Result: Experiments on 3DSSG dataset with two competitive baselines show consistent improvements in relation prediction performance.

Conclusion: The edge-to-object reasoning paradigm effectively captures inter-relation context and enhances relation prediction in 3D scene graphs.

Abstract: 3D scene graph prediction aims to abstract complex 3D environments into structured graphs consisting of objects and their pairwise relationships. Existing approaches typically adopt object-centric graph neural networks, where relation edge features are iteratively updated by aggregating messages from connected object nodes. However, this design inherently restricts relation representations to pairwise object context, making it difficult to capture high-order relational dependencies that are essential for accurate relation prediction. To address this limitation, we propose a Link-guided Edge-centric relational reasoning framework with Object-aware fusion, namely LEO, which enables progressive reasoning from relation-level context to object-level understanding. Specifically, LEO first predicts potential links between object pairs to suppress irrelevant edges, and then transforms the original scene graph into a line graph where each relation is treated as a node. A line graph neural network is applied to perform edge-centric relational reasoning to capture inter-relation context. The enriched relation features are subsequently integrated into the original object-centric graph to enhance object-level reasoning and improve relation prediction. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any existing object-centric method. Experiments on the 3DSSG dataset with two competitive baselines show consistent improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of our edge-to-object reasoning paradigm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training prohibited item detection models requires large X-ray security datasets, but collection and annotation are time-consuming. Previous two-stage synthesis methods require labor-intensive foreground extraction, introducing extra costs.

Method: Proposes a one-stage pipeline based on text-to-image generation with two strategies: Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) to refine bounding box annotations using diffusion model attention maps, and Background Occlusion Modeling (BOM) to explicitly model background occlusion in latent space.

Result: Outperforms all previous methods with 1.2% mAP improvement. Synthetic images improve prohibited item detection performance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.

Conclusion: Xsyn is the first method to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost, providing an efficient solution for data insufficiency in prohibited item detection.

Abstract: Training prohibited item detection models requires a large amount of X-ray security images, but collecting and annotating these images is time-consuming and laborious. To address data insufficiency, X-ray security image synthesis methods composite images to scale up datasets. However, previous methods primarily follow a two-stage pipeline, where they implement labor-intensive foreground extraction in the first stage and then composite images in the second stage. Such a pipeline introduces inevitable extra labor cost and is not efficient. In this paper, we propose a one-stage X-ray security image synthesis pipeline (Xsyn) based on text-to-image generation, which incorporates two effective strategies to improve the usability of synthetic images. The Cross-Attention Refinement (CAR) strategy leverages the cross-attention map from the diffusion model to refine the bounding box annotation. The Background Occlusion Modeling (BOM) strategy explicitly models background occlusion in the latent space to enhance imaging complexity. To the best of our knowledge, compared with previous methods, Xsyn is the first to achieve high-quality X-ray security image synthesis without extra labor cost. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all previous methods with 1.2% mAP improvement, and the synthetic images generated by our method are beneficial to improve prohibited item detection performance across various X-ray security datasets and detectors.

Method: Uses a coarse-to-fine pipeline: global place recognition with pretrained language model + Hierarchical Transformer with Max pooling for text, attention-based point cloud encoder, Masked Instance Training for robustness, and Modality-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Learning. Fine localization uses Prototype-based Map Cloning and Cascaded Cross-Attention Transformer without explicit text-instance matching.

Result: Outperforms existing methods by up to 15% on KITTI360Pose dataset, shows robust generalization on new dataset, effectively handles complex linguistic expressions and diverse urban environments.

Conclusion: Text2Loc++ provides an effective solution for 3D point cloud localization using natural language, with strong performance and generalization capabilities across complex urban scenes and linguistic expressions.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of localizing 3D point cloud submaps using complex and diverse natural language descriptions, and present Text2Loc++, a novel neural network designed for effective cross-modal alignment between language and point clouds in a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline. To support benchmarking, we introduce a new city-scale dataset covering both color and non-color point clouds from diverse urban scenes, and organize location descriptions into three levels of linguistic complexity. In the global place recognition stage, Text2Loc++ combines a pretrained language model with a Hierarchical Transformer with Max pooling (HTM) for sentence-level semantics, and employs an attention-based point cloud encoder for spatial understanding. We further propose Masked Instance Training (MIT) to filter out non-aligned objects and improve multimodal robustness. To enhance the embedding space, we introduce Modality-aware Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (MHCL), incorporating cross-modal, submap-, text-, and instance-level losses. In the fine localization stage, we completely remove explicit text-instance matching and design a lightweight yet powerful framework based on Prototype-based Map Cloning (PMC) and a Cascaded Cross-Attention Transformer (CCAT). Extensive experiments on the KITTI360Pose dataset show that Text2Loc++ outperforms existing methods by up to 15%. In addition, the proposed model exhibits robust generalization when evaluated on the new dataset, effectively handling complex linguistic expressions and a wide variety of urban environments. The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: Uni-Adapter is a training-free online test-time adaptation method for 3D vision-language foundation models that uses dynamic prototype learning to handle noisy, incomplete, or distribution-shifted data without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D vision-language foundation models underperform in practical scenarios with noisy, incomplete, or distribution-shifted data, requiring adaptation methods that work without retraining.

Method: Uses dynamic prototype learning with a 3D cache storing class-specific cluster centers, graph-based label smoothing for inter-prototype consistency, and entropy-weighted aggregation to unify predictions from original VLFM and refined cache.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance: improves ModelNet-40C by 10.55%, ScanObjectNN-C by 8.26%, and ShapeNet-C by 4.49% over source 3D VLFMs.

Conclusion: Uni-Adapter effectively mitigates distribution shifts in 3D vision-language foundation models through training-free online adaptation, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse 3D benchmarks.

Abstract: 3D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs) have shown strong generalization and zero-shot recognition capabilities in open-world point cloud processing tasks. However, these models often underperform in practical scenarios where data are noisy, incomplete, or drawn from a different distribution than the training data. To address this, we propose Uni-Adapter, a novel training-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy for 3D VLFMs based on dynamic prototype learning. We define a 3D cache to store class-specific cluster centers as prototypes, which are continuously updated to capture intra-class variability in heterogeneous data distributions. These dynamic prototypes serve as anchors for cache-based logit computation via similarity scoring. Simultaneously, a graph-based label smoothing module captures inter-prototype similarities to enforce label consistency among similar prototypes. Finally, we unify predictions from the original 3D VLFM and the refined 3D cache using entropy-weighted aggregation for reliable adaptation. Without retraining, Uni-Adapter effectively mitigates distribution shifts, achieving state-of-the-art performance on diverse 3D benchmarks over different 3D VLFMs, improving ModelNet-40C by 10.55%, ScanObjectNN-C by 8.26%, and ShapeNet-C by 4.49% over the source 3D VLFMs.

TL;DR: FIA-Flow is a black-box feature inversion attack framework that achieves high-fidelity image reconstruction from intermediate features in Split DNNs, revealing more severe privacy risks than previously recognized.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split DNNs expose privacy vulnerabilities as intermediate features can be exploited to reconstruct private inputs via Feature Inversion Attack (FIA), but existing methods have limited reconstruction quality, making it difficult to assess the true extent of privacy leakage.

Method: Uses Latent Feature Space Alignment Module (LFSAM) to bridge semantic gap between intermediate features and latent space, and Deterministic Inversion Flow Matching (DIFM) to project off-manifold features onto target manifold with one-step inference. Also proposes two metrics based on vision-language model to quantify privacy leakage.

Result: Achieves more faithful and semantically aligned feature inversion across various models (AlexNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, DINO, YOLO11) and layers, enabling effective training with few image-feature pairs.

Conclusion: FIA-Flow reveals a more severe privacy threat in Split DNNs than previously recognized, demonstrating that intermediate features can be effectively exploited to reconstruct private inputs with high fidelity.

Abstract: Split DNNs enable edge devices by offloading intensive computation to a cloud server, but this paradigm exposes privacy vulnerabilities, as the intermediate features can be exploited to reconstruct the private inputs via Feature Inversion Attack (FIA). Existing FIA methods often produce limited reconstruction quality, making it difficult to assess the true extent of privacy leakage. To reveal the privacy risk of the leaked features, we introduce FIA-Flow, a black-box FIA framework that achieves high-fidelity image reconstruction from intermediate features. To exploit the semantic information within intermediate features, we design a Latent Feature Space Alignment Module (LFSAM) to bridge the semantic gap between the intermediate feature space and the latent space. Furthermore, to rectify distributional mismatch, we develop Deterministic Inversion Flow Matching (DIFM), which projects off-manifold features onto the target manifold with one-step inference. This decoupled design simplifies learning and enables effective training with few image-feature pairs. To quantify privacy leakage from a human perspective, we also propose two metrics based on a large vision-language model. Experiments show that FIA-Flow achieves more faithful and semantically aligned feature inversion across various models (AlexNet, ResNet, Swin Transformer, DINO, and YOLO11) and layers, revealing a more severe privacy threat in Split DNNs than previously recognized.

*Zahra Farzadpour,Masoumeh Azghani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fingerprint liveness detection algorithm using adaptive thresholding and wavelet transform with SVM classification, showing improved resistance to distortions like noise and missing pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address spoofing threats in fingerprint biometric systems by developing robust techniques that can distinguish fake fingerprints from real ones and resist various distortions.

Method: Uses anisotropic diffusion, three-level wavelet transform with adaptive thresholding of coefficients, concatenates features into vectors, and classifies with SVM. Also investigates effects of pixel/block missing and noise contamination.

Result: Outperforms counterparts by ~8% accuracy for 90% missing pixels and ~5% for 70x70 block missing scenarios, demonstrating improved resistance to distortions.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive thresholding pattern with wavelet transform and SVM classification provides an effective and robust solution for fingerprint forgery detection, particularly resilient against various distortion attacks.

Abstract: Fingerprint liveness detection systems have been affected by spoofing, which is a severe threat for fingerprint-based biometric systems. Therefore, it is crucial to develop some techniques to distinguish the fake fingerprints from the real ones. The software based techniques can detect the fingerprint forgery automatically. Also, the scheme shall be resistant against various distortions such as noise contamination, pixel missing and block missing, so that the forgers cannot deceive the detector by adding some distortions to the faked fingerprint. In this paper, we propose a fingerprint forgery detection algorithm based on a suggested adaptive thresholding pattern. The anisotropic diffusion of the input image is passed through three levels of the wavelet transform. The coefficients of different layers are adaptively thresholded and concatenated to produce the feature vector which is classified using the SVM classifier. Another contribution of the paper is to investigate the effect of various distortions such as pixel missing, block missing, and noise contamination. Our suggested approach includes a novel method that exhibits improved resistance against a range of distortions caused by environmental phenomena or manipulations by malicious users. In quantitative comparisons, our proposed method outperforms its counterparts by approximately 8% and 5% in accuracy for missing pixel scenarios of 90% and block missing scenarios of size 70x70 , respectively. This highlights the novelty approach in addressing such challenges.

*Spyridon Loukovitis,Vasileios Karampinis,Athanasios Voulodimos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight post-processing framework for UAV navigation that enables real-time three-way classification (in-domain targets, out-of-distribution objects, background) using MLP-based fusion of multiple confidence estimates, outperforming threshold-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing UAV object detectors handle closed-set detection well but struggle with open-set scenarios where both known and unknown objects appear. Current open-set approaches use single uncertainty scores with thresholding, which lacks flexibility and often confuses OOD objects with background clutter.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic post-processing framework using a compact MLP that fuses multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features. Incorporates different logit variants to enhance performance without compromising throughput.

Result: Surpasses threshold-based baselines by average 2.7% AUROC in binary classification, retains or improves open-set mAP, and enables robust three-class classification. Improves closed-set mAP by up to 9 points (18% relative gain) while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The framework provides critical capability for safe UAV navigation by actively distinguishing OOD objects from background, enabling avoidance of unknown objects while safely ignoring background regions.

Abstract: Developing reliable UAV navigation systems requires robust air-to-air object detectors capable of distinguishing between objects seen during training and previously unseen objects. While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP. Furthermore, our study uniquely enables robust three-class classification, a critical capability for safe UAV navigation, where OOD objects must be actively avoided and background regions safely ignored. Comparative analysis highlights that our method surpasses competitive techniques in AUROC across datasets, while improving closed-set mAP by up to 9 points, an 18% relative gain.

TL;DR: IPTQ-ViT is a novel post-training quantization framework for vision transformers that enables fully integer-only inference without retraining, using optimized approximation functions for GELU and Softmax layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT methods require expensive retraining for non-linear layer quantization, while PTQ methods either partially quantize non-linear functions or fail to achieve fully integer-only inference, limiting deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Proposes polynomial-based GELU approximation optimized for vision data and bit-shifting-based Softmax approximation. Uses a unified metric considering quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select optimal approximation functions per activation layer.

Result: Outperforms previous PTQ methods with up to 6.44%p (avg. 1.78%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification and 1.0 mAP for object detection. Matches integer-only QAT methods in accuracy and latency under W8A8 and W4A8 configurations.

Conclusion: IPTQ-ViT enables efficient fully integer-only inference for vision transformers without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art performance and making transformer deployment practical in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Previous Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods for vision transformers rely on expensive retraining to recover accuracy loss in non-linear layer quantization, limiting their use in resource-constrained environments. In contrast, existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods either partially quantize non-linear functions or adjust activation distributions to maintain accuracy but fail to achieve fully integer-only inference. In this paper, we introduce IPTQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for fully integer-only vision transformers without retraining. We present approximation functions: a polynomial-based GELU optimized for vision data and a bit-shifting-based Softmax designed to improve approximation accuracy in PTQ. In addition, we propose a unified metric integrating quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select the optimal approximation function per activation layer. IPTQ-ViT outperforms previous PTQ methods, achieving up to 6.44\%p (avg. 1.78\%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification, 1.0 mAP for object detection. IPTQ-ViT outperforms partial floating-point PTQ methods under W8A8 and W4A8, and achieves accuracy and latency comparable to integer-only QAT methods.

TL;DR: ZOMG is a zero-shot, open-vocabulary framework that segments motion sequences into semantic sub-actions without annotations or fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on motion grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods require dense supervision with predefined action classes, which is infeasible for real-world open-vocabulary settings. There's a need for annotation-free motion understanding that can decompose complex activities into fine-grained sub-actions.

Method: ZOMG integrates language semantic partition using LLMs to decompose instructions into ordered sub-action units, and soft masking optimization that learns instance-specific temporal masks to focus on critical frames while maintaining segment continuity and separation.

Result: Experiments on three motion-language datasets show ZOMG outperforms prior methods by +8.7% mAP on HumanML3D benchmark, with significant improvements in downstream retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: ZOMG establishes a new paradigm for annotation-free motion understanding, demonstrating state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency in motion grounding without requiring any annotations or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Understanding complex human activities demands the ability to decompose motion into fine-grained, semantic-aligned sub-actions. This motion grounding process is crucial for behavior analysis, embodied AI and virtual reality. Yet, most existing methods rely on dense supervision with predefined action classes, which are infeasible in open-vocabulary, real-world settings. In this paper, we propose ZOMG, a zero-shot, open-vocabulary framework that segments motion sequences into semantically meaningful sub-actions without requiring any annotations or fine-tuning. Technically, ZOMG integrates (1) language semantic partition, which leverages large language models to decompose instructions into ordered sub-action units, and (2) soft masking optimization, which learns instance-specific temporal masks to focus on frames critical to sub-actions, while maintaining intra-segment continuity and enforcing inter-segment separation, all without altering the pretrained encoder. Experiments on three motion-language datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness and efficiency of motion grounding performance, outperforming prior methods by +8.7\% mAP on HumanML3D benchmark. Meanwhile, significant improvements also exist in downstream retrieval, establishing a new paradigm for annotation-free motion understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoPrune enables LLMs to automatically design their own pruning algorithms using a Graph-driven Chain-of-Thought approach, eliminating the need for expert knowledge and addressing outlier value issues with adaptive sparsity allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM pruning methods require manual algorithm design with expert knowledge, causing high labor costs. Additionally, uniform sparsity causes performance degradation due to outlier values at high pruning ratios.

Method: AutoPrune uses Graph-driven Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to optimize prompts for LLMs to design pruning algorithms automatically. It also introduces Skew-aware Dynamic Sparsity Allocation (SDSA) to handle outlier value issues.

Result: Extensive experiments on mainstream LLM benchmarks show AutoPrune consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods, achieving superior performance even under high pruning ratios.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively prune themselves without expert intervention, and AutoPrune provides an automated, interpretable solution that overcomes key limitations of existing pruning approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks, hindering real-world deployment due to their massive size. Existing pruning methods (e.g., Wanda) tailored for LLMs rely heavily on manual design pruning algorithms, thereby leading to \textit{huge labor costs} and \textit{requires expert knowledge}. Furthermore, we are the first to identify the serious \textit{outlier value issue} behind dramatic performance degradation under high pruning ratios that are caused by uniform sparsity, raising an additional concern about how to design adaptive pruning sparsity ideal for LLMs. Can LLMs prune by themselves? In this work, we introduce an affirmative answer by proposing a novel pruning method called \textbf{AutoPrune}, which first overcomes expert knowledge limits by leveraging LLMs to design optimal pruning algorithms for themselves automatically without any expert knowledge. Specifically, to mitigate the black-box nature of LLMs, we propose a Graph-driven Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to optimize prompts, significantly enhancing the reasoning process in learning the pruning algorithm and enabling us to generate pruning algorithms with superior performance and interpretability in the next generation. Finally, grounded in insights of outlier value issue, we introduce Skew-aware Dynamic Sparsity Allocation (SDSA) to overcome the outlier value issue, mitigating performance degradation under high pruning ratios. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs benchmarks, demonstrating the superiority of AutoPrune, which consistently excels state-of-the-art competitors.

TL;DR: ShelfOcc introduces a vision-only method for 3D occupancy estimation that generates metrically consistent semantic voxel labels from video, overcoming limitations of 2D projection-based supervision without relying on LiDAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address geometric inconsistencies and depth bleeding in existing self- and weakly supervised occupancy estimation methods that rely on 2D projection or rendering-based supervision, without requiring LiDAR sensors or manual 3D annotations.

Method: Uses a dedicated framework that filters and accumulates static geometry consistently across frames, handles dynamic content, and propagates semantic information into stable voxel representations by leveraging vision-based 3D geometry foundation models.

Result: Substantially outperforms all previous weakly/shelf-supervised methods on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark with up to 34% relative improvement, establishing new state-of-the-art for LiDAR-free 3D scene understanding.

Conclusion: High-quality 3D supervision is essential for robust occupancy learning and represents an important complementary approach to architectural innovation, enabling the use of any SOTA occupancy model architecture without LiDAR data.

Abstract: Recent progress in self- and weakly supervised occupancy estimation has largely relied on 2D projection or rendering-based supervision, which suffers from geometric inconsistencies and severe depth bleeding. We thus introduce ShelfOcc, a vision-only method that overcomes these limitations without relying on LiDAR. ShelfOcc brings supervision into native 3D space by generating metrically consistent semantic voxel labels from video, enabling true 3D supervision without any additional sensors or manual 3D annotations. While recent vision-based 3D geometry foundation models provide a promising source of prior knowledge, they do not work out of the box as a prediction due to sparse or noisy and inconsistent geometry, especially in dynamic driving scenes. Our method introduces a dedicated framework that mitigates these issues by filtering and accumulating static geometry consistently across frames, handling dynamic content and propagating semantic information into a stable voxel representation. This data-centric shift in supervision for weakly/shelf-supervised occupancy estimation allows the use of essentially any SOTA occupancy model architecture without relying on LiDAR data. We argue that such high-quality supervision is essential for robust occupancy learning and constitutes an important complementary avenue to architectural innovation. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, ShelfOcc substantially outperforms all previous weakly/shelf-supervised methods (up to a 34% relative improvement), establishing a new data-driven direction for LiDAR-free 3D scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A post-hoc framework for semantic segmentation that creates confidence masks with statistical guarantees on false-positive control using conformal prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep segmentation models lack explicit statistical guarantees on errors, which is critical for clinical decision making where over-segmentation can have serious consequences.

Method: Uses a nested family of shrunken masks (via score thresholding or morphological erosion) and selects shrink parameters via conformal prediction on a calibration set to control false positives.

Result: The method achieves target-level empirical validity on polyp-segmentation benchmarks and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor.

Conclusion: Enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in clinical settings with statistical guarantees on false-positive control, requiring no model retraining.

Abstract: Reliable semantic segmentation is essential for clinical decision making, yet deep models rarely provide explicit statistical guarantees on their errors. We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences. Code at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/conseco.

*Wenlun Zhang,Yunshan Zhong,Zihao Ding,Xinyu Li,Kentaro Yoshioka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D4C is a data-free quantization framework for CLIP models that addresses performance degradation by synthesizing semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through prompt-guided semantic injection, structural contrastive generation, and perturbation-aware enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) is practical for privacy-sensitive scenarios but existing DFQ techniques cause substantial performance degradation when applied to Vision-Language Models like CLIP due to insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples.

Method: D4C synthesizes pseudo images using three components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection for real-world semantic alignment, (2) Structural Contrastive Generation for natural image composition using foreground-background contrast, and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement for diversity and robustness.

Result: D4C achieves significant performance improvements: under W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, Top-1 accuracy improvements of 12.4%/18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8%/19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4%/5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification.

Conclusion: D4C effectively bridges the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP by synthesizing semantically informative and structurally diverse images, making it the first successful DFQ framework tailored for Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) offers a practical solution for model compression without requiring access to real data, making it particularly attractive in privacy-sensitive scenarios. While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.

We further analyse the impact of training data environments and propose a first step towards effective navigability in challenging environments with the constraint of having no annotation of the targeted images. Our goal is to foster impactful research that enhances the robustness and safety of autonomous vehicles in high-risk scenarios while being frugal in annotated data.

Motivation: Most multimodal detection studies focus on fusion strategies but neglect fusion degradation and lack theoretical analysis of its causes, leaving a research gap.

Method: Proposes Representation Space Constrained Learning with Modality Decoupling (RSC-MD) method with two modules: RSC module to amplify suppressed gradients and MD module to eliminate inter-modality coupling and imbalance.

Result: Extensive experiments on FLIR, LLVIP, M3FD, and MFAD datasets show the method effectively alleviates fusion degradation and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed RSC-MD method successfully addresses fusion degradation by resolving gradient suppression and modality imbalance, enabling comprehensive optimization of each modality-specific backbone.

Abstract: Multimodal object detection has attracted significant attention in both academia and industry for its enhanced robustness. Although numerous studies have focused on improving modality fusion strategies, most neglect fusion degradation, and none provide a theoretical analysis of its underlying causes. To fill this gap, this paper presents a systematic theoretical investigation of fusion degradation in multimodal detection and identifies two key optimization deficiencies: (1) the gradients of unimodal branch backbones are severely suppressed under multimodal architectures, resulting in under-optimization of the unimodal branches; (2) disparities in modality quality cause weaker modalities to experience stronger gradient suppression, which in turn results in imbalanced modality learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Representation Space Constrained Learning with Modality Decoupling (RSC-MD) method, which consists of two modules. The RSC module and the MD module are designed to respectively amplify the suppressed gradients and eliminate inter-modality coupling interference as well as modality imbalance, thereby enabling the comprehensive optimization of each modality-specific backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on the FLIR, LLVIP, M3FD, and MFAD datasets demonstrate that the proposed method effectively alleviates fusion degradation and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. The code and training procedures will be released at https://github.com/yikangshao/RSC-MD.

### [100] [HV-Attack: Hierarchical Visual Attack for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15435)
*Linyin Luo,Yujuan Ding,Yunshan Ma,Wenqi Fan,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical visual attack method that disrupts MRAG systems by adding imperceptible perturbations to image inputs, causing misalignment between multimodal queries and retrieved knowledge to confuse generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research shows MRAG systems are vulnerable to knowledge poisoning attacks, but this work explores a different attack setting using only visual perturbations on user image inputs without manipulating other components.

Method: Hierarchical visual attack with two-stage strategy: first disrupts cross-modal alignment, then disrupts multimodal semantic alignment to make retriever recall irrelevant knowledge, misaligning the generator's two inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on OK-VQA and InfoSeek datasets using CLIP-based retrievers and BLIP-2/LLaVA generators show significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.

Conclusion: The proposed visual attack effectively compromises MRAG systems by exploiting vulnerabilities through imperceptible image perturbations, demonstrating the security risks in multimodal RAG frameworks.

Abstract: Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel dataset for gearbox component inspection with distribution shifts to benchmark model generalization, plus a contrastive regularization loss that improves performance on unseen components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating visual inspection in remanufacturing is challenging due to high part variety and defect patterns, and deep learning models struggle to generalize to new product variants.

Method: Created a dataset of gearbox components in good/defective condition from two transmissions, designed train-test splits to create distribution shifts, and proposed a contrastive regularization loss for better generalization.

Result: The contrastive regularization loss demonstrated improved generalization ability to unseen types of components compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and contrastive regularization approach effectively address generalization challenges in automated visual inspection for remanufacturing applications.

Abstract: Remanufacturing describes a process where worn products are restored to like-new condition and it offers vast ecological and economic potentials. A key step is the quality inspection of disassembled components, which is mostly done manually due to the high variety of parts and defect patterns. Deep neural networks show great potential to automate such visual inspection tasks but struggle to generalize to new product variants, components, or defect patterns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel image dataset depicting typical gearbox components in good and defective condition from two automotive transmissions. Depending on the train-test split of the data, different distribution shifts are generated to benchmark the generalization ability of a classification model. We evaluate different models using the dataset and propose a contrastive regularization loss to enhance model robustness. The results obtained demonstrate the ability of the loss to improve generalisation to unseen types of components.

Conclusion: EASD provides an effective solution for end-to-end spike stream detection in autonomous driving by leveraging spike cameras' advantages while overcoming their sparse, discrete output limitations.

Abstract: Object detection in autonomous driving suffers from motion blur and saturation under fast motion and extreme lighting. Spike cameras, offer microsecond latency and ultra high dynamic range for object detection by using per pixel asynchronous integrate and fire. However, their sparse, discrete output cannot be processed by standard image-based detectors, posing a critical challenge for end to end spike stream detection. We propose EASD, an end to end spike camera detector with a dual branch design: a Temporal Based Texture plus Feature Fusion branch for global cross slice semantics, and an Entropy Selective Attention branch for object centric details.

TL;DR: Sigmma is a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework that learns hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales, improving gene-expression prediction and cross-modal retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches align HE tiles with ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization, which limits the ability to capture comprehensive tissue microenvironment information.

Method: Proposes multi-scale contrastive alignment to ensure coherent representations across modalities at different scales, and represents cell interactions as a graph integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships to capture cell-cell interactions from fine to coarse levels.

Result: Sigmma improves gene-expression prediction by avg. 9.78% and cross-modal retrieval by avg. 26.93% across datasets, and learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.

Conclusion: The multi-scale hierarchical approach effectively captures cross-modal correspondences and cell interactions, providing better representations for computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in computational pathology have leveraged vision-language models to learn joint representations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) images with spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles. However, existing approaches typically align HE tiles with their corresponding ST profiles at a single scale, overlooking fine-grained cellular structures and their spatial organization. To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets. We further show that it learns meaningful multi-tissue organization in downstream analyses.

TL;DR: AI pipeline for tuna species identification using electronic monitoring video data, achieving 84.8% segmentation/classification with 4.5% error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purse seiners catch 69% of world's tropical tuna, requiring electronic monitoring that generates massive video data. AI can reduce human workload and improve accuracy, but species identification remains challenging due to difficulty distinguishing bigeye from yellowfin tuna.

Method: Multi-stage pipeline: 1) Three segmentation approaches compared (Mask R-CNN, DINOv2+SAM2, YOLOv9+SAM2), 2) ByteTrack for individual tracking, 3) Standard vs hierarchical classification models evaluated, 4) Cross-validation and testing on known catch composition operations.

Result: YOLOv9-SAM2 performed best with validation mAP of 0.66±0.03 and recall 0.88±0.03. Hierarchical classification showed superior generalization. Combined approach achieved 84.8% segmentation/classification with 4.5% mean average error.

Conclusion: The proposed AI pipeline successfully addresses tuna species identification challenges in electronic monitoring systems, providing accurate catch composition estimates with significant workload reduction potential.

Abstract: Purse seiners play a crucial role in tuna fishing, as approximately 69% of the world's tropical tuna is caught using this gear. All tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations have established minimum standards to use electronic monitoring (EM) in fisheries in addition to traditional observers. The EM systems produce a massive amount of video data that human analysts must process. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflow can decrease that workload and improve the accuracy of the reports. However, species identification still poses significant challenges for AI, as achieving balanced performance across all species requires appropriate training data. Here, we quantify the difficulty experts face to distinguish bigeye tuna (BET, Thunnus Obesus) from yellowfin tuna (YFT, Thunnus Albacares) using images captured by EM systems. We found inter-expert agreements of 42.9% $\pm$ 35.6% for BET and 57.1% $\pm$ 35.6% for YFT. We then present a multi-stage pipeline to estimate the species composition of the catches using a reliable ground-truth dataset based on identifications made by observers on board. Three segmentation approaches are compared: Mask R-CNN, a combination of DINOv2 with SAM2, and a integration of YOLOv9 with SAM2. We found that the latest performs the best, with a validation mean average precision of 0.66 $\pm$ 0.03 and a recall of 0.88 $\pm$ 0.03. Segmented individuals are tracked using ByteTrack. For classification, we evaluate a standard multiclass classification model and a hierarchical approach, finding a superior generalization by the hierarchical. All our models were cross-validated during training and tested on fishing operations with fully known catch composition. Combining YOLOv9-SAM2 with the hierarchical classification produced the best estimations, with 84.8% of the individuals being segmented and classified with a mean average error of 4.5%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RS-CA-HSICT, a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture for enhanced MPox detection that integrates residual learning, spatial attention, and channel augmentation to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage the complementary strengths of CNNs and Transformers for improved MPox detection by capturing both local texture details and global contextual dependencies, addressing limitations of existing methods.

Method: Hybrid architecture with HSICT block (CNN-Transformer integration), residual CNN module, spatial CNN block, and channel augmentation. Uses multi-head attention, structural operations, inverse residual learning, and spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieved 98.30% classification accuracy and 98.13% F1-score on Kaggle benchmark and diverse MPox dataset, outperforming existing CNNs and Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: The RS-CA-HSICT framework effectively combines CNN and Transformer advantages for superior MPox detection, demonstrating enhanced feature learning and robust performance across datasets.

Abstract: This work proposes a hybrid deep learning approach, namely Residual and Spatial Learning based Channel Augmented Integrated CNN-Transformer architecture, that leverages the strengths of CNN and Transformer towards enhanced MPox detection. The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox. Experimental results on both the Kaggle benchmark and a diverse MPox dataset reported classification accuracy as high as 98.30% and an F1-score of 98.13%, which outperforms the existing CNNs and ViTs.

Abstract: Densely annotated medical image datasets that capture not only diagnostic labels but also the underlying reasoning behind these diagnoses are scarce. Such reasoning-related annotations are essential for developing and evaluating explainable AI (xAI) models that reason similarly to radiologists: making correct predictions for the right reasons. To address this gap, we introduce FunnyNodules, a fully parameterized synthetic dataset designed for systematic analysis of attribute-based reasoning in medical AI models. The dataset generates abstract, lung nodule-like shapes with controllable visual attributes such as roundness, margin sharpness, and spiculation. Target class is derived from a predefined attribute combination, allowing full control over the decision rule that links attributes to the diagnostic class. We demonstrate how FunnyNodules can be used in model-agnostic evaluations to assess whether models learn correct attribute-target relations, to interpret over- or underperformance in attribute prediction, and to analyze attention alignment with attribute-specific regions of interest. The framework is fully customizable, supporting variations in dataset complexity, target definitions, class balance, and beyond.

TL;DR: The paper introduces the MILL dataset for evaluating low-light image enhancement methods across diverse illumination conditions, revealing performance variations and proposing improvements that achieve significant PSNR gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current low-light enhancement methods rely on paired data from single illumination conditions, limiting understanding of performance across varying light intensities.

Method: Created the Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL) dataset with images captured at diverse light intensities under controlled conditions, then benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and proposed improvements leveraging the dataset's multi-illumination structure.

Result: Revealed significant performance variations across intensity levels and achieved up to 10 dB PSNR improvement for DSLR and 2 dB for smartphone on Full HD images.

Conclusion: The MILL dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of enhancement algorithms across variable lighting conditions, and the proposed modifications enhance robustness across diverse illumination scenarios.

Abstract: Imaging in low-light environments is challenging due to reduced scene radiance, which leads to elevated sensor noise and reduced color saturation. Most learning-based low-light enhancement methods rely on paired training data captured under a single low-light condition and a well-lit reference. The lack of radiance diversity limits our understanding of how enhancement techniques perform across varying illumination intensities. We introduce the Multi-Illumination Low-Light (MILL) dataset, containing images captured at diverse light intensities under controlled conditions with fixed camera settings and precise illuminance measurements. MILL enables comprehensive evaluation of enhancement algorithms across variable lighting conditions. We benchmark several state-of-the-art methods and reveal significant performance variations across intensity levels. Leveraging the unique multi-illumination structure of our dataset, we propose improvements that enhance robustness across diverse illumination scenarios. Our modifications achieve up to 10 dB PSNR improvement for DSLR and 2 dB for the smartphone on Full HD images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autoregressive visual generation methods suffer from inefficiency due to token-by-token decoding or complex multi-scale representations.

Method: Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR) unfolds image tokens in spiral order from center outward, with length-adaptive decoding that dynamically adjusts tokens per step.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet show EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency for single-scale autoregressive models.

Conclusion: EAR sets a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation by emulating human visual perception patterns.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have recently shown great promise in visual generation by leveraging discrete token sequences akin to language modeling. However, existing approaches often suffer from inefficiency, either due to token-by-token decoding or the complexity of multi-scale representations. In this work, we introduce Expanding Autoregressive Representation (EAR), a novel generation paradigm that emulates the human visual system's center-outward perception pattern. EAR unfolds image tokens in a spiral order from the center and progressively expands outward, preserving spatial continuity and enabling efficient parallel decoding. To further enhance flexibility and speed, we propose a length-adaptive decoding strategy that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens predicted at each step. This biologically inspired design not only reduces computational cost but also improves generation quality by aligning the generation order with perceptual relevance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that EAR achieves state-of-the-art trade-offs between fidelity and efficiency on single-scale autoregressive models, setting a new direction for scalable and cognitively aligned autoregressive image generation.

TL;DR: MTGNet is a dual-branch framework for few-shot semantic segmentation that enhances performance by fusing diverse textual prompts to refine textual priors and guide cross-modal optimization of visual priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based few-shot segmentation methods use single prompts that result in incomplete target region activation, lack explicit cross-modal interaction, and are vulnerable to noisy support features.

Method: Proposes three modules: Multi-Textual Prior Refinement (MTPR) for suppressing interference and aggregating semantic cues, Text Anchor Feature Fusion (TAFF) for transferring local prototypes using multi-text embeddings, and Foreground Confidence-Weighted Attention (FCWA) for enhancing visual prior robustness.

Result: Achieves 76.8% mIoU on PASCAL-5i and 57.4% on COCO-20i in 1-shot setting, with notable improvements in folds with high intra-class variations.

Conclusion: MTGNet effectively addresses limitations of single-prompt approaches by leveraging multiple textual prompts and cross-modal optimization, demonstrating superior performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent CLIP-based few-shot semantic segmentation methods introduce class-level textual priors to assist segmentation by typically using a single prompt (e.g., a photo of class). However, these approaches often result in incomplete activation of target regions, as a single textual description cannot fully capture the semantic diversity of complex categories. Moreover, they lack explicit cross-modal interaction and are vulnerable to noisy support features, further degrading visual prior quality. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Text Guided Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation Network (MTGNet), a dual-branch framework that enhances segmentation performance by fusing diverse textual prompts to refine textual priors and guide the cross-modal optimization of visual priors. Specifically, we design a Multi-Textual Prior Refinement (MTPR) module that suppresses interference and aggregates complementary semantic cues to enhance foreground activation and expand semantic coverage for structurally complex objects. We introduce a Text Anchor Feature Fusion (TAFF) module, which leverages multi-text embeddings as semantic anchors to facilitate the transfer of discriminative local prototypes from support images to query images, thereby improving semantic consistency and alleviating intra-class variations. Furthermore, a Foreground Confidence-Weighted Attention (FCWA) module is presented to enhance visual prior robustness by leveraging internal self-similarity within support foreground features. It adaptively down-weights inconsistent regions and effectively suppresses interference in the query segmentation process. Extensive experiments on standard FSS benchmarks validate the effectiveness of MTGNet. In the 1-shot setting, it achieves 76.8% mIoU on PASCAL-5i and 57.4% on COCO-20i, with notable improvements in folds exhibiting high intra-class variations.

Motivation: Human pose forecasting has important applications in action recognition, autonomous driving, and human-robot interaction. The paper aims to address reproducibility issues in existing methods and improve performance by drawing inspiration from speech understanding models.

Method: The authors evaluate various pose forecasting algorithms, provide a unified training and evaluation pipeline, adapt recent speech models to pose forecasting, and test robustness using noisy joint coordinates from pose estimator models. They introduce a new dataset variation and use unsupervised finetuning to recover performance degradation.

Result: Speech models adapted to pose forecasting improve state-of-the-art performance. However, estimated poses from pose estimators cause substantial performance degradation, though some of this can be recovered through unsupervised finetuning.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that speech models can be effectively adapted for pose forecasting, achieving better performance. It highlights the importance of considering realistic noise in pose data and shows that unsupervised finetuning can partially mitigate performance degradation from noisy pose estimates.

Abstract: Human pose forecasting predicts future poses based on past observations, and has many significant applications in areas such as action recognition, autonomous driving or human-robot interaction. This paper evaluates a wide range of pose forecasting algorithms in the task of absolute pose forecasting, revealing many reproducibility issues, and provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline. After drawing a high-level analogy to the task of speech understanding, it is shown that recent speech models can be efficiently adapted to the task of pose forecasting, and improve current state-of-the-art performance. At last the robustness of the models is evaluated, using noisy joint coordinates obtained from a pose estimator model, to reflect a realistic type of noise, which is more close to real-world applications. For this a new dataset variation is introduced, and it is shown that estimated poses result in a substantial performance degradation, and how much of it can be recovered again by unsupervised finetuning.

Motivation: To evaluate the security of AI-generated image detectors by developing advanced adversarial attacks that can invalidate them, addressing a gap in antiforensics research.

Method: Uses spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation to capture forensically important features, then fuses spatial and frequency-domain feature importances to guide adversarial example generation.

Result: Extensive experiments show DuFIA achieves strong cross-model transferability, maintains transparency, and demonstrates robustness across various AIGI detectors.

Conclusion: DuFIA successfully invalidates AIGI detectors through dual-domain feature importance modeling, highlighting security vulnerabilities in current detection systems.

Abstract: Recent AI-generated image (AIGI) detectors achieve impressive accuracy under clean condition. In view of antiforensics, it is significant to develop advanced adversarial attacks for evaluating the security of such detectors, which remains unexplored sufficiently. This letter proposes a Dual-domain Feature Importance Attack (DuFIA) scheme to invalidate AIGI detectors to some extent. Forensically important features are captured by the spatially interpolated gradient and frequency-aware perturbation. The adversarial transferability is enhanced by jointly modeling spatial and frequency-domain feature importances, which are fused to guide the optimization-based adversarial example generation. Extensive experiments across various AIGI detectors verify the cross-model transferability, transparency and robustness of DuFIA.

*Huiyuan Tian,Bonan Xu,Shijian Li,Xin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Feature-map KD fails for ViTs despite their low-rank representations. Analysis reveals token-level high-bandwidth encoding causes mismatch. Two strategies (feature lifting or width alignment) successfully reactivate ViT distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why feature-map knowledge distillation works well for CNNs but fails for Vision Transformers, and to develop effective distillation methods for ViTs.

Method: Two-view representation analysis: layer-wise SVD showing global low-rank structure, and token-level Spectral Energy Pattern analysis revealing high-bandwidth encoding. Proposed two strategies: post-hoc feature lifting with lightweight projector, and native width alignment of student's last block.

Result: Successfully reactivated feature-map distillation for ViTs, raising DeiT-Tiny accuracy from 74.86% to 77.53% and 78.23% when distilling from CaiT-S24. Also improved standalone students without teachers.

Conclusion: ViT feature distillation fails due to encoding mismatch despite low-rank structure. Exploiting this low-rank structure with simple strategies yields effective, interpretable remedies and concrete design guidance for compact ViTs.

Abstract: Feature-map knowledge distillation (KD) is highly effective for convolutional networks but often fails for Vision Transformers (ViTs). To understand this failure and guide method design, we conduct a two-view representation analysis of ViTs. First, a layer-wise Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of full feature matrices shows that final-layer representations are globally low-rank: for CaiT-S24, only $121/61/34/14$ dimensions suffice to capture $99\%/95\%/90\%/80\%$ of the energy. In principle, this suggests that a compact student plus a simple linear projector should be enough for feature alignment, contradicting the weak empirical performance of standard feature KD. To resolve this paradox, we introduce a token-level Spectral Energy Pattern (SEP) analysis that measures how each token uses channel capacity. SEP reveals that, despite the global low-rank structure, individual tokens distribute energy over most channels, forming a high-bandwidth encoding pattern. This results in an encoding mismatch between wide teachers and narrow students. Motivated by this insight, we propose two minimal, mismatch-driven strategies: (1) post-hoc feature lifting with a lightweight projector retained during inference, or (2) native width alignment that widens only the student's last block to the teacher's width. On ImageNet-1K, these strategies reactivate simple feature-map distillation in ViTs, raising DeiT-Tiny accuracy from $74.86\%$ to $77.53\%$ and $78.23\%$ when distilling from CaiT-S24, while also improving standalone students trained without any teacher. Our analysis thus explains why ViT feature distillation fails and shows how exploiting low-rank structure yields effective, interpretable remedies and concrete design guidance for compact ViTs.

Conclusion: AVATAAR provides a scalable solution for long-form Video QA that effectively merges accuracy, interpretability, and extensibility through its modular design and iterative reasoning approach.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of video content, effectively understanding and answering questions about long form videos has become essential for numerous applications. Although large vision language models (LVLMs) have enhanced performance, they often face challenges with nuanced queries that demand both a comprehensive understanding and detailed analysis. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AVATAAR, a modular and interpretable framework that combines global and local video context, along with a Pre Retrieval Thinking Agent and a Rethink Module. AVATAAR creates a persistent global summary and establishes a feedback loop between the Rethink Module and the Pre Retrieval Thinking Agent, allowing the system to refine its retrieval strategies based on partial answers and replicate human-like iterative reasoning. On the CinePile benchmark, AVATAAR demonstrates significant improvements over a baseline, achieving relative gains of +5.6% in temporal reasoning, +5% in technical queries, +8% in theme-based questions, and +8.2% in narrative comprehension. Our experiments confirm that each module contributes positively to the overall performance, with the feedback loop being crucial for adaptability. These findings highlight AVATAAR's effectiveness in enhancing video understanding capabilities. Ultimately, AVATAAR presents a scalable solution for long-form Video Question Answering (QA), merging accuracy, interpretability, and extensibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompTrack is a novel 3D single object tracking framework that addresses dual-redundancy challenges in LiDAR point clouds by eliminating spatial redundancy from background noise and informational redundancy within foreground objects, achieving real-time performance at 90 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D trackers are limited by the inherent sparsity of point clouds, which introduces dual-redundancy: spatial redundancy from background noise that impairs accuracy, and informational redundancy within foreground that hinders efficiency.

Method: Proposes CompTrack with two key modules: (1) Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) that filters background noise using information entropy, and (2) Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) that uses online SVD analysis for low-rank approximation to compress redundant foreground into compact proxy tokens.

Result: Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

Conclusion: CompTrack effectively addresses the dual-redundancy challenge in 3D point cloud tracking, achieving both high accuracy and real-time efficiency through systematic elimination of spatial and informational redundancies.

Abstract: 3D single object tracking (SOT) in LiDAR point clouds is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous driving. Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.

TL;DR: KDF+ is a continual learning framework for LiDAR place recognition that addresses catastrophic forgetting through loss-aware sampling and rehearsal enhancement, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LiDAR place recognition methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new environments, losing previously learned knowledge. This limits their practical deployment in changing real-world scenarios.

Method: Extends KDF paradigm with: 1) Loss-aware sampling that estimates learning difficulty via loss values and prioritizes harder samples for replay, 2) Rehearsal enhancement that refines memory samples during new-task training by reducing their loss relative to previous tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show KDF+ consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods and can be integrated into state-of-the-art frameworks to yield significant and stable performance gains.

Conclusion: KDF+ effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting in LiDAR place recognition through intelligent sampling and rehearsal mechanisms, enabling robust adaptation to new environments while preserving long-term knowledge.

Abstract: LiDAR place recognition plays a crucial role in SLAM, robot navigation, and autonomous driving. However, existing LiDAR place recognition methods often struggle to adapt to new environments without forgetting previously learned knowledge, a challenge widely known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this issue, we propose KDF+, a novel continual learning framework for LiDAR place recognition that extends the KDF paradigm with a loss-aware sampling strategy and a rehearsal enhancement mechanism. The proposed sampling strategy estimates the learning difficulty of each sample via its loss value and selects samples for replay according to their estimated difficulty. Harder samples, which tend to encode more discriminative information, are sampled with higher probability while maintaining distributional coverage across the dataset. In addition, the rehearsal enhancement mechanism encourages memory samples to be further refined during new-task training by slightly reducing their loss relative to previous tasks, thereby reinforcing long-term knowledge retention. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KDF+ consistently outperforms existing continual learning methods and can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art continual learning for LiDAR place recognition frameworks to yield significant and stable performance gains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-modal deep learning method that uses a single X-ray image to complete occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound spine imaging, overcoming ultrasound's limitations in visualizing vertebral bodies due to bone shadowing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound has limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy due to acoustic shadowing from bone, despite being radiation-free and cost-effective for spinal procedures.

Method: Generate paired training data with 2D lateral vertebral views (simulating X-ray) and 3D partial vertebrae representations (mimicking ultrasound limitations), then use multi-modal deep learning to integrate information from both modalities.

Result: Significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlaid on ultrasound without needing CT registration.

Conclusion: Integrating a single X-ray projection effectively mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality for spinal procedures.

Abstract: Ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective solution for real-time visualization of spinal landmarks, paraspinal soft tissues and neurovascular structures, making it valuable for intraoperative guidance during spinal procedures. However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

Motivation: Traditional point-wise convolutional segmentation heads have rigid design limitations that restrict feature sharing and semantic generalization in medical image segmentation.

Method: Proposes a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates multi-class prediction into class-agnostic mask prediction and class label prediction using shared object queries, along with a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module for memory-efficient full-scale feature fusion.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing nnUNet by +2.0% Dice on AMOS 2022 and +6.9% Dice on BTCV datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed MaskMed method effectively addresses limitations of traditional segmentation heads and enables better feature sharing and semantic generalization in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation typically adopts a point-wise convolutional segmentation head to predict dense labels, where each output channel is heuristically tied to a specific class. This rigid design limits both feature sharing and semantic generalization. In this work, we propose a unified decoupled segmentation head that separates multi-class prediction into class-agnostic mask prediction and class label prediction using shared object queries. Furthermore, we introduce a Full-Scale Aware Deformable Transformer module that enables low-resolution encoder features to attend across full-resolution encoder features via deformable attention, achieving memory-efficient and spatially aligned full-scale fusion. Our proposed method, named MaskMed, achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing nnUNet by +2.0% Dice on AMOS 2022 and +6.9% Dice on BTCV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models generate high-quality 3D meshes but suffer from slow token-by-token decoding, limiting practical use in interactive and large-scale applications.

Method: Introduces a predict-correct-verify paradigm with speculative decoding tailored to hourglass transformer architecture, enabling parallel prediction across face, point, and coordinate levels by leveraging structural and geometric correlations in mesh tokens.

Result: Achieves up to 2x speedup over standard autoregressive models while also improving generation fidelity.

Conclusion: Structural priors in mesh data can be systematically harnessed to accelerate and enhance autoregressive generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive models can generate high-quality 3D meshes by sequentially producing vertices and faces, but their token-by-token decoding results in slow inference, limiting practical use in interactive and large-scale applications. We present FlashMesh, a fast and high-fidelity mesh generation framework that rethinks autoregressive decoding through a predict-correct-verify paradigm. The key insight is that mesh tokens exhibit strong structural and geometric correlations that enable confident multi-token speculation. FlashMesh leverages this by introducing a speculative decoding scheme tailored to the commonly used hourglass transformer architecture, enabling parallel prediction across face, point, and coordinate levels. Extensive experiments show that FlashMesh achieves up to a 2 x speedup over standard autoregressive models while also improving generation fidelity. Our results demonstrate that structural priors in mesh data can be systematically harnessed to accelerate and enhance autoregressive generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for multi-animal tracking are limited in scale, species diversity, and geographical coverage, lacking suitable benchmarks for training general-purpose models applicable across wild animal populations.

Method: Collected 11,609 camera trap videos over 10 years from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated with bounding boxes, segmentation masks, species labels, and masklet identities.

Result: Created ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual annotations. Benchmarked state-of-the-art vision-language models (including SAM 3) with species-specific and generic animal prompts.

Conclusion: SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset combining high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, providing a foundation for advancing generalizable multi-animal tracking in wildlife conservation.

Abstract: Automated video analysis is critical for wildlife conservation. A foundational task in this domain is multi-animal tracking (MAT), which underpins applications such as individual re-identification and behavior recognition. However, existing datasets are limited in scale, constrained to a few species, or lack sufficient temporal and geographical diversity - leaving no suitable benchmark for training general-purpose MAT models applicable across wild animal populations. To address this, we introduce SA-FARI, the largest open-source MAT dataset for wild animals. It comprises 11,609 camera trap videos collected over approximately 10 years (2014-2024) from 741 locations across 4 continents, spanning 99 species categories. Each video is exhaustively annotated culminating in ~46 hours of densely annotated footage containing 16,224 masklet identities and 942,702 individual bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and species labels. Alongside the task-specific annotations, we publish anonymized camera trap locations for each video. Finally, we present comprehensive benchmarks on SA-FARI using state-of-the-art vision-language models for detection and tracking, including SAM 3, evaluated with both species-specific and generic animal prompts. We also compare against vision-only methods developed specifically for wildlife analysis. SA-FARI is the first large-scale dataset to combine high species diversity, multi-region coverage, and high-quality spatio-temporal annotations, offering a new foundation for advancing generalizable multianimal tracking in the wild.

### [121] [Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15633)
*Tao Hu,Lan Li,Zhen-Hao Xie,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HASTEN introduces hierarchical semantic tree anchoring to reduce catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning by embedding visual and textual features in hyperbolic space using external knowledge graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to capture the inherent hierarchical nature of real-world visual and linguistic concepts, leading to fine-grained class features drift and catastrophic forgetting during incremental updates.

Method: 1) Use external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual/textual features in hyperbolic space to preserve hierarchical structure; 2) Project gradients onto null space of shared hyperbolic mapper to prevent interference with prior tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments show HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing unified structured representation.

Conclusion: HASTEN effectively reduces catastrophic forgetting in CIL by maintaining hierarchical relationships through hyperbolic embeddings and gradient projection techniques.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually while preserving past knowledge. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like "dog" subsumes fine-grained categories such as "Labrador" and "Golden Retriever," and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments show that HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing a unified structured representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound Strain Elastography faces limitations due to tissue decorrelation noise, scarcity of ground truth data, and inconsistent strain estimation under varying deformation conditions, which hinder its clinical adoption.

Method: Proposed MUSSE-Net with USSE-Net backbone - a multi-stream encoder-decoder that processes pre- and post-deformation RF sequences using Context-Aware Complementary Feature Fusion encoder, Tri-Cross Attention bottleneck, and Cross-Attentive Fusion decoder with consistency loss for temporal coherence.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with target SNR 24.54, background SNR 132.76, CNR 59.81, and elastographic SNR 9.73 on simulation data. On clinical datasets, produced enhanced lesion-to-background contrast with significant noise suppression and clinically interpretable strain patterns.

Conclusion: MUSSE-Net outperforms existing unsupervised approaches and provides robust, consistent strain estimation suitable for clinical applications, demonstrating enhanced diagnostic value through improved strain map quality.

Abstract: Ultrasound Strain Elastography (USE) is a powerful non-invasive imaging technique for assessing tissue mechanical properties, offering crucial diagnostic value across diverse clinical applications. However, its clinical application remains limited by tissue decorrelation noise, scarcity of ground truth, and inconsistent strain estimation under different deformation conditions. Overcoming these barriers, we propose MUSSE-Net, a residual-aware, multi-stage unsupervised sequential deep learning framework designed for robust and consistent strain estimation. At its backbone lies our proposed USSE-Net, an end-to-end multi-stream encoder-decoder architecture that parallelly processes pre- and post-deformation RF sequences to estimate displacement fields and axial strains. The novel architecture incorporates Context-Aware Complementary Feature Fusion (CACFF)-based encoder with Tri-Cross Attention (TCA) bottleneck with a Cross-Attentive Fusion (CAF)-based sequential decoder. To ensure temporal coherence and strain stability across varying deformation levels, this architecture leverages a tailored consistency loss. Finally, with the MUSSE-Net framework, a secondary residual refinement stage further enhances accuracy and suppresses noise. Extensive validation on simulation, in vivo, and private clinical datasets from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) medical center, demonstrates MUSSE-Net's outperformed existing unsupervised approaches. On MUSSE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with a target SNR of 24.54, background SNR of 132.76, CNR of 59.81, and elastographic SNR of 9.73 on simulation data. In particular, on the BUET dataset, MUSSE-Net produces strain maps with enhanced lesion-to-background contrast and significant noise suppression yielding clinically interpretable strain patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To re-evaluate the effectiveness of global coordinate frame in pedestrian inertial odometry after recent drone studies showed body frame superiority, and to leverage Mamba architecture for improved motion modeling.

Method: Decomposes IMU measurements into high/low-frequency components using Laplacian pyramid, processes low-frequency with Mamba architecture for contextual motion cues, and high-frequency with convolutional structure for local motion details.

Result: Substantially reduces localization error and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public datasets.

Conclusion: MambaIO demonstrates superior performance for pedestrian inertial odometry and represents the first application of Mamba architecture to this task.

Abstract: Inertial Odometry (IO) enables real-time localization using only acceleration and angular velocity measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), making it a promising solution for localization in consumer-grade applications. Traditionally, IMU measurements in IO have been processed under two coordinate system paradigms: the body coordinate frame and the global coordinate frame, with the latter being widely adopted. However, recent studies in drone scenarios have demonstrated that the body frame can significantly improve localization accuracy, prompting a re-evaluation of the suitability of the global frame for pedestrian IO. To address this issue, this paper systematically evaluates the effectiveness of the global coordinate frame in pedestrian IO through theoretical analysis, qualitative inspection, and quantitative experiments. Building upon these findings, we further propose MambaIO, which decomposes IMU measurements into high-frequency and low-frequency components using a Laplacian pyramid. The low-frequency component is processed by a Mamba architecture to extract implicit contextual motion cues, while the high-frequency component is handled by a convolutional structure to capture fine-grained local motion details. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that MambaIO substantially reduces localization error and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of the Mamba architecture to the inertial odometry task.

Result: The system significantly reduces search time compared to traditional methods and enables diverse scientific applications through five case studies, including seasonal behavior variation and forest regrowth after wildfires.

Conclusion: INQUIRE-Search represents a new paradigm for interactive, efficient scientific discovery that unlocks previously inaccessible value in biodiversity datasets, requiring experts to reframe scientific priorities and develop novel methods for experiment design and uncertainty analysis.

Abstract: Large community science platforms such as iNaturalist contain hundreds of millions of biodiversity images that often capture ecological context on behaviors, interactions, phenology, and habitat. Yet most ecological workflows rely on metadata filtering or manual inspection, leaving this secondary information inaccessible at scale. We introduce INQUIRE-Search, an open-source system that enables scientists to rapidly and interactively search within an ecological image database for specific concepts using natural language, verify and export relevant observations, and utilize this discovered data for novel scientific analysis. Compared to traditional methods, INQUIRE-Search takes a fraction of the time, opening up new possibilities for scientific questions that can be explored. Through five case studies, we show the diversity of scientific applications that a tool like INQUIRE-Search can support, from seasonal variation in behavior across species to forest regrowth after wildfires. These examples demonstrate a new paradigm for interactive, efficient, and scalable scientific discovery that can begin to unlock previously inaccessible scientific value in large-scale biodiversity datasets. Finally, we emphasize using such AI-enabled discovery tools for science call for experts to reframe the priorities of the scientific process and develop novel methods for experiment design, data collection, survey effort, and uncertainty analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of standardized evaluation protocols for Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) in Earth Observation, enabling fair comparison and methodological innovation.

Method: Comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 datasets, with capability groups to rank models based on shared characteristics like resolution, bands, and temporality.

Result: No single model dominates across all tasks; natural image pretrained models excel on high-resolution tasks, while EO-specific models outperform on multispectral applications like agriculture and disaster response.

Conclusion: Optimal model choice depends on task requirements and data modalities, and a single GeoFM that performs well across all tasks remains an open research challenge. GEO-Bench-2 enables reproducible, use-case-specific evaluation.

Abstract: Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) are transforming Earth Observation (EO), but evaluation lacks standardized protocols. GEO-Bench-2 addresses this with a comprehensive framework spanning classification, segmentation, regression, object detection, and instance segmentation across 19 permissively-licensed datasets. We introduce ''capability'' groups to rank models on datasets that share common characteristics (e.g., resolution, bands, temporality). This enables users to identify which models excel in each capability and determine which areas need improvement in future work. To support both fair comparison and methodological innovation, we define a prescriptive yet flexible evaluation protocol. This not only ensures consistency in benchmarking but also facilitates research into model adaptation strategies, a key and open challenge in advancing GeoFMs for downstream tasks.
  Our experiments show that no single model dominates across all tasks, confirming the specificity of the choices made during architecture design and pretraining. While models pretrained on natural images (ConvNext ImageNet, DINO V3) excel on high-resolution tasks, EO-specific models (TerraMind, Prithvi, and Clay) outperform them on multispectral applications such as agriculture and disaster response. These findings demonstrate that optimal model choice depends on task requirements, data modalities, and constraints. This shows that the goal of a single GeoFM model that performs well across all tasks remains open for future research. GEO-Bench-2 enables informed, reproducible GeoFM evaluation tailored to specific use cases. Code, data, and leaderboard for GEO-Bench-2 are publicly released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: A Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN) using eye tracking, audio, and video data achieves superior depression detection performance by leveraging both low and high frequency signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitation of existing graph-based models that focus only on low-frequency information and improve depression detection using multimodal data.

Method: Proposed MF-GCN framework with Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM) that captures both low and high frequency signals from eye tracking, audio, and video data.

Result: Achieved sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94 for binary classification, and sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 for 3-class classification. Generalization on CMDC dataset showed sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96.

Conclusion: The trimodal, multi-frequency framework effectively captures cross-modal interactions for accurate depression detection and significantly outperforms other models.

Abstract: Eye tracking data quantifies the attentional bias towards negative stimuli that is frequently observed in depressed groups. Audio and video data capture the affective flattening and psychomotor retardation characteristic of depression. Statistical validation confirmed their significant discriminative power in distinguishing depressed from non depressed groups. We address a critical limitation of existing graph-based models that focus on low-frequency information and propose a Multi-Frequency Graph Convolutional Network (MF-GCN). This framework consists of a novel Multi-Frequency Filter Bank Module (MFFBM), which can leverage both low and high frequency signals. Extensive evaluation against traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning frameworks demonstrates that MF-GCN consistently outperforms baselines. In binary (depressed and non depressed) classification, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.96 and F2 score of 0.94. For the 3 class (no depression, mild to moderate depression and severe depression) classification task, the proposed method achieved a sensitivity of 0.79 and specificity of 0.87 and siginificantly suprassed other models. To validate generalizability, the model was also evaluated on the Chinese Multimodal Depression Corpus (CMDC) dataset and achieved a sensitivity of 0.95 and F2 score of 0.96.

TL;DR: Video generation models implicitly use the first frame as a conceptual memory buffer for visual entities, enabling robust video content customization with minimal training examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the traditional view that the first frame is merely a spatial-temporal starting point and reveal its role as a conceptual memory buffer in video generation models.

Method: Leverage the insight that first frames serve as memory buffers to achieve video content customization using only 20-50 training examples, without architectural changes or large-scale finetuning.

Result: Demonstrated robust and generalized video content customization across diverse scenarios using minimal training data.

Conclusion: Video generation models possess a powerful, overlooked capability for reference-based video customization through their implicit treatment of first frames as conceptual memory buffers.

Abstract: What role does the first frame play in video generation models? Traditionally, it's viewed as the spatial-temporal starting point of a video, merely a seed for subsequent animation. In this work, we reveal a fundamentally different perspective: video models implicitly treat the first frame as a conceptual memory buffer that stores visual entities for later reuse during generation. Leveraging this insight, we show that it's possible to achieve robust and generalized video content customization in diverse scenarios, using only 20-50 training examples without architectural changes or large-scale finetuning. This unveils a powerful, overlooked capability of video generation models for reference-based video customization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoVista is an agentic model for geolocalization that integrates image zoom and web search tools within reasoning loops, trained with SFT and RL, achieving performance comparable to closed-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic visual reasoning focuses on image manipulation but lacks general-purpose capabilities for tasks requiring nuanced visual grounding and web search, like geolocalization. Existing benchmarks don't meet the needs for high-resolution imagery and deep agentic reasoning.

Method: Proposed GeoVista model with integrated tool invocation (image zoom and web search) in reasoning loops. Training pipeline includes SFT for reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by RL with hierarchical rewards using multi-level geographical information.

Result: GeoVista greatly surpasses other open-source agentic models on geolocalization and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models (Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5) on most metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed GeoVista model with integrated tool use and hierarchical training effectively addresses geolocalization challenges, demonstrating strong performance that bridges the gap between open-source and closed-source agentic models.

Abstract: Current research on agentic visual reasoning enables deep multimodal understanding but primarily focuses on image manipulation tools, leaving a gap toward more general-purpose agentic models. In this work, we revisit the geolocalization task, which requires not only nuanced visual grounding but also web search to confirm or refine hypotheses during reasoning. Since existing geolocalization benchmarks fail to meet the need for high-resolution imagery and the localization challenge for deep agentic reasoning, we curate GeoBench, a benchmark that includes photos and panoramas from around the world, along with a subset of satellite images of different cities to rigorously evaluate the geolocalization ability of agentic models. We also propose GeoVista, an agentic model that seamlessly integrates tool invocation within the reasoning loop, including an image-zoom-in tool to magnify regions of interest and a web-search tool to retrieve related web information. We develop a complete training pipeline for it, including a cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to learn reasoning patterns and tool-use priors, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) stage to further enhance reasoning ability. We adopt a hierarchical reward to leverage multi-level geographical information and improve overall geolocalization performance. Experimental results show that GeoVista surpasses other open-source agentic models on the geolocalization task greatly and achieves performance comparable to closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-flash and GPT-5 on most metrics.

TL;DR: A novel dense feature matching model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy through architectural improvements, optimized training pipeline, and integration of DINOv3 foundation model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dense matchers fail or perform poorly in hard real-world scenarios, and high-precision models are often too slow for practical applications.

Method: Constructed novel matching architecture and loss, curated diverse training distribution, implemented decoupled two-stage matching-then-refinement pipeline with custom CUDA kernel for memory efficiency, and leveraged DINOv3 foundation model.

Result: The resulting matcher sets a new state-of-the-art, being significantly more accurate than its predecessors across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The systematic improvements yield a significantly better dense feature matching model that solves many complex matching tasks with high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Dense feature matching aims to estimate all correspondences between two images of a 3D scene and has recently been established as the gold-standard due to its high accuracy and robustness. However, existing dense matchers still fail or perform poorly for many hard real-world scenarios, and high-precision models are often slow, limiting their applicability. In this paper, we attack these weaknesses on a wide front through a series of systematic improvements that together yield a significantly better model. In particular, we construct a novel matching architecture and loss, which, combined with a curated diverse training distribution, enables our model to solve many complex matching tasks. We further make training faster through a decoupled two-stage matching-then-refinement pipeline, and at the same time, significantly reduce refinement memory usage through a custom CUDA kernel. Finally, we leverage the recent DINOv3 foundation model along with multiple other insights to make the model more robust and unbiased. In our extensive set of experiments we show that the resulting novel matcher sets a new state-of-the-art, being significantly more accurate than its predecessors.

Conclusion: ChartEditVista addresses the gap in realistic chart editing benchmarks, while ChartEditor demonstrates superior performance through its reinforcement learning approach with rendering rewards, enabling effective chart editing from images and natural language instructions.

Abstract: Chart editing reduces manual effort in visualization design. Typical benchmarks limited in data diversity and assume access to complete chart code, which is seldom in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we present ChartEditVista, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7,964 samples spanning 31 chart categories. It encompasses diverse editing instructions and covers nearly all editable chart elements. The inputs in ChartEditVista include only the original chart image and natural language editing instructions, without the original chart codes. ChartEditVista is generated through a fully automated pipeline that produces, edits, and verifies charts, ensuring high-quality chart editing data. Besides, we introduce two novel fine-grained, rule-based evaluation metrics: the layout metric, which evaluates the position, size and color of graphical components; and the text metric, which jointly assesses textual content and font styling. Building on top of ChartEditVista, we present ChartEditor, a model trained using a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a novel rendering reward to simultaneously enforce code executability and visual fidelity. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we demonstrate that ChartEditVista provides a robust evaluation, while ChartEditor consistently outperforms models with similar-scale and larger-scale on chart editing tasks.

TL;DR: Rogue One is a multi-agent LLM framework for automated feature engineering that uses three specialized agents (Scientist, Extractor, Tester) with qualitative feedback and RAG integration to generate interpretable, predictive features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AutoFE methods using LLMs are limited by monolithic architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and lack of systematic domain knowledge integration, hindering feature quality and interpretability.

Method: Decentralized multi-agent system with three specialized agents collaborating iteratively, using qualitative feedback mechanisms, flooding-pruning strategy for exploration-exploitation balance, and RAG for external knowledge integration.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 19 classification and 9 regression datasets, and generates novel scientific hypotheses like identifying a new potential biomarker in myocardial dataset.

Conclusion: Rogue One demonstrates superior performance in automated feature engineering while producing semantically meaningful, interpretable features that can facilitate scientific discovery beyond just predictive modeling.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a "flooding-pruning" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal reasoning models lack the human-like ability to autonomously explore diverse reasoning pathways and adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks.

Method: Proposes Octopus with six core capabilities for multimodal reasoning, enabling autonomous exploration and dynamic capability selection based on current state.

Result: Experimental results show Octopus achieves best performance on vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the importance of capability coordination.

Conclusion: Capability coordination is crucial for agentic multimodal reasoning, and Octopus demonstrates the effectiveness of autonomous exploration and dynamic capability selection.

Abstract: Existing multimodal reasoning models and frameworks suffer from fundamental architectural limitations: most lack the human-like ability to autonomously explore diverse reasoning pathways-whether in direct inference, tool-driven visual exploration, programmatic visual manipulation, or intrinsic visual imagination. Consequently, they struggle to adapt to dynamically changing capability requirements in real-world tasks. Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions. Inspired by this, we propose Octopus: Agentic Multimodal Reasoning with Six-Capability Orchestration, a new paradigm for multimodal agentic reasoning. We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state. Experimental results show that Octopus achieves the best performance on the vast majority of tasks in Octopus-Bench, highlighting the crucial role of capability coordination in agentic multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner) combines world-model rollouts with VLM reasoning to achieve human-like physical reasoning in games, outperforming GPT-5 on curiosity tasks and showing improved performance with more training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if agents can acquire human-like reasoning through interaction and improve with experience, similar to how humans learn physics and causality.

Method: Proposed IPR using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce VLM policies, and introduced PhysCode for physics-centric action alignment. Trained on 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical mechanisms.

Result: IPR performs robustly across three reasoning levels (Survival, Curiosity, Utility), matches GPT-5 overall, surpasses it on Curiosity, and shows zero-shot transfer to unseen games. Performance improves with more training games and interaction steps.

Conclusion: Physics-centric interaction provides a path to steadily improving physical reasoning capabilities in AI agents.

Abstract: Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. We study this in a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) setting, curating 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical and causal mechanisms, and evaluate at three human-like levels: Survival, Curiosity, Utility, from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning. Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning.

*Jun Hyeun Kang,Jung Eek Son,Tae In Ahn*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: This study uses AI to analyze how spectral-shifting films in greenhouses affect crop yields by examining multiple plant traits and light conditions, achieving 91.4% classification accuracy with neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous research showed variable growth responses to spectral-shifting films across crops, and focusing on single attributes had limitations in understanding the relationship between light quality adjustments and crop performance.

Method: Collected 210 data points from various crops grown under spectral-shifting films, measured multiple traits (leaf reflectance, mass per area, chlorophyll, light integral, saturation point), used variational autoencoder for data augmentation, and trained multiple ML models for binary classification of yield effects.

Result: Most crops showed average 22.5% yield increase under spectral-shifting films, and feedforward neural network achieved 91.4% classification accuracy on test data for predicting yield effects.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into complex interactions between plant traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components, improving prediction of spectral shift effects using AI approaches.

Abstract: The application of spectral-shifting films in greenhouses to shift green light to red light has shown variable growth responses across crop species. However, the yield enhancement of crops under altered light quality is related to the collective effects of the specific biophysical characteristics of each species. Considering only one attribute of a crop has limitations in understanding the relationship between sunlight quality adjustments and crop growth performance. Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training. This study provide insight into the complex interactions between leaf phenotypic and photosynthetic traits, environmental conditions, and solar spectral components by improving the ability to predict solar spectral shift effects using SF.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: RAG system for agricultural applications using AMF, combining semantic retrieval with structured data extraction to enhance response accuracy and factual reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of static LLMs by dynamically integrating domain-specific knowledge for agricultural applications, particularly focusing on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in sustainable agriculture.

Method: Dual-layered strategy: (1) semantic retrieval and augmentation using vector embeddings from agronomy/biotechnology corpora, (2) structured data extraction for experimental metadata; uses high-performance vector database for scalability.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows successful retrieval and synthesis of highly relevant AMF-crop interaction information, particularly for tomato systems, with near real-time performance.

Conclusion: RAG framework demonstrates potential for accelerating agroecological innovation and enhancing decision-making in sustainable farming through AI-driven knowledge discovery.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a transformative approach within natural language processing (NLP), combining neural information retrieval with generative language modeling to enhance both contextual accuracy and factual reliability of responses. Unlike conventional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are constrained by static training corpora, RAG-powered systems dynamically integrate domain-specific external knowledge sources, thereby overcoming temporal and disciplinary limitations. In this study, we present the design and evaluation of a RAG-enabled system tailored for Mycophyto, with a focus on advancing agricultural applications related to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing nutrient acquisition, improving plant resilience under abiotic and biotic stresses, and contributing to soil health. Our system operationalizes a dual-layered strategy: (i) semantic retrieval and augmentation of domain-specific content from agronomy and biotechnology corpora using vector embeddings, and (ii) structured data extraction to capture predefined experimental metadata such as inoculation methods, spore densities, soil parameters, and yield outcomes. This hybrid approach ensures that generated responses are not only semantically aligned but also supported by structured experimental evidence. To support scalability, embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, allowing near real-time retrieval from an evolving literature base. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline retrieves and synthesizes highly relevant information regarding AMF interactions with crop systems, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The framework underscores the potential of AI-driven knowledge discovery to accelerate agroecological innovation and enhance decision-making in sustainable farming systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CAR is a dynamic retrieval algorithm that adapts the number of retrieved documents based on query complexity by analyzing clustering patterns in similarity distances, outperforming static top-k approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static top-k retrieval fails to adapt to varying query complexities - narrow queries need fewer documents while broad queries need more, leading to either insufficient context or redundant information.

Method: Cluster-based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR) analyzes clustering patterns of ordered query-document similarity distances to detect transition points where highly relevant documents shift to less pertinent ones, establishing an adaptive cut-off.

Result: CAR achieves highest TES score, cuts LLM token usage by 60%, reduces latency by 22%, cuts hallucinations by 10% while preserving answer relevance, and increased user engagement by 200% in production.

Conclusion: CAR provides an effective dynamic retrieval approach that adapts to query complexity, significantly improving RAG performance across multiple metrics compared to static baselines.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by pulling in external material, document, code, manuals, from vast and ever-growing corpora, to effectively answer user queries. The effectiveness of RAG depends significantly on aligning the number of retrieved documents with query characteristics: narrowly focused queries typically require fewer, highly relevant documents, whereas broader or ambiguous queries benefit from retrieving more extensive supporting information. However, the common static top-k retrieval approach fails to adapt to this variability, resulting in either insufficient context from too few documents or redundant information from too many. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce Cluster-based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR), an algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of documents by analyzing the clustering patterns of ordered query-document similarity distances. CAR detects the transition point within similarity distances, where tightly clustered, highly relevant documents shift toward less pertinent candidates, establishing an adaptive cut-off that scales with query complexity. On Coinbase's CDP corpus and the public MultiHop-RAG benchmark, CAR consistently picks the optimal retrieval depth and achieves the highest TES score, outperforming every fixed top-k baseline. In downstream RAG evaluations, CAR cuts LLM token usage by 60%, trims end-to-end latency by 22%, and reduces hallucinations by 10% while fully preserving answer relevance. Since integrating CAR into Coinbase's virtual assistant, we've seen user engagement jump by 200%.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CroPS introduces cross-perspective positive samples from query-level, system-level, and knowledge-level sources to overcome filter bubble effects in dense retrieval systems, using hierarchical label assignment and H-InfoNCE loss for improved training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current industrial dense retrieval systems suffer from filter bubble effects due to self-reinforcing training pipelines that rely only on historically exposed user interactions, excluding potentially relevant unseen content and creating conservative retrieval biases.

Method: CroPS leverages three perspectives: query-level (user query reformulation), system-level (recommendation engagement data), and knowledge-level (LLM-synthesized world knowledge). It uses Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and H-InfoNCE loss for fine-grained optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on Kuaishou Search platform show CroPS significantly outperforms baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. Now deployed serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

Conclusion: CroPS effectively mitigates filter bubble effects in dense retrieval systems by incorporating diverse positive samples from multiple perspectives, leading to improved retrieval quality and user experience in large-scale commercial applications.

Abstract: Dense retrieval has become a foundational paradigm in modern search systems, especially on short-video platforms. However, most industrial systems adopt a self-reinforcing training pipeline that relies on historically exposed user interactions for supervision. This paradigm inevitably leads to a filter bubble effect, where potentially relevant but previously unseen content is excluded from the training signal, biasing the model toward narrow and conservative retrieval. In this paper, we present CroPS (Cross-Perspective Positive Samples), a novel retrieval data engine designed to alleviate this problem by introducing diverse and semantically meaningful positive examples from multiple perspectives. CroPS enhances training with positive signals derived from user query reformulation behavior (query-level), engagement data in recommendation streams (system-level), and world knowledge synthesized by large language models (knowledge-level). To effectively utilize these heterogeneous signals, we introduce a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) strategy and a corresponding H-InfoNCE loss that together enable fine-grained, relevance-aware optimization. Extensive experiments conducted on Kuaishou Search, a large-scale commercial short-video search platform, demonstrate that CroPS significantly outperforms strong baselines both offline and in live A/B tests, achieving superior retrieval performance and reducing query reformulation rates. CroPS is now fully deployed in Kuaishou Search, serving hundreds of millions of users daily.

TL;DR: GTPO is a novel RL algorithm that improves multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning in LLMs through turn-level rewards, return-based advantage estimation, and self-supervised reward shaping, outperforming GRPO by 3.0% on reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like GRPO use coarse-grained trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning, leading to training stagnation.

Method: GTPO introduces three innovations: turn-level reward assignment, return-based advantage estimation using normalized discounted returns, and self-supervised reward shaping that exploits code generation signals to densify sparse binary rewards.

Result: GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved effectiveness for complex mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: GTPO effectively addresses the limitations of existing RL approaches for multi-turn TIR by providing fine-grained learning signals, establishing it as an advancement for training LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) for multi-turn Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) - where models iteratively reason, generate code, and verify through execution - remains challenging for existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Current RL methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), suffer from coarse-grained, trajectory-level rewards that provide insufficient learning signals for complex multi-turn interactions, leading to training stagnation. To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.

Methods include knowledge distillation from DP-trained teachers, direct DP-SGD, and DP-synthetic data training.

Result: At moderate privacy budgets (ε ∈ {4, 6}), knowledge distillation outperforms both direct DP-SGD and DP-synthetic data training, recovering up to 63% of non-private performance while maintaining strong empirical privacy (membership-inference AUC ≈ 0.5).

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is identified as the most practical route to privacy-preserving clinical NLP, with large differences in privacy-utility trade-off across architectures.

Abstract: Large language models trained on clinical text risk exposing sensitive patient information, yet differential privacy (DP) methods often severely degrade the diagnostic accuracy needed for deployment. Despite rapid progress in DP optimisation and text generation, it remains unclear which privacy-preserving strategy actually works best for clinical language tasks. We present the first systematic head-to-head comparison of four training pipelines for automated diagnostic coding from hospital discharge summaries. All pipelines use identical 1B-parameter models and matched privacy budgets to predict ICD-9 codes. At moderate and relaxed privacy budgets ($\varepsilon \in \{4, 6\}$), knowledge distillation from DP-trained teachers outperforms both direct DP-SGD and DP-synthetic data training, recovering up to 63\% of the non-private performance whilst maintaining strong empirical privacy (membership-inference AUC $\approx$ 0.5). These findings expose large differences in the privacy-utility trade-off across architectures and identify knowledge distillation as the most practical route to privacy-preserving clinical NLP.

*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dynamic nested hierarchies enable AI models to autonomously adjust optimization levels, nesting structures, and update frequencies during training/inference, overcoming limitations of static architectures for lifelong learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML models fail in non-stationary environments due to rigid architectures that prevent continual adaptation and suffer from anterograde amnesia, hindering true lifelong learning.

Method: Extends nested learning paradigm with dynamic hierarchies that allow autonomous adjustment of optimization levels, nesting structures, and update frequencies, inspired by neuroplasticity principles.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, with theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret.

Conclusion: Dynamic nested hierarchies represent a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence by enabling self-evolution and true lifelong learning capabilities.

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning models, including large language models, exhibit remarkable capabilities in static tasks yet falter in non-stationary environments due to rigid architectures that hinder continual adaptation and lifelong learning. Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.

TL;DR: Graph Memory (GM) is a structured non-parametric framework that enhances embedding-based inference using relational memory with region-level prototypes, achieving competitive accuracy with better calibration and smoother decision boundaries using fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning by summarizing embedding spaces into structured prototypes with reliability indicators and relational edges, rather than treating training instances in isolation.

Method: GM summarizes embedding space into prototype nodes with reliability indicators, connected by edges encoding geometric and contextual relations. It unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation in a single inductive model.

Result: GM achieves accuracy competitive with kNN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples. Demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC).

Conclusion: By explicitly modeling reliability and relational structure, GM provides a principled bridge between local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning, supporting both efficient inference and faithful explanation.

Abstract: We introduce Graph Memory (GM), a structured non-parametric framework that augments embedding-based inference with a compact, relational memory over region-level prototypes. Rather than treating each training instance in isolation, GM summarizes the embedding space into prototype nodes annotated with reliability indicators and connected by edges that encode geometric and contextual relations. This design unifies instance retrieval, prototype-based reasoning, and graph-based label propagation within a single inductive model that supports both efficient inference and faithful explanation. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets including breast histopathology (IDC) show that GM achieves accuracy competitive with $k$NN and Label Spreading while offering substantially better calibration and smoother decision boundaries, all with an order of magnitude fewer samples. By explicitly modeling reliability and relational structure, GM provides a principled bridge between local evidence and global consistency in non-parametric learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional TNM staging is inadequate for personalized medicine in colorectal cancer due to high heterogeneity, requiring better prognostic stratification tools.

Method: Multiple instance learning model trained on TCGA cohort (n=581), validated externally (n=1031), integrated multi-omics data for interpretability, identified MRPL37 through interaction network analysis.

Result: TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification, outperformed clinical staging and state-of-the-art models, identified MRPL37 as independent favorable prognostic biomarker driven by promoter hypomethylation.

Conclusion: AI-driven TDAM-CRC provides improved risk stratification, reveals molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making through a nomogram combining risk score and clinical factors.

Abstract: Precise prognostic stratification of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its high heterogeneity. The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether the successful GRPO method from LLM fine-tuning can be generalized to representation learning models, bridging the gap between policy optimization techniques across different model types.

Method: Proposes GRPO-RM which establishes predefined output sets to replace token sampling, generates output groups for probability-driven optimization, and designs specialized reward functions tailored for representation models.

Result: Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed GRPO-RM method for representation model post-training.

Conclusion: GRPO-RM successfully generalizes the GRPO framework to representation models, demonstrating its applicability beyond language models and opening new possibilities for representation learning optimization.

Abstract: The Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), has proved its effectiveness in practical applications such as DeepSeek-R1. It raises a question whether GRPO can be generalized to representation learning models. In this paper, we propose Group Relative Policy Optimization for Representation Model (GRPO-RM), and investigate the performance of GRPO-like policy in post-training representation models. Specifically, our method establishes a predefined output set to functionally replace token sequence sampling in LLMs, thereby generating an output group, which is essential for the probability-driven optimization of GRPO. In addition, a specialized reward function is designed to accommodate the properties of representation models. Extensive experiments are conducted on various real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: NINT accelerates implicit neural representation training by dynamically selecting coordinates that maximize global functional updates using Neural Tangent Kernel guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Implicit Neural Representations require optimizing over millions of coordinates for high-resolution signals, which incurs prohibitive computational costs that need to be addressed.

Method: Proposes NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT) that uses Neural Tangent Kernel to score examples by their NTK-augmented loss gradients, considering both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling).

Result: NINT significantly reduces training time by nearly half while maintaining or improving representation quality, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

Conclusion: NINT provides an effective method for accelerating implicit neural representation training through intelligent coordinate selection guided by Neural Tangent Kernel analysis.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) parameterize continuous signals via multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enabling compact, resolution-independent modeling for tasks like image, audio, and 3D reconstruction. However, fitting high-resolution signals demands optimizing over millions of coordinates, incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address it, we propose NTK-Guided Implicit Neural Teaching (NINT), which accelerates training by dynamically selecting coordinates that maximize global functional updates. Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), NINT scores examples by the norm of their NTK-augmented loss gradients, capturing both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling). This dual consideration enables faster convergence compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NINT significantly reduces training time by nearly half while maintaining or improving representation quality, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.

TL;DR: CASTELLA is a large-scale human-annotated audio benchmark for audio moment retrieval (AMR), addressing the lack of reliable real-world datasets in this field.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AMR research relies on synthetic datasets and small evaluation sets (under 100 samples), leading to unreliable performance metrics. There's a need for real-world annotated data to ensure practical application performance.

Method: Created CASTELLA - a manually annotated AMR dataset with 1,009 training, 213 validation, and 640 test audio recordings (24x larger than previous datasets). Established baseline models and compared fine-tuning approaches using synthetic pre-training.

Result: Models fine-tuned on CASTELLA after synthetic pre-training outperformed models trained solely on synthetic data by 10.4 points in Recall1@0.7 metric.

Conclusion: CASTELLA provides a reliable benchmark for AMR research and demonstrates that fine-tuning on real-world annotated data significantly improves performance over synthetic-only training.

Abstract: We introduce CASTELLA, a human-annotated audio benchmark for the task of audio moment retrieval (AMR). Although AMR has various useful potential applications, there is still no established benchmark with real-world data. The early study of AMR trained the model with solely synthetic datasets. Moreover, the evaluation is based on annotated dataset of fewer than 100 samples. This resulted in less reliable reported performance. To ensure performance for applications in real-world environments, we present CASTELLA, a large-scale manually annotated AMR dataset. CASTELLA consists of 1,009, 213, and 640 audio recordings for train, valid, and test split, respectively, which is 24 times larger than the previous dataset. We also establish a baseline model for AMR using CASTELLA. Our experiments demonstrate that a model fine-tuned on CASTELLA after pre-training on the synthetic data outperformed a model trained solely on the synthetic data by 10.4 points in Recall1@0.7. CASTELLA is publicly available in https://h-munakata.github.io/CASTELLA-demo/.

TL;DR: Transformer-based models (ViT, Swin, LINA-ViT, MAP-ViGAT) outperform CNNs for temperature prediction from fiber specklegram data, achieving MAE of 1.15°C, with XAI providing interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fiber Specklegram Sensors are effective for environmental monitoring but face challenges due to nonlinear specklegram data, requiring advanced models for accurate temperature prediction.

Method: Used transformer architectures (ViT, Swin, LINA-ViT, MAP-ViGAT) to predict temperature from specklegram data over 0-120°C range, incorporating XAI techniques like attention and saliency maps.

Result: ViTs achieved MAE of 1.15, outperforming CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants showed competitive accuracy, demonstrating adaptive attention and graph structures effectively capture complex modal interactions.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures establish strong benchmarks for optical fiber temperature sensing and offer promising directions for industrial monitoring and structural health assessment applications.

Abstract: Fiber Specklegram Sensors (FSS) are highly effective for environmental monitoring, particularly for detecting temperature variations. However, the nonlinear nature of specklegram data presents significant challenges for accurate temperature prediction. This study investigates the use of transformer-based architectures, including Vision Transformers (ViTs), Swin Transformers, and emerging models such as Learnable Importance Non-Symmetric Attention Vision Transformers (LINA-ViT) and Multi-Adaptive Proximity Vision Graph Attention Transformers (MAP-ViGAT), to predict temperature from specklegram data over a range of 0 to 120 Celsius. The results show that ViTs achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.15, outperforming traditional models such as CNNs. GAT-ViT and MAP-ViGAT variants also demonstrated competitive accuracy, highlighting the importance of adaptive attention mechanisms and graph-based structures in capturing complex modal interactions and phase shifts in specklegram data. Additionally, this study incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, including attention maps and saliency maps, to provide insights into the decision-making processes of the transformer models, improving interpretability and transparency. These findings establish transformer architectures as strong benchmarks for optical fiber-based temperature sensing and offer promising directions for industrial monitoring and structural health assessment applications.

TL;DR: TL1 regularization for image denoising outperforms traditional TV by reducing staircase artifacts and preserving contrast using ADMM optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Total variation regularization causes staircase artifacts and contrast loss due to its convex l1 formulation, limiting its effectiveness for image denoising.

Method: Proposed Transformed l1 (TL1) regularizer applied to image gradients, solved using ADMM with closed-form TL1 proximal operator and FFT-based image updates under periodic boundary conditions.

Result: Superior denoising performance compared to traditional methods, effectively suppressing noise while preserving edges and enhancing image contrast.

Conclusion: TL1 regularization provides an effective alternative to TV denoising by addressing its key limitations while maintaining computational efficiency through ADMM optimization.

Abstract: Total variation (TV) regularization is a classical tool for image denoising, but its convex $\ell_1$ formulation often leads to staircase artifacts and loss of contrast. To address these issues, we introduce the Transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) regularizer applied to image gradients. In particular, we develop a TL1-regularized denoising model and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), featuring a closed-form TL1 proximal operator and an FFT-based image update under periodic boundary conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior denoising performance, effectively suppressing noise while preserving edges and enhancing image contrast.

*Henry Wong,Clement Fung,Weiran Lin,Karen Li,Stanley Chen,Lujo Bauer*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper evaluates adversarial attacks on autonomous driving systems by testing adversarial patches against complete driving agents in CARLA simulator, showing that some agents' control modules can override manipulated ML model predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the real-world risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving by evaluating attacks against complete driving agents rather than isolated ML models, since prior work focused on misleading individual models but it's unclear if these attacks actually produce harmful driving actions.

Method: Used CARLA simulator to create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer vehicles, streamed them into simulator at runtime, and evaluated against CARLA Leaderboard agents across multiple scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations without modifying agent code.

Result: Some attacks successfully misled ML models into predicting erroneous commands, but some driving agents used modules like PID control or GPS-based rules that could overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.

Conclusion: Evaluating attacks against complete autonomous driving systems reveals that some agents have built-in safety mechanisms that can mitigate adversarial attacks, highlighting the importance of system-level evaluation rather than just testing individual ML models.

Abstract: To autonomously control vehicles, driving agents use outputs from a combination of machine-learning (ML) models, controller logic, and custom modules. Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios.
  To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model.
  We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.

TL;DR: M is a modeling language and toolchain for multi-target compilation in model-driven engineering of complex concurrent systems, enabling generation of diverse target artifacts from a single source model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional modeling languages have narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation, making multi-target compilation difficult. There's a need for a language that can systematically generate multiple heterogeneous targets from a single source model.

Method: Developed M, a textual grammar-driven language based on actor model with discrete-event scheduling semantics. Provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time/state-triggered reactions.

Result: M enables systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. It can also serve as a middle language for other modeling languages to benefit from its compilation framework.

Conclusion: M provides an effective solution for multi-target compilation in model-driven engineering, addressing the limitations of traditional narrow-focus modeling languages and supporting complex, concurrent, time-aware systems.

Abstract: Complex software-driven systems often interleave distributed, concurrent computation processes with physical interactions with the environment. Developing these systems more efficiently and safely can be achieved by employing actionable, software-based models. From a high-level system model, engineers often need to derive multiple specialized models for different purposes, including simulation, deployment, and formal verification. Each of these target models usually rely on its own formalism, specification language, and execution platform. Traditionally, a compiler analyzes a program written in a programming language and generates executable code. In contrast, a model compiler processes a source model written in a modeling language and should ideally support the generation of multiple heterogeneous targets. However, most existing modeling languages are designed with a narrow focus, typically targeting only simulation or implementation. Multi-target compilation, when not considered during the language's early design, becomes significantly harder to achieve. In this paper, we introduce our initiative: a toolchain and modeling language called M, designed to support system modeling and multi-target compilation for model-driven engineering of complex, concurrent, and time-aware systems. M is a textual, grammar-driven language based on the actor model and extended with discrete-event scheduling semantics. It provides constructs for modeling system entities, message-based interactions, and time- or state-triggered reactions. From such models, M enables the systematic generation of diverse target artifacts while preserving semantic conformance to the original model. Moreover, M can serve as a middle language to which other modeling languages may anchor, thereby allowing them to benefit from its compilation framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DocVQA datasets lack fine-grained spatial grounding, constraining the interpretability and reasoning capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs).

Method: Automated construction pipeline called 'Segment Judge and Generate' that integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification.

Result: Created dataset with 3.6K diverse documents and 32K QA pairs covering single/multi-region and single/multi-page scenarios. Benchmarking shows VLMs still struggle with spatial grounding, but fine-tuning on BBox DocVQA substantially improves both bounding box localization and answer generation.

Conclusion: BBox DocVQA effectively enhances VLMs' spatial reasoning ability and will be publicly released to advance research on interpretable and spatially grounded vision-language reasoning.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) is a fundamental task for multimodal document understanding and a key testbed for vision language reasoning. However, most existing DocVQA datasets are limited to the page level and lack fine grained spatial grounding, constraining the interpretability and reasoning capability of Vision Language Models (VLMs). To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance. The resulting dataset contains 3.6 K diverse documents and 32 K QA pairs, encompassing single and multi region as well as single and multi page scenarios. Each QA instance is grounded on explicit bounding boxes, enabling fine grained evaluation of spatial semantic alignment. Benchmarking multiple state of the art VLMs (e.g., GPT 5, Qwen2.5 VL, and InternVL) on BBox DocVQA reveals persistent challenges in spatial grounding and reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, fine tuning on BBox DocVQA substantially improves both bounding box localization and answer generation, validating its effectiveness for enhancing the reasoning ability of VLMs. Our dataset and code will be publicly released to advance research on interpretable and spatially grounded vision language reasoning.

TL;DR: This paper proposes CustNetGC, a novel model combining CNN with Custom Network Grad-CAM and CatBoost for Parkinson's disease diagnosis using voice recordings, achieving 99.06% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parkinson's disease is difficult to diagnose early, and vocal changes are key indicators. The paper aims to improve PD diagnosis using acoustic feature analysis from voice recordings.

Method: Used voice recordings from 81 participants (40 PD, 41 healthy controls), extracted L-mHP and Spectral Slopes features from spectrograms via HPSS, and developed CustNetGC model combining CNN, Grad-CAM for visualization, and CatBoost for classification.

Result: Achieved 99.06% accuracy, 95.83% precision, with AUC of 0.90 for PD class and 0.89 for HC class. CatBoost enhanced robustness and prediction performance.

Conclusion: CustNetGC shows potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and interpretability in Parkinson's disease prediction models using voice analysis.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that can be very tricky to diagnose and treat. Such early symptoms can include tremors, wheezy breathing, and changes in voice quality as critical indicators of neural damage. Notably, there has been growing interest in utilizing changes in vocal attributes as markers for the detection of PD early on. Based on this understanding, the present paper was designed to focus on the acoustic feature analysis based on voice recordings of patients diagnosed with PD and healthy controls (HC). In this paper, we introduce a novel classification and visualization model known as CustNetGC, combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Custom Network Grad-CAM and CatBoost to enhance the efficiency of PD diagnosis. We use a publicly available dataset from Figshare, including voice recordings of 81 participants: 40 patients with PD and 41 healthy controls. From these recordings, we extracted the key spectral features: L-mHP and Spectral Slopes. The L-mHP feature combines three spectrogram representations: Log-Mel spectrogram, harmonic spectrogram, and percussive spectrogram, which are derived using Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation (HPSS). Grad-CAM was used to highlight the important regions in the data, thus making the PD predictions interpretable and effective. Our proposed CustNetGC model achieved an accuracy of 99.06% and precision of 95.83%, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) recorded at 0.90 for the PD class and 0.89 for the HC class. Additionally, the combination of CatBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, enhanced the robustness and the prediction performance by properly classifying PD and non-PD samples. Therefore, the results provide the potential improvement in the CustNetGC system in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and the interpretability of the Parkinson's Disease prediction model.

*Senyu Fei,Siyin Wang,Li Ji,Ao Li,Shiduo Zhang,Liming Liu,Jinlong Hou,Jingjing Gong,Xianzhong Zhao,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SRPO is a novel VLA-RL framework that uses self-referential policy optimization to overcome reward sparsity by leveraging successful trajectories from current training batches as references for progress-wise rewards, eliminating the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models suffer from demonstration bias and limited performance due to heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, while existing VLA-RL methods face severe reward sparsity issues that waste valuable information from failed trajectories.

Method: SRPO uses the model's own successful trajectories as self-references to assign progress-wise rewards to failed attempts. It employs latent world representations from a world model's compressed encodings to measure behavioral progress robustly across environments without domain-specific fine-tuning.

Result: On the LIBERO benchmark, SRPO achieved 99.2% success rate from a 48.9% baseline in just 200 RL steps, representing 103% relative improvement. On LIBERO-Plus, it showed 167% performance improvement without extra supervision.

Conclusion: SRPO provides an efficient and effective solution to reward sparsity in VLA-RL, enabling substantial performance improvements through self-referential learning and generalized trajectory comparison using latent world representations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models excel in robotic manipulation but are constrained by their heavy reliance on expert demonstrations, leading to demonstration bias and limiting performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a vital post-training strategy to overcome these limits, yet current VLA-RL methods, including group-based optimization approaches, are crippled by severe reward sparsity. Relying on binary success indicators wastes valuable information in failed trajectories, resulting in low training efficiency. To solve this, we propose Self-Referential Policy Optimization (SRPO), a novel VLA-RL framework. SRPO eliminates the need for external demonstrations or manual reward engineering by leveraging the model's own successful trajectories, generated within the current training batch, as a self-reference. This allows us to assign a progress-wise reward to failed attempts. A core innovation is the use of latent world representations to measure behavioral progress robustly. Instead of relying on raw pixels or requiring domain-specific fine-tuning, we utilize the compressed, transferable encodings from a world model's latent space. These representations naturally capture progress patterns across environments, enabling accurate, generalized trajectory comparison. Empirical evaluations on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate SRPO's efficiency and effectiveness. Starting from a supervised baseline with 48.9% success, SRPO achieves a new state-of-the-art success rate of 99.2% in just 200 RL steps, representing a 103% relative improvement without any extra supervision. Furthermore, SRPO shows substantial robustness, achieving a 167% performance improvement on the LIBERO-Plus benchmark.

Result: The system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions, achieving strong environmental perception capabilities.

Conclusion: EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages embodied data and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks.

Abstract: In embodied AI perception systems, visual perception should be active: the goal is not to passively process static images, but to actively acquire more informative data within pixel and spatial budget constraints. Existing vision models and fixed RGB-D camera systems fundamentally fail to reconcile wide-area coverage with fine-grained detail acquisition, severely limiting their efficacy in open-world robotic applications. To address this issue, we propose EyeVLA, a robotic eyeball for active visual perception that can take proactive actions based on instructions, enabling clear observation of fine-grained target objects and detailed information across a wide spatial extent. EyeVLA discretizes action behaviors into action tokens and integrates them with vision-language models (VLMs) that possess strong open-world understanding capabilities, enabling joint modeling of vision, language, and actions within a single autoregressive sequence. By using the 2D bounding box coordinates to guide the reasoning chain and applying reinforcement learning to refine the viewpoint selection policy, we transfer the open-world scene understanding capability of the VLM to a vision language action (VLA) policy using only minimal real-world data. Experiments show that our system efficiently performs instructed scenes in real-world environments and actively acquires more accurate visual information through instruction-driven actions of rotation and zoom, thereby achieving strong environmental perception capabilities. EyeVLA introduces a novel robotic vision system that leverages detailed and spatially rich, large-scale embodied data, and actively acquires highly informative visual observations for downstream embodied tasks.

*Xiongyi Cai,Ri-Zhao Qiu,Geng Chen,Lai Wei,Isabella Liu,Tianshu Huang,Xuxin Cheng,Xiaolong Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The paper presents a scalable approach for using egocentric video data to learn manipulation policies, categorizing human data into in-the-wild and on-task types, and introduces a large dataset PHSD with over 1,000 hours of diverse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing approaches that use human data only for simple pre-training without unlocking its full potential for learning manipulation policies from egocentric videos.

Method: Categorizes human data into in-the-wild and on-task types, curates the PHSD dataset, learns a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy (Human0), and uses domain adaptation techniques to bridge the gap between humans and humanoids.

Result: Human0 achieves novel properties including language instruction following from only human data, few-shot learning capabilities, and improved robustness using on-task data.

Conclusion: The proposed scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data enables effective learning of manipulation policies with enhanced capabilities like language following and few-shot learning.

Abstract: Egocentric videos are a valuable and scalable data source to learn manipulation policies. However, due to significant data heterogeneity, most existing approaches utilize human data for simple pre-training, which does not unlock its full potential. This paper first provides a scalable recipe for collecting and using egocentric data by categorizing human data into two categories: in-the-wild and on-task alongside with systematic analysis on how to use the data. We first curate a dataset, PHSD, which contains over 1,000 hours of diverse in-the-wild egocentric data and over 20 hours of on-task data directly aligned to the target manipulation tasks. This enables learning a large egocentric language-conditioned flow matching policy, Human0. With domain adaptation techniques, Human0 minimizes the gap between humans and humanoids. Empirically, we show Human0 achieves several novel properties from scaling human data, including language following of instructions from only human data, few-shot learning, and improved robustness using on-task data.

### [158] [SkyEgg: Joint Implementation Selection and Scheduling for Hardware Synthesis using E-graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15323)
*Youwei Xiao,Yuyang Zou,Yun Liang*

Main category: cs.PL

TL;DR: SkyEgg is a hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using e-graphs, achieving 3.01x average speedup over Vitis HLS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HLS tools separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures due to inaccurate delay estimates and missed optimization opportunities.

Method: Constructs e-graph from input program, applies algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation, then formulates joint optimization as MILP problem on saturated e-graph with both exact solving and efficient ASAP heuristic.

Result: Achieves average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS on Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of implementation selection and scheduling using e-graphs enables superior hardware synthesis that better exploits FPGA heterogeneous architectures compared to traditional sequential approaches.

Abstract: Hardware synthesis from high-level descriptions remains fundamentally limited by the sequential optimization of interdependent design decisions. Current methodologies, including state-of-the-art high-level synthesis (HLS) tools, artificially separate implementation selection from scheduling, leading to suboptimal designs that cannot fully exploit modern FPGA heterogeneous architectures. Implementation selection is typically performed by ad-hoc pattern matching on operations, a process that does not consider the impact on scheduling. Subsequently, scheduling algorithms operate on fixed selection solutions with inaccurate delay estimates, which misses critical optimization opportunities from appropriately configured FPGA blocks like DSP slices.
  We present SkyEgg, a novel hardware synthesis framework that jointly optimizes implementation selection and scheduling using the e-graph data structure. Our key insight is that both algebraic transformations and hardware implementation choices can be uniformly represented as rewrite rules within an e-graph, modeling the complete design space of implementation candidates to be selected and scheduled together. First, SkyEgg constructs an e-graph from the input program. It then applies both algebraic and implementation rewrites through equality saturation. Finally, it formulates the joint optimization as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem on the saturated e-graph. We provide both exact MILP solving and an efficient ASAP heuristic for scalable synthesis. Our evaluation on benchmarks from diverse applications targeting Xilinx Kintex UltraScale+ FPGAs demonstrates that SkyEgg achieves an average speedup of 3.01x over Vitis HLS, with improvements up to 5.22x for complex expressions.
