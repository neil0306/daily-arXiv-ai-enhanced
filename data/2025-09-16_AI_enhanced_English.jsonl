This is an\nexpensive endeavor and is often infeasible, as model developers tend not to\nrelease their pre-training data. Naive approaches, such as continued\npretraining, suffer from catastrophic forgetting; however, mitigation\nstrategies like experience replay cannot be applied due to the lack of original\npretraining data. In this work, we investigate the problem of continually\nadding new languages to a multilingual model, assuming access to pretraining\ndata in only the target languages. We explore multiple approaches to address\nthis problem and propose Layer-Selective LoRA (LayRA), which adds Low-Rank\nAdapters (LoRA) to selected initial and final layers while keeping the rest of\nthe model frozen. LayRA builds on two insights: (1) LoRA reduces forgetting,\nand (2) multilingual models encode inputs in the source language in the initial\nlayers, reason in English in intermediate layers, and translate back to the\nsource language in final layers. We experiment with adding multiple\ncombinations of Galician, Swahili, and Urdu to pretrained language models and\nevaluate each method on diverse multilingual tasks. We find that LayRA provides\nthe overall best tradeoff between preserving models' capabilities in previously\nsupported languages, while being competitive with existing approaches such as\nLoRA in learning new languages.

We propose ROSGS,\na two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor\nscenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular\nnormal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact\n2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and\naccurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS\nthen decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting\nmodel. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing\na spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency\ncomponents of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via\nSpherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight\ncomprehensively. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative comparisons\ndemonstrate that ROSGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in relighting\noutdoor scenes and highlight its ability to deliver superior relighting\naccuracy and rendering efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "ROSGS is a two-stage pipeline that efficiently reconstructs relightable outdoor scenes using Gaussian Splatting representation, achieving superior relighting accuracy and rendering efficiency compared to previous NeRF and 3DGS approaches.", "motivation": "Outdoor scenes present challenges with unbounded environments and varying lighting conditions.

SpeCa's\ncore innovation lies in introducing Speculative Sampling to diffusion models,\npredicting intermediate features for subsequent timesteps based on fully\ncomputed reference timesteps. Our approach implements a parameter-free\nverification mechanism that efficiently evaluates prediction reliability,\nenabling real-time decisions to accept or reject each prediction while\nincurring negligible computational overhead. Furthermore, SpeCa introduces\nsample-adaptive computation allocation that dynamically modulates resources\nbased on generation complexity, allocating reduced computation for simpler\nsamples while preserving intensive processing for complex instances.\nExperiments demonstrate 6.34x acceleration on FLUX with minimal quality\ndegradation (5.5% drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT while preserving generation\nfidelity, and 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo. The\nverification mechanism incurs minimal overhead (1.67%-3.5% of full inference\ncosts), establishing a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference\nwhile maintaining generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios.\nOur codes have been released in Github:\n\\textbf{https://github.com/Shenyi-Z/Cache4Diffusion}", "AI": {"tldr": "SpeCa introduces speculative sampling to diffusion models, achieving 6-7x acceleration with minimal quality degradation through forecast-then-verify approach and adaptive computation allocation.", "motivation": "Diffusion models have high computational demands that prevent real-time applications due to strict temporal dependencies and intensive forward passes at each denoising step.", "method": "Uses speculative sampling inspired by LLMs, predicting intermediate features for future timesteps based on reference timesteps, with parameter-free verification and sample-adaptive computation allocation.", "result": "6.34x acceleration on FLUX (5.5% quality drop), 7.3x speedup on DiT with preserved fidelity, 79.84% VBench score at 6.1x acceleration for HunyuanVideo, with only 1.67%-3.5% verification overhead.", "conclusion": "Establishes a new paradigm for efficient diffusion model inference that maintains generation quality even at aggressive acceleration ratios through speculative sampling and adaptive computation."}}

ParaEQsA leverages a group\nmemory module shared among questions to reduce redundant exploration, and a\npriority-planning module to dynamically schedule questions. To evaluate this\nsetting, we contribute the Parallel Asynchronous Embodied Questions (PAEQs)\nbenchmark containing 40 indoor scenes and five questions per scene (200 in\ntotal), featuring asynchronous follow-up questions and urgency labels.
