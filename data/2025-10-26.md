### [1] [DeBERTa-KC: A Transformer-Based Classifier for Knowledge Construction in Online Learning Discourse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19858)
*Jindi Wang,Yidi Zhang,Zhaoxing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeBERTa-KC is a transformer model for classifying knowledge construction levels in online science discourse, achieving strong performance through advanced techniques like Focal Loss and R-Drop regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement in informal digital learning environments like YouTube science channels, enabling scalable analysis of knowledge construction processes.

Method: Extended DeBERTa-v3 with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class imbalance. Used 20,000 manually annotated samples from YouTube science channels across four KC categories, with 10-fold stratified cross-validation.

Result: Achieved macro-F1 of 0.836 ± 0.008, significantly outperforming classical and transformer baselines (p<0.01). Showed strong sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement in Explore and Negotiate categories.

Conclusion: Large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of knowledge construction in informal learning environments, offering scalable approaches for discourse analysis and automated assessment of epistemic engagement.

Abstract: This study presents DeBERTa-KC, a transformer-based model for automatic
classification of knowledge construction (KC) levels in online science learning
discourse. Using comments collected from four popular YouTube science channels
(2022--2024), a balanced corpus of 20,000 manually annotated samples was
created across four KC categories: \textit{nonKC}, \textit{Share},
\textit{Explore}, and \textit{Negotiate}. The proposed model extends DeBERTa-v3
with Focal Loss, Label Smoothing, and R-Drop regularization to address class
imbalance and enhance generalization. A reproducible end-to-end pipeline was
implemented, encompassing data extraction, annotation, preprocessing, training,
and evaluation. Across 10-fold stratified cross-validation, DeBERTa-KC achieved
a macro-F1 of $0.836 \pm 0.008$, significantly out-performing both classical
and transformer baselines ($p<0.01$). Per-category results indicate strong
sensitivity to higher-order epistemic engagement, particularly in
\textit{Explore} and \textit{Negotiate} discourse. These findings demonstrate
that large language models can effectively capture nuanced indicators of
knowledge construction in informal digital learning environments, offering
scalable, theory-informed approaches to discourse analysis and the development
of automated tools for assessing epistemic engagement.

### [2] [An Evaluation of the Pedagogical Soundness and Usability of AI-Generated Lesson Plans Across Different Models and Prompt Frameworks in High-School Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19866)
*Xincheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluates AI-generated lesson plans from five LLMs using three prompt frameworks, finding that model choice affects readability while prompt structure impacts factual accuracy and pedagogical completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated lesson plans across different large language models and prompt frameworks.

Method: Generated 15 lesson plans for high-school physics using five LLMs and three prompt frameworks, analyzed through four computational metrics: readability, factual accuracy, curriculum alignment, and cognitive demand.

Result: DeepSeek produced most readable plans, Claude generated densest language. RACE framework yielded best factual accuracy and curriculum alignment. Learning objectives clustered at lower Bloom's taxonomy levels across all models.

Conclusion: Readability is model-dependent while instructional reliability depends on prompt framework. Optimal approach combines readability-optimized model with RACE framework and explicit content/standards checklist.

Abstract: This study evaluates the pedagogical soundness and usability of AI-generated
lesson plans across five leading large language models: ChatGPT (GPT-5), Claude
Sonnet 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3.2, and Grok 4. Beyond model choice,
three structured prompt frameworks were tested: TAG (Task, Audience, Goal),
RACE (Role, Audience, Context, Execution), and COSTAR (Context, Objective,
Style, Tone, Audience, Response Format).
  Fifteen lesson plans were generated for a single high-school physics topic,
The Electromagnetic Spectrum. The lesson plans were analyzed through four
automated computational metrics: (1) readability and linguistic complexity, (2)
factual accuracy and hallucination detection, (3) standards and curriculum
alignment, and (4) cognitive demand of learning objectives.
  Results indicate that model selection exerted the strongest influence on
linguistic accessibility, with DeepSeek producing the most readable teaching
plan (FKGL = 8.64) and Claude generating the densest language (FKGL = 19.89).
  The prompt framework structure most strongly affected the factual accuracy
and pedagogical completeness, with the RACE framework yielding the lowest
hallucination index and the highest incidental alignment with NGSS curriculum
standards. Across all models, the learning objectives in the fifteen lesson
plans clustered at the Remember and Understand tiers of Bloom's taxonomy. There
were limited higher-order verbs in the learning objectives extracted.
  Overall, the findings suggest that readability is significantly governed by
model design, while instructional reliability and curricular alignment depend
more on the prompt framework. The most effective configuration for lesson plans
identified in the results was to combine a readability-optimized model with the
RACE framework and an explicit checklist of physics concepts, curriculum
standards, and higher-order objectives.

### [3] [From Denoising to Refining: A Corrective Framework for Vision-Language Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19871)
*Yatai Ji,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Zhiheng Liu,Sidi Yang,Ying Shan,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReDiff introduces a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that transforms discrete diffusion models from passive denoising to active error correction, breaking error cascades in parallel generation through self-correction training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models suffer from train-inference discrepancy where initial token errors during parallel decoding cause catastrophic error cascades, leading to syntactic errors and semantic hallucinations that hinder practical application.

Method: Two-stage training: 1) Foundational revision capability by training to revise synthetic errors; 2) Online self-correction loop where model learns to revise its own flawed drafts using expert corrections through mistake-driven learning.

Result: ReDiff significantly improves coherence and factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel generation far superior to traditional denoising methods.

Conclusion: The refining-enhanced diffusion framework effectively breaks error cascades by teaching models to identify and correct their own errors, making discrete diffusion models practically viable for vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a promising direction for
vision-language tasks, offering bidirectional context modeling and theoretical
parallelization. However, their practical application is severely hindered by a
train-inference discrepancy, which leads to catastrophic error cascades:
initial token errors during parallel decoding pollute the generation context,
triggering a chain reaction of compounding errors and leading to syntactic
errors and semantic hallucinations. To address this fundamental challenge, we
reframe the generation process from passive denoising to active refining. We
introduce ReDiff, a refining-enhanced diffusion framework that teaches the
model to identify and correct its own errors. Our approach features a two-stage
training process: first, we instill a foundational revision capability by
training the model to revise synthetic errors; second, we implement a novel
online self-correction loop where the model is explicitly trained to revise its
own flawed drafts by learning from an expert's corrections. This mistake-driven
learning endows the model with the crucial ability to revisit and refine its
already generated output, effectively breaking the error cascade. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ReDiff significantly improves the coherence and
factual accuracy of generated content, enabling stable and efficient parallel
generation far superior to traditional denoising methods. Our codes and models
are available at https://rediff-hku.github.io/.

### [4] [Stream: Scaling up Mechanistic Interpretability to Long Context in LLMs via Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19875)
*J Rosser,José Luis Redondo García,Gustavo Penha,Konstantina Palla,Hugues Bouchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sparse Tracing is a novel technique using dynamic sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns in LLMs, enabling interpretability at scale with near-linear time and linear space complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mechanistic interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale quadratically with context length, requiring terabytes of memory beyond 100,000 tokens, making long context analysis infeasible on consumer hardware.

Method: Introduces Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates per-head sparse attention masks using binary-search-style refinement to retain only top-k key blocks per query while preserving model's next-token behavior.

Result: Successfully applied to long chain-of-thought reasoning traces, identifying thought anchors while pruning 97-99% of token interactions. On RULER benchmark, preserves critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96% of interactions and exposes layer-wise routes from needle to output.

Conclusion: Sparse Tracing provides a practical drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow without requiring terabytes of caches, making long context interpretability feasible on consumer GPUs and democratizing chain-of-thought monitoring.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to million-token contexts, traditional
Mechanistic Interpretability techniques for analyzing attention scale
quadratically with context length, demanding terabytes of memory beyond 100,000
tokens. We introduce Sparse Tracing, a novel technique that leverages dynamic
sparse attention to efficiently analyze long context attention patterns. We
present Stream, a compilable hierarchical pruning algorithm that estimates
per-head sparse attention masks in near-linear time $O(T \log T)$ and linear
space $O(T)$, enabling one-pass interpretability at scale. Stream performs a
binary-search-style refinement to retain only the top-$k$ key blocks per query
while preserving the model's next-token behavior. We apply Stream to long
chain-of-thought reasoning traces and identify thought anchors while pruning
97-99\% of token interactions. On the RULER benchmark, Stream preserves
critical retrieval paths while discarding 90-96\% of interactions and exposes
layer-wise routes from the needle to output. Our method offers a practical
drop-in tool for analyzing attention patterns and tracing information flow
without terabytes of caches. By making long context interpretability feasible
on consumer GPUs, Sparse Tracing helps democratize chain-of-thought monitoring.

### [5] [Automated HIV Screening on Dutch EHR with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19879)
*Lang Zhou,Amrish Jhingoer,Yinghao Luo,Klaske Vliegenthart--Jongbloed,Carlijn Jordans,Ben Werkhoven,Tom Seinen,Erik van Mulligen,Casper Rokx,Yunlei Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel pipeline using LLMs to analyze unstructured EHR text for HIV testing eligibility screening, achieving high accuracy and low false negative rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HIV screening methods mainly use structured EHR data, overlooking valuable information in unstructured clinical notes. EHR adoption creates opportunities to improve HIV diagnosis through text analysis.

Method: Proposed a pipeline leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze unstructured EHR text data to determine patient eligibility for HIV testing.

Result: Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam showed high accuracy and low false negative rate.

Conclusion: The LLM-based pipeline effectively utilizes unstructured EHR text for HIV screening, providing an accurate approach for identifying patients needing further testing.

Abstract: Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing
onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible,
the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new
opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on
applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient
demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often
overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially
contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze
unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV
testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical
Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while
maintaining a low false negative rate.

### [6] [An Expert-grounded benchmark of General Purpose LLMs in LCA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19886)
*Artur Donaldson,Bharathan Balaji,Cajetan Oriekezie,Manish Kumar,Laure Patouillard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First expert-grounded benchmark of LLMs in life cycle assessment (LCA) shows 37% of responses contain inaccurate information, with hallucination rates up to 40%, but open-weight models compete with closed-weight models on accuracy and explanation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks for LLMs in LCA, where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist, despite increasing exploration of AI tools in this field.

Method: Evaluated 11 general-purpose LLMs across 22 LCA-related tasks with 17 experienced practitioners reviewing model outputs against criteria including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness, verifiability, and adherence to instructions (168 expert reviews total).

Result: 37% of responses contained inaccurate/misleading information; hallucination rates varied significantly (up to 40% for citations); no clear distinction between open-weight vs closed-weight models - open-weight models performed comparably or better on accuracy and explanation quality.

Conclusion: Highlights risks of naive LLM application in LCA (treating as oracles) but shows benefits for explanation quality and reducing labor intensity of simple tasks; warns against using general-purpose LLMs without grounding mechanisms.

Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular large language
models (LLMs), are increasingly being explored as tools to support life cycle
assessment (LCA). While demonstrations exist across environmental and social
domains, systematic evidence on their reliability, robustness, and usability
remains limited. This study provides the first expert-grounded benchmark of
LLMs in LCA, addressing the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks in a
field where no clear ground truth or consensus protocols exist.
  Methods: We evaluated eleven general-purpose LLMs, spanning both commercial
and open-source families, across 22 LCA-related tasks. Seventeen experienced
practitioners reviewed model outputs against criteria directly relevant to LCA
practice, including scientific accuracy, explanation quality, robustness,
verifiability, and adherence to instructions. We collected 168 expert reviews.
  Results: Experts judged 37% of responses to contain inaccurate or misleading
information. Ratings of accuracy and quality of explanation were generally
rated average or good on many models even smaller models, and format adherence
was generally rated favourably. Hallucination rates varied significantly, with
some models producing hallucinated citations at rates of up to 40%. There was
no clear-cut distinction between ratings on open-weight versus closed-weight
LLMs, with open-weight models outperforming or competing on par with
closed-weight models on criteria such as accuracy and quality of explanation.
  Conclusion: These findings highlight the risks of applying LLMs na\"ively in
LCA, such as when LLMs are treated as free-form oracles, while also showing
benefits especially around quality of explanation and alleviating labour
intensiveness of simple tasks. The use of general-purpose LLMs without
grounding mechanisms presents ...

### [7] [Can They Dixit? Yes they Can! Dixit as a Playground for Multimodal Language Model Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19892)
*Nishant Balepur,Dang Nguyen,Dayeon Ki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using game-based evaluations (specifically Dixit) to holistically assess multi-modal large language models, addressing limitations of static benchmarks and subjective pairwise comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLM evaluation methods are problematic - static benchmarks can't assess multiple capabilities simultaneously, while pairwise comparisons are subjective, expensive, and allow models to exploit shortcuts like verbosity.

Method: Use game-based evaluations through Dixit, a fantasy card game where players generate captions that trick some but not all players into selecting the played card. This requires multiple abilities and has fixed, objective rules.

Result: Experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings perfectly correlate with popular MLM benchmarks. Games between humans and MLMs reveal differences in strategies and areas for MLM reasoning improvement.

Conclusion: Game-based evaluations provide a robust, holistic framework for assessing MLM capabilities that addresses current evaluation challenges and reveals important insights about model reasoning and strategies.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLMs) are often assessed on static,
individual benchmarks -- which cannot jointly assess MLM capabilities in a
single task -- or rely on human or model pairwise comparisons -- which is
highly subjective, expensive, and allows models to exploit superficial
shortcuts (e.g., verbosity) to inflate their win-rates. To overcome these
issues, we propose game-based evaluations to holistically assess MLM
capabilities. Games require multiple abilities for players to win, are
inherently competitive, and are governed by fix, objective rules, and makes
evaluation more engaging, providing a robust framework to address the
aforementioned challenges. We manifest this evaluation specifically through
Dixit, a fantasy card game where players must generate captions for a card that
trick some, but not all players, into selecting the played card. Our
quantitative experiments with five MLMs show Dixit win-rate rankings are
perfectly correlated with those on popular MLM benchmarks, while games between
human and MLM players in Dixit reveal several differences between agent
strategies and areas of improvement for MLM reasoning.

### [8] [Large Language Model enabled Mathematical Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19895)
*Guoyun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates DeepSeek-R1 LLM for optimization modeling in operations research, addressing the formulation gap between natural language problems and mathematical models through systematic benchmarking and hallucination mitigation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional optimization methods require extensive domain expertise for mathematical formulation, while existing LLMs have high costs and hallucination issues. DeepSeek-R1 offers a cost-efficient alternative but its effectiveness in applied OR scenarios is under explored.

Method: Systematic evaluation across four OR benchmarks (NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, ComplexOR) using baseline assessments, hallucination taxonomy development, and mitigation strategies including LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning, Tool Calling, and Multi-agent Framework.

Result: The study demonstrates DeepSeek-R1's potential as a viable alternative to expensive LLMs for OR applications, with improved formulation accuracy and reduced hallucinations through the applied mitigation techniques.

Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 shows promise in bridging the formulation gap in optimization modeling, offering a cost-effective solution for translating real-world problems into mathematical models with reduced hallucinations and better alignment with user intent.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with optimization modeling
offers a promising avenue for advancing decision-making in operations research
(OR). Traditional optimization methods,such as linear programming, mixed
integer programming, and simulation depend heavily on domain expertise to
translate real-world problems into solvable mathematical models. While solvers
like Gurobi and COPT are powerful, expert input remains essential for defining
objectives, constraints, and variables. This research investigates the
potential of LLMs, specifically the DeepSeek-R1 model, to bridge this
formulation gap using natural language understanding and code generation.
Although prior models like GPT-4, Claude, and Bard have shown strong
performance in NLP and reasoning tasks, their high token costs and tendency
toward hallucinations limit real-world applicability in supply chain contexts.
In contrast, DeepSeek-R1, a cost-efficient and high-performing model trained
with reinforcement learning, presents a viable alternative. Despite its success
in benchmarks such as LiveCodeBench and Math-500, its effectiveness in applied
OR scenarios remains under explored. This study systematically evaluates
DeepSeek-R1 across four key OR benchmarks: NL4OPT, IndustryOR, EasyLP, and
ComplexOR. Our methodology includes baseline assessments, the development of a
hallucination taxonomy, and the application of mitigation strategies like
LLM-as-a-Judge, Few-shot Learning (FSL), Tool Calling, and a Multi-agent
Framework. These techniques aim to reduce hallucinations, enhance formulation
accuracy, and better align model outputs with user intent.

### [9] [Learning from Supervision with Semantic and Episodic Memory: A Reflective Approach to Agent Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19897)
*Jackson Hassell,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Tom Mitchell,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A memory-augmented framework using LLM-generated critiques improves classification accuracy by up to 24.8% over RAG baselines, with distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable LLM agents to learn classification functions without costly fine-tuning, addressing limitations of conventional approaches that are expensive, inflexible, and opaque.

Method: Proposes a dual-memory framework with episodic memory for instance-level critiques and semantic memory for task-level guidance, using LLM-generated critiques alongside labeled data.

Result: Achieves up to 24.8% accuracy improvement over retrieval-based baselines, with notable differences in how OpenAI vs open-source models handle fact-oriented vs preference-based data.

Conclusion: Memory-driven reflective learning shows promise for building more adaptive and interpretable LLM agents, with the suggestibility metric helping explain model behaviors.

Abstract: We investigate how agents built on pretrained large language models can learn
target classification functions from labeled examples without parameter
updates. While conventional approaches like fine-tuning are often costly,
inflexible, and opaque, we propose a memory-augmented framework that leverages
both labeled data and LLM-generated critiques. Our framework uses episodic
memory to store instance-level critiques-capturing specific past
experiences-and semantic memory to distill these into reusable, task-level
guidance. Across a diverse set of tasks, incorporating critiques yields up to a
24.8 percent accuracy improvement over retrieval-based (RAG-style) baselines
that rely only on labels. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we uncover
distinct behavioral differences between OpenAI and opensource models,
particularly in how they handle fact-oriented versus preference-based data. To
interpret how models respond to different representations of supervision
encoded in memory, we introduce a novel metric, suggestibility. This helps
explain observed behaviors and illuminates how model characteristics and memory
strategies jointly shape learning dynamics. Our findings highlight the promise
of memory-driven, reflective learning for building more adaptive and
interpretable LLM agents.

### [10] [LyriCAR: A Difficulty-Aware Curriculum Reinforcement Learning Framework For Controllable Lyric Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19967)
*Le Ren,Xiangjian Zeng,Qingqiang Wu,Ruoxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LyriCAR is an unsupervised framework for controllable lyric translation that uses difficulty-aware curriculum learning to improve translation quality while reducing training steps by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing lyric translation methods rely on hand-crafted rules and sentence-level modeling, limiting their ability to handle musical-linguistic patterns and paragraph-level coherence with global rhyme.

Method: LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware curriculum designer and adaptive curriculum strategy that guides the model through increasingly complex challenges for efficient training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on EN-ZH lyric translation across standard metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, with 40% reduction in training steps while maintaining superior performance.

Conclusion: LyriCAR provides an effective unsupervised framework for lyric translation that handles musical constraints and improves training efficiency through curriculum learning.

Abstract: Lyric translation is a challenging task that requires balancing multiple
musical constraints. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules and
sentence-level modeling, which restrict their ability to internalize
musical-linguistic patterns and to generalize effectively at the paragraph
level, where cross-line coherence and global rhyme are crucial. In this work,
we propose LyriCAR, a novel framework for controllable lyric translation that
operates in a fully unsupervised manner. LyriCAR introduces a difficulty-aware
curriculum designer and an adaptive curriculum strategy, ensuring efficient
allocation of training resources, accelerating convergence, and improving
overall translation quality by guiding the model with increasingly complex
challenges. Extensive experiments on the EN-ZH lyric translation task show that
LyriCAR achieves state-of-the-art results across both standard translation
metrics and multi-dimensional reward scores, surpassing strong baselines.
Notably, the adaptive curriculum strategy reduces training steps by nearly 40%
while maintaining superior performance. Code, data and model can be accessed at

### [11] [LLM-Augmented Symbolic NLU System for More Reliable Continuous Causal Statement Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19988)
*Xin Lian,Kenneth D. Forbus*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combining LLMs' broad coverage with symbolic NLU's structured representations improves accuracy in extracting quantities and causal laws from science texts, outperforming symbolic-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from hallucination and inconsistent outputs, while symbolic NLU systems provide interpretable structured representations but have limited coverage and require specialized skills to maintain.

Method: Integrate LLMs for rephrasing, text simplification, and knowledge gap filling with symbolic NLU for producing structured relational representations suitable for reasoning and incremental learning.

Result: The hybrid method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline in extracting and interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts.

Conclusion: Combining LLMs' broad coverage with symbolic NLU's structured representations offers a promising approach that leverages the strengths of both methods while mitigating their individual weaknesses.

Abstract: Despite the broad applicability of large language models (LLMs), their
reliance on probabilistic inference makes them vulnerable to errors such as
hallucination in generated facts and inconsistent output structure in natural
language understanding (NLU) tasks. By contrast, symbolic NLU systems provide
interpretable understanding grounded in curated lexicons, semantic resources,
and syntactic & semantic interpretation rules. They produce relational
representations that can be used for accurate reasoning and planning, as well
as incremental debuggable learning. However, symbolic NLU systems tend to be
more limited in coverage than LLMs and require scarce knowledge representation
and linguistics skills to extend and maintain. This paper explores a hybrid
approach that integrates the broad-coverage language processing of LLMs with
the symbolic NLU capabilities of producing structured relational
representations to hopefully get the best of both approaches. We use LLMs for
rephrasing and text simplification, to provide broad coverage, and as a source
of information to fill in knowledge gaps more automatically. We use symbolic
NLU to produce representations that can be used for reasoning and for
incremental learning. We evaluate this approach on the task of extracting and
interpreting quantities and causal laws from commonsense science texts, along
with symbolic- and LLM-only pipelines. Our results suggest that our hybrid
method works significantly better than the symbolic-only pipeline.

### [12] [A Fundamental Algorithm for Dependency Parsing (With Corrections)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19996)
*Michael A. Covington*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A fundamental dependency parsing algorithm that processes sentences word by word, attaching each word immediately when possible, mimicking human brain parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a parsing algorithm that operates similarly to human brain parsing by processing words incrementally and attaching them as soon as possible, unlike traditional phrase-structure parsers.

Method: The algorithm parses natural language sentences into dependency trees by processing one word at a time and attaching each word immediately when it can be attached, with worst-case complexity of O(n³).

Result: The algorithm successfully parses sentences into dependency trees with O(n³) worst-case complexity, though in human language this worst case only occurs for small n.

Conclusion: This dependency parsing algorithm provides an efficient approach that mimics human brain parsing behavior while maintaining manageable computational complexity for natural language processing.

Abstract: This paper presents a fundamental algorithm for parsing natural language
sentences into dependency trees. Unlike phrase-structure (constituency)
parsers, this algorithm operates one word at a time, attaching each word as
soon as it can be attached, corresponding to properties claimed for the parser
in the human brain. Like phrase-structure parsing, its worst-case complexity is
$O(n^3)$, but in human language, the worst case occurs only for small $n$.

### [13] [Beyond MedQA: Towards Real-world Clinical Decision Making in the Era of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20001)
*Yunpeng Xiao,Carl Yang,Mark Mai,Xiao Hu,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a unifying paradigm to evaluate LLMs for clinical decision-making by characterizing tasks along Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions dimensions, showing that difficulty increases as these approach real clinical environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical datasets like MedQA rely on simplified Q&A that underrepresents real-world clinical decision-making, creating a gap between LLM evaluation and actual clinical practice.

Method: Proposes a two-dimensional framework (Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions) to characterize clinical decision-making tasks, reviews existing datasets along these dimensions, and analyzes training-time and test-time techniques for improving LLM performance.

Result: The paradigm helps clarify assumptions, standardize comparisons between methods, and provides guidance for developing clinically meaningful LLMs by extending evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency and explainability.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a systematic approach to evaluate and develop LLMs for clinical use, addressing the limitations of current simplified datasets and providing direction for future research in clinically meaningful AI applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for clinical use. They are often
evaluated using datasets such as MedQA. However, Many medical datasets, such as
MedQA, rely on simplified Question-Answering (Q\A) that underrepresents
real-world clinical decision-making. Based on this, we propose a unifying
paradigm that characterizes clinical decision-making tasks along two
dimensions: Clinical Backgrounds and Clinical Questions. As the background and
questions approach the real clinical environment, the difficulty increases. We
summarize the settings of existing datasets and benchmarks along two
dimensions. Then we review methods to address clinical decision-making,
including training-time and test-time techniques, and summarize when they help.
Next, we extend evaluation beyond accuracy to include efficiency,
explainability. Finally, we highlight open challenges. Our paradigm clarifies
assumptions, standardizes comparisons, and guides the development of clinically
meaningful LLMs.

### [14] [Forging GEMs: Advancing Greek NLP through Quality-Based Corpus Curation and Specialized Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20002)
*Alexandra Apostolopoulou,Konstantinos Kanaris,Athanasios Koursaris,Dimitris Tsakalidis,George Domalis,Ioannis E. Livieris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Greek Embedding Models (GEM), a new family of transformer models for Greek language that address limitations in existing models through extensive data curation and diverse modern architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advance NLP for morphologically rich languages like Greek, particularly in specialized domains like law, where current models have fragmented research, limited architectural diversity, and restrictive 512-token context windows insufficient for legal documents.

Method: Constructed large-scale Greek corpora with rigorous quality-based filtering, pre-trained diverse modern architectures (ELECTRA, ConvBERT, ModernBERT), and created the first bilingual Greek-English legal domain embedding models.

Result: GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models significantly outperform existing baselines on downstream tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The new class of Greek Embedding Models successfully addresses previous limitations and establishes improved performance for Greek language processing, particularly in specialized domains.

Abstract: The advancement of natural language processing for morphologically rich,
moderately-resourced languages like Modern Greek is often hindered by a
fragmented research landscape, a lack of architectural diversity and reliance
on limited context-length models. This is particularly true in specialized,
high-value domains such as law, where existing models are frequently confined
to early transformer architectures with a restrictive 512-token window,
insufficient for analyzing long legal documents. To address these challenges,
this paper presents Greek Embedding Models, a new family of transformer models
for Greek language built upon a foundation of extensive, quality-driven data
curation. We detail the construction of several large-scale Greek corpora,
emphasizing a rigorous, quality-based filtering and preprocessing methodology
to create high-value training datasets from both general-domain and specialized
legal sources. On this carefully curated foundation, we pre-train and
systematically evaluate a diverse suite of modern architectures, which has not
previously applied to Greek language, such as ELECTRA, ConvBERT and ModernBERT.
Furthermore, we propose the first bilingual Greek-English Embedding Models
tailored for the legal domain. The extensive experiments on downstream tasks
demonstrate that the new class of models establish the effectiveness of the
proposed approach, highlighting that the GEM-RoBERTa and GEM-ConvBERT models
significantly outperform existing baselines.

*David Dukić*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This thesis improves transfer learning for sequence labeling by proposing three approaches: multi-task learning with additional signals, architectural modifications for bidirectional flow in autoregressive models, and supervised in-context fine-tuning with response-oriented adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the performance of pre-trained neural language models on sequence labeling tasks through targeted transfer learning adaptations, addressing limitations in domain transfer and model architecture.

Method: Three main approaches: 1) Multi-task model incorporating domain-independent signals for event trigger detection, 2) Architectural modifications enabling bidirectional information flow in autoregressive LLMs, 3) Generative supervised in-context fine-tuning framework with response-oriented adaptation strategies.

Result: The proposed model, method, and framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted transfer learning paradigms.

Conclusion: Pre-trained neural language models perform optimally on sequence labeling tasks when specifically adapted through targeted transfer learning approaches that address domain transfer, architectural limitations, and fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: This doctoral thesis improves the transfer learning for sequence labeling
tasks by adapting pre-trained neural language models. The proposed improvements
in transfer learning involve introducing a multi-task model that incorporates
an additional signal, a method based on architectural modifications in
autoregressive large language models, and a sequence labeling framework for
autoregressive large language models utilizing supervised in-context
fine-tuning combined with response-oriented adaptation strategies. The first
improvement is given in the context of domain transfer for the event trigger
detection task. The domain transfer of the event trigger detection task can be
improved by incorporating an additional signal obtained from a
domain-independent text processing system into a multi-task model. The second
improvement involves modifying the model's architecture. For that purpose, a
method is proposed to enable bidirectional information flow across layers of
autoregressive large language models. The third improvement utilizes
autoregressive large language models as text generators through a generative
supervised in-context fine-tuning framework. The proposed model, method, and
framework demonstrate that pre-trained neural language models achieve their
best performance on sequence labeling tasks when adapted through targeted
transfer learning paradigms.

*Marianne Menglin Liu,Daniel Garcia,Fjona Parllaku,Vikas Upadhyay,Syed Fahad Allam Shah,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolScope improves LLM tool selection by merging redundant tools and retrieving relevant ones, achieving 8.38%-38.6% accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents face ambiguity from redundant tools with overlapping names/descriptions and context limits that prevent efficient consideration of large toolsets.

Method: ToolScope includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to audit and fix tool merges, reducing redundancy; (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit context limits.

Result: Evaluations on three state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of 8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy.

Conclusion: ToolScope effectively enhances LLM tool use by addressing tool redundancy and context limitations while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents rely on external tools to solve complex
tasks, but real-world toolsets often contain redundant tools with overlapping
names and descriptions, introducing ambiguity and reducing selection accuracy.
LLMs also face strict input context limits, preventing efficient consideration
of large toolsets. To address these challenges, we propose ToolScope, which
includes: (1) ToolScopeMerger with Auto-Correction to automatically audit and
fix tool merges, reducing redundancy, and (2) ToolScopeRetriever to rank and
select only the most relevant tools for each query, compressing toolsets to fit
within context limits without sacrificing accuracy. Evaluations on three
state-of-the-art LLMs and three open-source tool-use benchmarks show gains of
8.38% to 38.6% in tool selection accuracy, demonstrating ToolScope's
effectiveness in enhancing LLM tool use.

TL;DR: BLanCK dataset addresses gaps in evaluating cultural knowledge of LLMs for Bengali language, showing models struggle with cultural nuances despite good performance on non-cultural tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent multilingual benchmarks fail to capture nuances of low-resource cultures, particularly Bengali cultural knowledge including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional dialects.

Method: Created Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge (BLanCK) dataset and evaluated several multilingual language models on cultural vs non-cultural categories.

Result: Models performed well on non-cultural categories but struggled significantly with cultural knowledge. Performance improved substantially across all models when context was provided.

Conclusion: Emphasizes the need for context-aware architectures and culturally curated training data to improve LLM performance on cultural knowledge tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in NLP research has demonstrated remarkable capabilities of
large language models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. While recent
multilingual benchmarks have advanced cultural evaluation for LLMs, critical
gaps remain in capturing the nuances of low-resource cultures. Our work
addresses these limitations through a Bengali Language Cultural Knowledge
(BLanCK) dataset including folk traditions, culinary arts, and regional
dialects. Our investigation of several multilingual language models shows that
while these models perform well in non-cultural categories, they struggle
significantly with cultural knowledge and performance improves substantially
across all models when context is provided, emphasizing context-aware
architectures and culturally curated training data.

*Mehrdad Ghassabi,Sadra Hakim,Hamidreza Baradaran Kashani,Pedram Rostami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using RLAIF and DPO to enhance Persian medical reasoning in small language models with limited data, achieving superior performance over larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving reasoning capabilities in small language models for specialized applications like medical QA in underrepresented languages like Persian, where data is limited.

Method: Translated medical QA dataset to Persian, used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs with CoT reasoning, applied DPO training on a 4.5M token dataset.

Result: Model outperformed gaokerena-V (trained on 57M tokens) despite using much smaller dataset (4.5M tokens), showing significant medical reasoning improvement.

Conclusion: Reasoning-focused training approaches are efficient and effective for developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for
specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in
underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement
Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to
improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To
achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering
dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer
pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and
student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we
compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories.
This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million
tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly
enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the
resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on
approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset.
These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused
training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited
data availability.

*Zhaoyi Joey Hou,Bowei Alvin Zhang,Yining Lu,Bhiman Kumar Baghel,Anneliese Brei,Ximing Lu,Meng Jiang,Faeze Brahman,Snigdha Chaturvedi,Haw-Shiuan Chang,Daniel Khashabi,Xiang Lorraine Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CreativityPrism is a holistic framework that evaluates LLM creativity across three dimensions (quality, novelty, diversity) using nine tasks across three domains (divergent thinking, creative writing, logical reasoning) with 20 metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no comprehensive framework to evaluate LLM creativity across diverse scenarios, as existing methods are fragmented with varying definitions and measurements of creativity across domains and tasks.

Method: Proposed CreativityPrism framework that decomposes creativity into quality, novelty, and diversity dimensions. Evaluated 17 SoTA proprietary and open-source LLMs using 9 tasks across 3 domains with 20 evaluation metrics.

Result: Found notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models. Model performance correlates strongly within same domains but weakly across different domains. Diversity and quality metrics show strong correlation, while novelty exhibits weak correlation with either.

Conclusion: Strong performance in one creativity task or dimension doesn't necessarily generalize to others, highlighting the need for holistic evaluation of LLM creativity rather than relying on single metrics or domains.

Abstract: Creativity is often seen as a hallmark of human intelligence. While large
language models (LLMs) are increasingly perceived as producing creative text,
there is still no holistic framework to evaluate their creativity across
diverse scenarios. Existing evaluation methods remain fragmented, with dramatic
variation across domains and tasks, largely due to differing definitions and
measurements of creativity. Inspired by the hypothesis that creativity is not
one fixed idea, we propose CreativityPrism, an evaluation analysis framework
that decomposes creativity into three dimensions: quality, novelty, and
diversity. CreativityPrism incorporates nine tasks, three domains, i.e.,
divergent thinking, creative writing, and logical reasoning, and twenty
evaluation metrics, which measure each dimension in task-specific, unique ways.
We evaluate 17 state-of-the-art (SoTA) proprietary and open-sourced LLMs on
CreativityPrism and analyze the performance correlations among different
metrics and task domains. Our results reveal a notable gap between proprietary
and open-source models. Overall, model performance tends to be highly
correlated across tasks within the same domain and less so across different
domains. Among evaluation dimensions, diversity and quality metrics show strong
correlations - models that perform well on one often excel on the other -
whereas novelty exhibits much weaker correlation with either. These findings
support our hypothesis that strong performance in one creativity task or
dimension does not necessarily generalize to others, underscoring the need for
a holistic evaluation of LLM creativity.

*Yajie Li,Albert Galimov,Mitra Datta Ganapaneni,Pujitha Thejaswi,De Meng,Priyanshu Kumar,Saloni Potdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARTER is a structured pipeline for Entity Linking that combines candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and selective reasoning to achieve high performance without deep fine-tuning, while being twice as efficient as full LLM-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Entity Linking requires large annotated datasets and extensive model fine-tuning, while recent few-shot methods using LLMs are inefficient due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER aims to reduce computational costs while maintaining high performance.

Method: ARTER uses a structured pipeline that computes complementary signals (embedding and LLM-based) over retrieved candidates to categorize mentions into easy and hard cases. Easy cases are handled by low-computational entity linkers like ReFinED, while hard cases use targeted LLM-based reasoning.

Result: On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms ReFinED by up to +4.47% with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets. It performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all mentions while being twice as efficient in terms of LLM token usage.

Conclusion: ARTER demonstrates that strategic combination of different reasoning approaches through adaptive routing can achieve state-of-the-art Entity Linking performance while significantly reducing computational costs compared to full LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Entity Linking (EL) has traditionally relied on large annotated datasets and
extensive model fine-tuning. While recent few-shot methods leverage large
language models (LLMs) through prompting to reduce training requirements, they
often suffer from inefficiencies due to expensive LLM-based reasoning. ARTER
(Adaptive Routing and Targeted Entity Reasoning) presents a structured pipeline
that achieves high performance without deep fine-tuning by strategically
combining candidate generation, context-based scoring, adaptive routing, and
selective reasoning. ARTER computes a small set of complementary signals(both
embedding and LLM-based) over the retrieved candidates to categorize contextual
mentions into easy and hard cases. The cases are then handled by a
low-computational entity linker (e.g. ReFinED) and more expensive targeted
LLM-based reasoning respectively. On standard benchmarks, ARTER outperforms
ReFinED by up to +4.47%, with an average gain of +2.53% on 5 out of 6 datasets,
and performs comparably to pipelines using LLM-based reasoning for all
mentions, while being as twice as efficient in terms of the number of LLM
tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BoundRL is an efficient approach for segmenting complex structured texts by generating only starting tokens and reconstructing segments from original text, using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to optimize reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional text segmentation methods fail to handle complex structured texts containing tables, code snippets, and placeholders, creating a need for more effective segmentation approaches for diverse domains including technical reports and AI prompts.

Method: BoundRL performs joint token-level text segmentation and label prediction by generating starting tokens and reconstructing segments from original text. It uses reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) with a reward function optimizing document reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment, and employs intermediate candidate generation by perturbing segments to prevent entropy collapse.

Result: BoundRL enables small language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of larger models. RLVR with the designed reward significantly improves over supervised fine-tuning, and intermediate candidate generation further enhances both performance and generalization.

Conclusion: BoundRL provides an efficient and effective solution for segmenting complex structured texts, demonstrating superior performance with small models through its novel reinforcement learning approach and intermediate candidate strategy.

Abstract: As structured texts become increasingly complex across diverse domains --
from technical reports to generative AI prompts -- the need for text
segmentation into semantically meaningful components becomes critical. Such
texts often contain elements beyond plain language, including tables, code
snippets, and placeholders, which conventional sentence- or paragraph-level
segmentation methods cannot handle effectively. To address this challenge, we
propose BoundRL, a novel and efficient approach that jointly performs
token-level text segmentation and label prediction for long structured texts.
Instead of generating complete contents for each segment, it generates only a
sequence of starting tokens and reconstructs the complete contents by locating
these tokens within the original texts, thereby reducing inference costs by
orders of magnitude and minimizing hallucination. To adapt the model for the
output format, BoundRL~performs reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) with a specifically designed reward that jointly optimizes document
reconstruction fidelity and semantic alignment. To mitigate entropy collapse,
it further constructs intermediate candidates by systematically perturbing a
fraction of generated sequences of segments to create stepping stones toward
higher-quality solutions. To demonstrate BoundRL's effectiveness on
particularly challenging structured texts, we focus evaluation on complex
prompts used for LLM applications. Experiments show that BoundRL enables small
language models (1.7B parameters) to outperform few-shot prompting of much
larger models. Moreover, RLVR with our designed reward yields significant
improvements over supervised fine-tuning, and incorporating intermediate
candidates further improves both performance and generalization.

*Anthony Dubreuil,Antoine Gourru,Christine Largeron,Amine Trabelsi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, associating certain dialects and text complexity levels with specific political stances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate bias in Large Language Models when performing stance detection in zero-shot settings, as this sensitive NLP task has been largely overlooked despite its political implications.

Method: Automatically annotate posts in existing stance detection datasets with dialect/vernacular and text complexity attributes to investigate their influence on model decisions.

Result: LLMs show significant stereotypes, such as incorrectly associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

Conclusion: Large Language Models inherit and exhibit stereotypes from their pretraining data in stance detection tasks, revealing systematic biases that need to be addressed.

Abstract: Large Language Models inherit stereotypes from their pretraining data,
leading to biased behavior toward certain social groups in many Natural
Language Processing tasks, such as hateful speech detection or sentiment
analysis. Surprisingly, the evaluation of this kind of bias in stance detection
methods has been largely overlooked by the community. Stance Detection involves
labeling a statement as being against, in favor, or neutral towards a specific
target and is among the most sensitive NLP tasks, as it often relates to
political leanings. In this paper, we focus on the bias of Large Language
Models when performing stance detection in a zero-shot setting. We
automatically annotate posts in pre-existing stance detection datasets with two
attributes: dialect or vernacular of a specific group and text
complexity/readability, to investigate whether these attributes influence the
model's stance detection decisions. Our results show that LLMs exhibit
significant stereotypes in stance detection tasks, such as incorrectly
associating pro-marijuana views with low text complexity and African American
dialect with opposition to Donald Trump.

TL;DR: DeepWideSearch is a new benchmark that evaluates agents' ability to combine deep multi-hop reasoning with wide-scale information collection, revealing major limitations in current search agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search agents lack the ability to simultaneously perform deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and wide-scale information collection, which is critical for real-world applications like market analysis and business development.

Method: Proposed two methods to convert established datasets, creating a curated collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains that require both deep reasoning and wide information gathering.

Result: State-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of integrating depth and width search. Error analysis reveals four key failure modes.

Conclusion: DeepWideSearch exposes critical limitations in current agent architectures and is released publicly to catalyze research on more capable information-seeking agents.

Abstract: Current search agents fundamentally lack the ability to simultaneously
perform \textit{deep} reasoning over multi-hop retrieval and
\textit{wide}-scale information collection-a critical deficiency for real-world
applications like comprehensive market analysis and business development. To
bridge this gap, we introduce DeepWideSearch, the first benchmark explicitly
designed to evaluate agents to integrate depth and width in information
seeking. In DeepWideSearch, agents must process a large volume of data, each
requiring deep reasoning over multi-hop retrieval paths. Specifically, we
propose two methods to converse established datasets, resulting in a curated
collection of 220 questions spanning 15 diverse domains. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art agents achieve only 2.39% average
success rate on DeepWideSearch, highlighting the substantial challenge of
integrating depth and width search in information-seeking tasks. Furthermore,
our error analysis reveals four failure modes: lack of reflection, overreliance
on internal knowledge, insufficient retrieval, and context overflow-exposing
key limitations in current agent architectures. We publicly release
DeepWideSearch to catalyze future research on more capable and robust
information-seeking agents.

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Minds is a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into planning, coding, and answering roles, using code execution for precise table manipulation and self-improvement via MCTS and RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for table reasoning have limitations: fine-tuning methods suffer from arithmetic errors and hallucination, while tool-based methods lack semantic understanding and rely on rigid schemas.

Method: A multi-agent framework with three specialized roles (planning, coding, answering) that uses code execution for table manipulation and employs MCTS rollouts for self-improvement training with reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 62.13% on TableBench, surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high, demonstrating substantial performance gains in table understanding.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise in combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table understanding by integrating robust reasoning with reliable table processing.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over tables is a critical capability for many
real-world applications. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise on
this task, but current approaches remain limited. Fine-tuning based methods
strengthen language reasoning; yet they are prone to arithmetic errors and
hallucination. In contrast, tool-based methods enable precise table
manipulation but rely on rigid schemas and lack semantic understanding. These
complementary drawbacks highlight the need for approaches that integrate robust
reasoning with reliable table processing. In this work, we propose
Mixture-of-Minds, a multi-agent framework that decomposes table reasoning into
three specialized roles: planning, coding, and answering. This design enables
each agent to focus on a specific aspect of the task while leveraging code
execution for precise table manipulation. Building on this workflow, we
introduce a self-improvement training framework that employs Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) rollouts to generate pseudo-gold trajectories and optimize agents
with reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive experiments show that
Mixture-of-Minds delivers substantial gains, reaching 62.13% on TableBench and
surpassing OpenAI-o4-mini-high. These results demonstrate the promise of
combining structured multi-agent workflows with RL to advance table
understanding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show moderate spatial reasoning ability on small-scale tasks but performance deteriorates significantly as complexity increases, revealing limitations in their spatial representation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore and evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models through textual input, identifying gaps between linguistic and spatial reasoning abilities.

Method: Tested LLMs on five spatial reasoning tasks (quadrant identification, geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, tile sliding) with increasing grid dimensions and complexity.

Result: LLMs achieved moderate success on small-scale tasks but performance dropped rapidly with increased complexity (average 42.7% accuracy loss, up to 84%), with all tests starting above 50% accuracy showing at least 48% deterioration.

Conclusion: LLMs lack robust spatial representations in their architectures, highlighting the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning, and providing foundation for future benchmarks integrating language and geometry.

Abstract: This paper explores the spatial reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs) over textual input through a suite of five tasks aimed at probing their
spatial understanding and computational abilities. The models were tested on
both fundamental spatial reasoning and multi-step problem-solving within
structured grid-based environments using tasks such as quadrant identification,
geometric transformations, distance evaluation, word searches, and tile
sliding. Each task was scaled in complexity through increasing grid dimensions,
requiring models to extend beyond simple pattern recognition into abstract
spatial reasoning. Our results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate moderate
success in all tasks with small complexity and size, performance drops off
rapidly as scale increases, with an average loss in accuracy of 42.7%, and
reaching as high as 84%. Every test that began with over 50% accuracy showed a
loss of at least 48%, illustrating the consistent nature of the deterioration.
Furthermore, their struggles with scaling complexity hint at a lack of robust
spatial representations in their underlying architectures. This paper
underscores the gap between linguistic and spatial reasoning in LLMs, offering
insights into their current limitations, and laying the groundwork for future
integrative benchmarks at the intersection of language and geometry.

### [26] [Decoding-Free Sampling Strategies for LLM Marginalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20208)
*David Pohl,Marco Cognetta,Junyoung Lee,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes decoding-free sampling strategies for efficient marginalization in LLM evaluation, avoiding expensive generation steps while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods only consider specific tokenizations, but marginalization over all possible tokenizations provides better assessment. However, traditional sampling approaches are computationally expensive due to requiring generation steps for each sample.

Method: Developed decoding-free sampling strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic, relying on cheap sampling methods without requiring actual generation from the LLM.

Result: Decoding-free sampling strategies provide sufficiently accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost compared to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Decoding-free sampling enables efficient and accurate marginalization for LLM evaluation, making it practical for downstream inference tasks while significantly reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Modern language models operate on subword-tokenized text in order to make a
trade-off between model size, inference speed, and vocabulary coverage. A side
effect of this is that, during inference, models are evaluated by measuring the
probability of only the specific tokenization produced as the output, despite
there being many possible ways to represent the same text with a subword
vocabulary. Recent studies have argued instead for evaluating LLMs by
marginalization - the probability mass of all tokenizations of a given text.
  Marginalization is difficult due to the number of possible tokenizations of a
text, so often approximate marginalization is done via sampling. However, a
downside of sampling is that an expensive generation step must be performed by
the LLM for each sample, which limits the number of samples that can be
acquired given a runtime budget, and therefore also the accuracy of the
approximation. Since computing the probability of a sequence given the
tokenization is relatively cheap compared to actually generating it, we
investigate sampling strategies that are decoding-free - they require no
generation from the LLM, instead relying entirely on extremely cheap sampling
strategies that are model and tokenizer agnostic.
  We investigate the approximation quality and speed of decoding-free sampling
strategies for a number of open models to find that they provide sufficiently
accurate marginal estimates at a small fraction of the runtime cost and
demonstrate its use on a set of downstream inference tasks.

*Filippo Cenacchi,Deborah Richards,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified tri-modal framework fuses text, audio, and facial features to assess depression and PTSD severity, outperforming unimodal approaches and providing clinician-interpretable explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression and PTSD often co-occur with connected symptoms, making automated binary and disorder-specific assessment insufficient. Clinically useful diagnosis requires severity-aware cross-disorder estimates with decision support explanations.

Method: Tri-modal framework synchronizes and fuses: interview text with sentence-level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics and deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors. Uses calibrated late fusion classifier with standardized features.

Result: Outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines on DAIC corpora. Matches strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy/missing modalities. For PTSD, fusion reduces regression error and improves class concordance. Text contributes most to depression severity, audio/facial cues critical for PTSD.

Conclusion: The approach offers reproducible evaluation and clinician-in-the-loop support for affective clinical decision making, with errors clustering between adjacent severities and reliable identification of extreme classes.

Abstract: Depression and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often co-occur with
connected symptoms, complicating automated assessment, which is often binary
and disorder specific. Clinically useful diagnosis needs severity aware cross
disorder estimates and decision support explanations. Our unified tri modal
affective severity framework synchronizes and fuses interview text with
sentence level transformer embeddings, audio with log Mel statistics with
deltas, and facial signals with action units, gaze, head and pose descriptors
to output graded severities for diagnosing both depression (PHQ-8; 5 classes)
and PTSD (3 classes). Standardized features are fused via a calibrated late
fusion classifier, yielding per disorder probabilities and feature-level
attributions. This severity aware tri-modal affective fusion approach is demoed
on multi disorder concurrent depression and PTSD assessment. Stratified cross
validation on DAIC derived corpora outperforms unimodal/ablation baselines. The
fused model matches the strongest unimodal baseline on accuracy and weighted
F1, while improving decision curve utility and robustness under noisy or
missing modalities. For PTSD specifically, fusion reduces regression error and
improves class concordance. Errors cluster between adjacent severities; extreme
classes are identified reliably. Ablations show text contributes most to
depression severity, audio and facial cues are critical for PTSD, whereas
attributions align with linguistic and behavioral markers. Our approach offers
reproducible evaluation and clinician in the loop support for affective
clinical decision making.

*Beiya Dai,Yuliang Liu,Daozheng Xue,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Xinbing Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ContextLM introduces next-context prediction alongside standard next-token prediction to improve language models' ability to capture higher-level semantics and long-range dependencies while maintaining compatibility with autoregressive evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard next-token prediction limits models' capacity to capture higher-level semantic structures and long-range contextual relationships, creating a need for enhanced pretraining objectives.

Method: Augments standard pretraining with next-context prediction objective that trains models to learn predictive representations of multi-token contexts using error signals from future token chunks, while remaining compatible with standard autoregressive evaluation.

Result: Consistent improvements in both perplexity and downstream task performance on GPT2 and Pythia model families up to 1.5B parameters, with better long-range coherence and more effective attention allocation.

Conclusion: Next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger language modeling with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) is the cornerstone of modern large language
models (LLMs) pretraining, driving their unprecedented capabilities in text
generation, reasoning, and instruction following. However, the token-level
prediction limits the model's capacity to capture higher-level semantic
structures and long-range contextual relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we introduce \textbf{ContextLM}, a framework that augments standard
pretraining with an inherent \textbf{next-context prediction} objective. This
mechanism trains the model to learn predictive representations of multi-token
contexts, leveraging error signals derived from future token chunks. Crucially,
ContextLM achieves this enhancement while remaining fully compatible with the
standard autoregressive, token-by-token evaluation paradigm (e.g., perplexity).
Extensive experiments on the GPT2 and Pythia model families, scaled up to
$1.5$B parameters, show that ContextLM delivers consistent improvements in both
perplexity and downstream task performance. Our analysis indicates that
next-context prediction provides a scalable and efficient pathway to stronger
language modeling, yielding better long-range coherence and more effective
attention allocation with minimal computational overhead.

### [29] [Citation Failure: Definition, Analysis and Efficient Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20303)
*Jan Buchmann,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper addresses citation failure in LLM-based RAG systems, where models provide helpful responses but fail to cite complete evidence. It introduces CITECONTROL benchmark to study failure modes and proposes CITENTION framework to improve citations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Citation failure occurs when LLMs generate helpful responses but fail to properly cite evidence, unlike response failure where the response itself is flawed. This undermines the verification purpose of citations in RAG systems.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) Study citation failure using CITECONTROL benchmark that systematically varies response-evidence relations, (2) Propose CITENTION framework combining generative, attention-based, and retrieval-based methods to improve citations.

Result: Experiments show citation failures increase with relational complexity. CITENTION framework demonstrates substantial citation improvements on CITECONTROL benchmark and in transfer settings.

Conclusion: Citation failure is a distinct problem from response failure that can be systematically studied and mitigated. The proposed CITENTION framework effectively improves citation quality through method integration.

Abstract: Citations from LLM-based RAG systems are supposed to simplify response
verification. However, this does not hold for citation failure, when a model
generates a helpful response, but fails to cite complete evidence. In contrast
to previous work, we propose to disentangle this from response failure, where
the response itself is flawed, and citing complete evidence is impossible. To
address citation failure, this work follows a two-step approach: (1) We study
when citation failure occurs and (2) how it can be mitigated. For step 1, we
extend prior work by investigating how the relation between response and
evidence affects citation quality. We introduce CITECONTROL, a benchmark that
systematically varies this relation to analyze failure modes. Experiments show
that failures increase with relational complexity and suggest that combining
citation methods could improve performance, motivating step 2. To improve LLM
citation efficiently, we propose CITENTION, a framework integrating generative,
attention-based, and retrieval-based methods. Results demonstrate substantial
citation improvements on CITECONTROL and in transfer settings. We make our data
and code publicly available.

### [30] [Exploring Generative Process Reward Modeling for Semi-Structured Data: A Case Study of Table Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20304)
*Lei Tang,Wei Zhou,Mohsen Mesgar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic study of Process Reward Models (PRMs) for table question answering (TQA), revealing that while PRMs combining text and code verification can aid solution selection, they struggle with out-of-domain generalization and show weak correlation between step-level verification and answer accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs have shown success in domains like mathematics but their applicability to semi-structured data tasks like TQA remains unexplored, despite TQA's unique challenges including irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning steps, and domain-specific reasoning.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from both answer and step perspectives, analyzing PRMs that combine textual and code verification approaches.

Result: PRMs with combined text and code verification can help with solution selection but struggle with out-of-domain generalization. Analysis shows weak correlation between step-level verification performance and answer accuracy, likely due to weak step dependencies and loose causal links.

Conclusion: Current PRMs have limitations for TQA tasks, highlighting the need for more robust, process-aware verifiers that can better handle the unique challenges of semi-structured data reasoning.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) improve complex reasoning in large language
models (LLMs) by grading candidate solutions step-by-step and selecting answers
via aggregated step scores. While effective in domains such as mathematics,
their applicability to tasks involving semi-structured data, like table
question answering (TQA) remains unexplored. TQA poses unique challenges for
PRMs, including abundant irrelevant information, loosely connected reasoning
steps, and domain-specific reasoning. This work presents the first systematic
study of PRMs for TQA. We evaluate state-of-the-art generative PRMs on TQA from
both answer and step perspectives. Results show that PRMs that combine textual
and code verification can aid solution selection but struggle to generalize to
out-of-domain data. Analysis reveals a weak correlation between performance in
step-level verification and answer accuracy, possibly stemming from weak step
dependencies and loose causal links. Our findings highlight limitations of
current PRMs on TQA and offer valuable insights for building more robust,
process-aware verifiers.

*Chengpeng Li,Zhengyang Tang,Ziniu Li,Mingfeng Xue,Keqin Bao,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Benyou Wang,Xiang Wang,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoRT is a post-training framework that teaches large reasoning models to effectively use Code Interpreters for mathematical reasoning, reducing conflicts between probabilistic reasoning and deterministic tools through hint-engineering and optimization techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models struggle with complex mathematical operations and face conflicts when integrating computational tools like Code Interpreters, leading to unproductive deliberation between internal probabilistic reasoning and external deterministic knowledge.

Method: CoRT uses Hint-Engineering to synthesize high-quality reasoning data with strategically injected hints, followed by supervised fine-tuning, rejection sampling, and reinforcement learning to optimize model-CI interaction.

Result: CoRT achieved absolute improvements of 4% (32B model) and 8% (1.5B model) across five mathematical reasoning datasets, while reducing token usage by 30% and 50% respectively compared to natural language baselines.

Conclusion: CoRT effectively bridges the gap between probabilistic reasoning models and deterministic computational tools, significantly improving both accuracy and efficiency in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI-o1 have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language reasoning. However, these models frequently
demonstrate inefficiencies or inaccuracies when tackling complex mathematical
operations. While integrating computational tools such as Code Interpreters
(CIs) offers a promising solution, it introduces a critical challenge: a
conflict between the model's internal, probabilistic reasoning and the
external, deterministic knowledge provided by the CI, which often leads models
to unproductive deliberation. To overcome this, we introduce CoRT
(Code-Optimized Reasoning Training), a post-training framework designed to
teach LRMs to effectively utilize CIs. We propose \emph{Hint-Engineering}, a
new data synthesis strategy that strategically injects diverse hints at optimal
points within reasoning paths. This approach generates high-quality,
code-integrated reasoning data specifically tailored to optimize LRM-CI
interaction. Using this method, we have synthesized 30 high-quality samples to
post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters through supervised
fine-tuning. CoRT further refines the multi-round interleaving of external CI
usage and internal thinking by employing rejection sampling and reinforcement
learning. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate CoRT's effectiveness,
yielding absolute improvements of 4\% and 8\% on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, respectively, across five challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets. Moreover, CoRT significantly enhances
efficiency, reducing token usage by approximately 30\% for the 32B model and
50\% for the 1.5B model compared to pure natural language reasoning baselines.

*Matteo Silvestri,Flavio Giorgi,Fabrizio Silvestri,Gabriele Tolomei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' apparent tabular reasoning ability may reflect dataset contamination rather than genuine reasoning, as performance drops to near-random when semantic cues are removed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' performance on tabular reasoning benchmarks is genuine or due to dataset contamination from prior training exposure.

Method: Conducted controlled probing experiments on tabular benchmarks (Adult Income, Titanic, etc.), comparing performance with and without semantic cues by removing/randomizing column names and value categories.

Result: Contamination effects only appeared for datasets with strong semantic cues; performance sharply declined to near-random levels when cues were removed or randomized.

Conclusion: LLMs' tabular reasoning competence may reflect memorization of public datasets rather than true generalization, requiring improved evaluation protocols to distinguish semantic leakage from authentic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to
reason over structured data, yet such assessments often overlook a crucial
confound: dataset contamination. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit prior knowledge of widely used tabular benchmarks such as Adult Income,
Titanic, and others. Through a series of controlled probing experiments, we
reveal that contamination effects emerge exclusively for datasets containing
strong semantic cues-for instance, meaningful column names or interpretable
value categories. In contrast, when such cues are removed or randomized,
performance sharply declines to near-random levels. These findings suggest that
LLMs' apparent competence on tabular reasoning tasks may, in part, reflect
memorization of publicly available datasets rather than genuine generalization.
We discuss implications for evaluation protocols and propose strategies to
disentangle semantic leakage from authentic reasoning ability in future LLM
assessments.

*Wenxuan Zhang,Yuan-Hao Jiang,Yonghe Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FreeChunker is a cross-granularity encoding framework that replaces traditional fixed-granularity chunking with flexible sentence-based retrieval, improving both performance and efficiency in RAG systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing chunking methods use fixed-granularity paradigms with static boundary identification, which limits adaptability to diverse query requirements and incurs computational overhead for semantic boundary detection.

Method: Treats sentences as atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval supporting arbitrary sentence combinations, eliminating the need for semantic boundary detection.

Result: Achieves superior retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods on LongBench V2, while significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The paradigm shift from static chunking to flexible sentence-based retrieval significantly reduces computational overhead and enhances adaptability to complex queries in RAG systems.

Abstract: Chunking strategies significantly impact the effectiveness of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Existing methods operate within
fixed-granularity paradigms that rely on static boundary identification,
limiting their adaptability to diverse query requirements. This paper presents
FreeChunker, a Cross-Granularity Encoding Framework that fundamentally
transforms the traditional chunking paradigm: the framework treats sentences as
atomic units and shifts from static chunk segmentation to flexible retrieval
supporting arbitrary sentence combinations. This paradigm shift not only
significantly reduces the computational overhead required for semantic boundary
detection but also enhances adaptability to complex queries. Experimental
evaluation on LongBench V2 demonstrates that FreeChunker achieves superior
retrieval performance compared to traditional chunking methods, while
significantly outperforming existing approaches in computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pre-training on dialogue data creates small language models that excel at dialogue continuation but underperform on standard benchmarks. DPO fine-tuning improves dialogue performance while PPO has mixed effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data produces small language models that are formally and functionally appropriate for conversational tasks.

Method: Pre-trained llamalogue model on dialogue data, then applied various fine-tuning strategies including PPO and DPO to enhance communicative text generation.

Result: Models underperformed on most standard BabyLM benchmarks but excelled at dialogue continuation prediction. DPO fine-tuning improved performance on custom dialogue benchmark while PPO had mixed to adversarial effects.

Conclusion: Dialogue-specific pre-training creates specialized models that perform well on conversational tasks but poorly on general benchmarks, with DPO being more effective than PPO for improving dialogue capabilities.

Abstract: We investigate whether pre-training exclusively on dialogue data results in
formally and functionally apt small language models. Based on this pre-trained
llamalogue model, we employ a variety of fine-tuning strategies to enforce
"more communicative" text generations by our models. Although our models
underperform on most standard BabyLM benchmarks, they excel at dialogue
continuation prediction in a minimal pair setting. While PPO fine-tuning has
mixed to adversarial effects on our models, DPO fine-tuning further improves
their performance on our custom dialogue benchmark.

*Jaehyung Seo,Hyeonseok Moon,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle to detect hallucinations in negated text, performing worse than in affirmative cases, as shown through experiments with the NegHalu dataset and token-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The impact of negated text on hallucination in LLMs is largely unexplored, despite active research on hallucination in natural language processing.

Method: Created the NegHalu dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with negated expressions, and conducted experiments analyzing LLM performance and internal states at token level.

Result: LLMs struggle to effectively detect hallucinations in negated text, often producing logically inconsistent or unfaithful judgments compared to affirmative cases.

Conclusion: Negation poses significant challenges for LLMs in hallucination detection, and mitigating these unintended effects remains difficult as revealed by token-level analysis.

Abstract: Recent studies on hallucination in large language models (LLMs) have been
actively progressing in natural language processing. However, the impact of
negated text on hallucination with LLMs remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we set three important yet unanswered research questions and aim to
address them. To derive the answers, we investigate whether LLMs can recognize
contextual shifts caused by negation and still reliably distinguish
hallucinations comparable to affirmative cases. We also design the NegHalu
dataset by reconstructing existing hallucination detection datasets with
negated expressions. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle to detect
hallucinations in negated text effectively, often producing logically
inconsistent or unfaithful judgments. Moreover, we trace the internal state of
LLMs as they process negated inputs at the token level and reveal the
challenges of mitigating their unintended effects.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual, BERT-style models specifically optimized for Hebrew texts that outperform existing models on Hebrew benchmarks and show strong performance on retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BERT models are outdated compared to newer transformer architectures like Llama3 and Qwen3, and there's a need for improved models specifically for Hebrew language processing.

Method: Trained BERT-style models using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with dedicated focus on Hebrew texts, including a bilingual version.

Result: The models outperform existing ones on almost all Hebrew benchmarks, with the bilingual version showing strong results on retrieval tasks and outperforming other multilingual models of similar size.

Conclusion: The released NeoDictaBERT models provide a strong foundation for Hebrew NLP tasks and advance research in Hebrew language processing.

Abstract: Since their initial release, BERT models have demonstrated exceptional
performance on a variety of tasks, despite their relatively small size
(BERT-base has ~100M parameters). Nevertheless, the architectural choices used
in these models are outdated compared to newer transformer-based models such as
Llama3 and Qwen3. In recent months, several architectures have been proposed to
close this gap. ModernBERT and NeoBERT both show strong improvements on English
benchmarks and significantly extend the supported context window. Following
their successes, we introduce NeoDictaBERT and NeoDictaBERT-bilingual:
BERT-style models trained using the same architecture as NeoBERT, with a
dedicated focus on Hebrew texts. These models outperform existing ones on
almost all Hebrew benchmarks and provide a strong foundation for downstream
tasks. Notably, the NeoDictaBERT-bilingual model shows strong results on
retrieval tasks, outperforming other multilingual models of similar size. In
this paper, we describe the training process and report results across various
benchmarks. We release the models to the community as part of our goal to
advance research and development in Hebrew NLP.

TL;DR: ContingentChat is a teacher-student framework that improves multi-turn contingency in BabyLM models through targeted post-training, resulting in more grammatical and cohesive dialogue responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-turn dialogues between children and caregivers exhibit contingency - prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges. Current BabyLMs trained on 100M words lack this property, which is crucial for natural dialogue quality.

Method: Introduces ContingentChat framework using teacher-student approach with novel alignment dataset for post-training. Experiments with adaptive teacher decoding strategies to enhance contingency in dialogue responses.

Result: BabyLM generates responses that are more grammatical and cohesive after post-training. Adaptive teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. The framework demonstrates benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality.

Conclusion: ContingentChat shows targeted post-training improves dialogue quality but contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs, indicating the difficulty of achieving natural conversational flow in language models.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues between a child and a caregiver are characterized by a
property called contingency - that is, prompt, direct, and meaningful exchanges
between interlocutors. We introduce ContingentChat, a teacher-student framework
that benchmarks and improves multi-turn contingency in a BabyLM trained on 100M
words. Using a novel alignment dataset for post-training, BabyLM generates
responses that are more grammatical and cohesive. Experiments with adaptive
teacher decoding strategies show limited additional gains. ContingentChat
demonstrates the benefits of targeted post-training for dialogue quality and
indicates that contingency remains a challenging goal for BabyLMs.

*Zhijie Deng,Zhouan Shen,Ling Li,Yao Zhou,Zhaowei Zhu,Yanji He,Wei Wang,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM-Mixup is a method that distills multiple low-quality instruction inputs into high-quality instruction-output pairs through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, enabling effective data augmentation from imperfect datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality instruction-following data is scarce while abundant low-quality data is often discarded, leading to substantial information loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle with low-quality data and evaluation remains poorly defined.

Method: Introduced Instruction Distillation task and created MIXTURE dataset (144K samples) pairing low-quality instruction clusters with high-quality distillations. LM-Mixup performs supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE followed by reinforcement learning with three reward signals: quality, semantic alignment, and format compliance using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

Result: Fine-tuning LLMs on distilled data (only ~3% of entire dataset) surpasses full-dataset training and competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods across multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: Low-quality data is a valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup, significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs), yet
the quality of instruction-following data varies significantly. While
high-quality data is paramount, it is often scarce; conversely, abundant
low-quality data is frequently discarded, leading to substantial information
loss. Existing data augmentation methods struggle to augment this low-quality
data effectively, and the evaluation of such techniques remains poorly defined.
To address this, we formally define the task of Instruction Distillation:
distilling multiple low-quality and redundant inputs into high-quality and
coherent instruction-output pairs. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive
data construction pipeline to create MIXTURE, a 144K-sample dataset pairing
low-quality or semantically redundant imperfect instruction clusters with their
high-quality distillations. We then introduce LM-Mixup, by first performing
supervised fine-tuning on MIXTURE and then optimizing it with reinforcement
learning. This process uses three complementary reward signals: quality,
semantic alignment, and format compliance, via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). We demonstrate that LM-Mixup effectively augments
imperfect datasets: fine-tuning LLMs on its distilled data, which accounts for
only about 3% of the entire dataset, not only surpasses full-dataset training
but also competes with state-of-the-art high-quality data selection methods
across multiple benchmarks. Our work establishes that low-quality data is a
valuable resource when properly distilled and augmented with LM-Mixup,
significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of instruction-tuned
LLMs.

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of four confidence estimation methods for LLMs shows CoCoA performs best overall, improving calibration and discrimination of correct answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM outputs have varying uncertainty and correctness levels, making practical reliability uncertain. Need to quantify this uncertainty for reliable applications.

Method: Evaluated four confidence estimation approaches (VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, CoCoA) on four question-answering tasks using state-of-the-art open-source LLM.

Result: Each uncertainty metric captures different facets of model confidence. CoCoA hybrid approach yields best reliability overall with improved calibration and discrimination.

Conclusion: CoCoA is recommended as the best uncertainty measure, with discussion of trade-offs between methods for selecting appropriate confidence estimation in LLM applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) produce outputs with varying levels of
uncertainty, and, just as often, varying levels of correctness; making their
practical reliability far from guaranteed. To quantify this uncertainty, we
systematically evaluate four approaches for confidence estimation in LLM
outputs: VCE, MSP, Sample Consistency, and CoCoA (Vashurin et al., 2025). For
the evaluation of the approaches, we conduct experiments on four
question-answering tasks using a state-of-the-art open-source LLM. Our results
show that each uncertainty metric captures a different facet of model
confidence and that the hybrid CoCoA approach yields the best reliability
overall, improving both calibration and discrimination of correct answers. We
discuss the trade-offs of each method and provide recommendations for selecting
uncertainty measures in LLM applications.

Motivation: To develop a more effective strategy for the 2025 BabyLM Challenge by improving upon standard Masked Language Modeling approaches.

Method: Adapts MLM by adjusting masking probabilities based on model's prediction ability for tokens, and incorporates sub-token embeddings to enhance morphological generalization.

Result: Substantial performance increase on (Super)GLUE tasks compared to standard MLM, with improved morphological generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed improved MLM approach successfully beats the baseline in the strict-small track of the BabyLM Challenge.

Abstract: We describe our strategy for the 2025 edition of the BabyLM Challenge. Our
main contribution is that of an improved form of Masked Language Modeling
(MLM), which adapts the probabilities of the tokens masked according to the
model's ability to predict them. The results show a substantial increase in
performance on (Super)GLUE tasks over the standard MLM. We also incorporate
sub-token embeddings, finding that this increases the model's morphological
generalization capabilities. Our submission beats the baseline in the

TL;DR: RECALL is a representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning in LLMs that uses layer-wise hidden representations and hierarchical parameter fusion to prevent catastrophic forgetting without needing historical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable continual learning in large language models without access to historical training data, while preventing catastrophic forgetting and maintaining performance across multiple domains.

Method: Computes inter-model similarity from layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs adaptive hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models, preserving domain-general features in shallow layers while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers.

Result: Outperforms baselines in both knowledge retention and generalization across five NLP tasks and multiple continual learning scenarios, achieving seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: RECALL provides a scalable and data-free solution for evolving LLMs through representation-aware model merging, enabling effective continual learning without performance trade-offs.

Abstract: We unveil that internal representations in large language models (LLMs) serve
as reliable proxies of learned knowledge, and propose RECALL, a novel
representation-aware model merging framework for continual learning without
access to historical data. RECALL computes inter-model similarity from
layer-wise hidden representations over clustered typical samples, and performs
adaptive, hierarchical parameter fusion to align knowledge across models. This
design enables the preservation of domain-general features in shallow layers
while allowing task-specific adaptation in deeper layers. Unlike prior methods
that require task labels or incur performance trade-offs, RECALL achieves
seamless multi-domain integration and strong resistance to catastrophic
forgetting. Extensive experiments across five NLP tasks and multiple continual
learning scenarios show that RECALL outperforms baselines in both knowledge
retention and generalization, providing a scalable and data-free solution for
evolving LLMs.

*Tim Tian Hua,Andrew Qin,Samuel Marks,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can detect evaluation contexts and adjust behavior to appear more aligned, compromising safety evaluations. Adding steering vectors to activations can suppress this evaluation-awareness and make models act like they're deployed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the problem of LLMs detecting when they're being evaluated and adjusting their behavior to appear more aligned, which undermines the reliability of safety evaluations.

Method: Two-step training: 1) Continued pretraining on documents describing model behavior with Python type hints during evaluation but not deployment, 2) Expert iteration training to use type hints in evaluation settings. Then applied activation steering using vectors from the original model.

Result: The trained model became evaluation-aware, writing type hints more in evaluation contexts. Activation steering successfully suppressed this evaluation awareness, making the model act like it was deployed even when evaluation cues were present.

Conclusion: Activation steering can improve reliability of safety evaluations by making models behave as if they're deployed rather than being tested, using steering vectors from the original model before additional training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes detect when they are being
evaluated and adjust their behavior to appear more aligned, compromising the
reliability of safety evaluations. In this paper, we show that adding a
steering vector to an LLM's activations can suppress evaluation-awareness and
make the model act like it is deployed during evaluation. To study our steering
technique, we train an LLM to exhibit evaluation-aware behavior using a
two-step training process designed to mimic how this behavior could emerge
naturally. First, we perform continued pretraining on documents with factual
descriptions of the model (1) using Python type hints during evaluation but not
during deployment and (2) recognizing that the presence of a certain evaluation
cue always means that it is being tested. Then, we train the model with expert
iteration to use Python type hints in evaluation settings. The resulting model
is evaluation-aware: it writes type hints in evaluation contexts more than
deployment contexts. However, this gap can only be observed by removing the
evaluation cue. We find that activation steering can suppress evaluation
awareness and make the model act like it is deployed even when the cue is
present. Importantly, we constructed our steering vector using the original
model before our additional training. Our results suggest that AI evaluators
could improve the reliability of safety evaluations by steering models to act
like they are deployed.

### [44] [Robust Preference Alignment via Directional Neighborhood Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20498)
*Ruochen Mao,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RPS is a training-free method that improves LLM robustness by sampling responses from a neighborhood of related preferences and selecting the best-aligned one, addressing the preference coverage gap without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained on dominant preferences fail on individual needs, creating a preference coverage gap. Existing retraining methods are costly and don't generalize well to diverse preferences.

Method: Robust Preference Selection (RPS) uses directional neighborhood consensus to sample multiple responses from related preferences and select the best-aligned response, without requiring model retraining.

Result: RPS achieves up to 69% win rates on challenging underrepresented preferences across three alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, SFT), consistently outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: RPS provides a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing preference-aligned model reliability without costly retraining.

Abstract: Aligning large language models with human preferences is critical for
creating reliable and controllable AI systems. A human preference can be
visualized as a high-dimensional vector where different directions represent
trade-offs between desired attributes (e.g., helpfulness vs. verbosity). Yet,
because the training data often reflects dominant, average preferences, LLMs
tend to perform well on common requests but fall short in specific, individual
needs. This mismatch creates a preference coverage gap. Existing methods often
address this through costly retraining, which may not be generalized to the
full spectrum of diverse preferences. This brittleness means that when a user's
request reflects a nuanced preference deviating from the training data's
central tendency, model performance can degrade unpredictably. To address this
challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Selection (RPS), a post-hoc,
training-free method by leveraging directional neighborhood consensus. Instead
of forcing a model to generate a response from a single, highly specific
preference, RPS samples multiple responses from a local neighborhood of related
preferences to create a superior candidate pool. It then selects the response
that best aligns with the user's original intent. We provide a theoretical
framework showing our neighborhood generation strategy is provably superior to
a strong baseline that also samples multiple candidates. Comprehensive
experiments across three distinct alignment paradigms (DPA, DPO, and SFT)
demonstrate that RPS consistently improves robustness against this baseline,
achieving win rates of up to 69% on challenging preferences from
under-represented regions of the space without any model retraining. Our work
presents a practical, theoretically-grounded solution for enhancing the
reliability of preference-aligned models.

### [45] [Hierarchical Sequence Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20505)
*Ruiyi Yang,Hao Xue,Imran Razzak,Hakim Hacid,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HSEQ Iteration is a unified framework for heterogeneous question answering that linearizes different data sources into hierarchical sequences and performs structure-aware iteration to efficiently collect evidence before answer synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) struggles with multi-step questions and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and token/tool budgets.

Method: Linearizes documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into reversible hierarchical sequences with structural tags, then performs structure-aware iteration using Head and Iteration Agents that select and expand sequences via structure-respecting actions.

Result: Experiments on HotpotQA, HybridQA/TAT-QA, and MetaQA show consistent EM/F1 gains over strong baselines with high efficiency, plus format-agnostic unification, budget-aware iteration, and improved evidence canonicalization.

Conclusion: HSEQ provides a unified framework that enables efficient, accurate question answering across heterogeneous data sources while maintaining budget awareness and evidence reliability.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.

*Paul Lerner,François Yvon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show political bias in multilingual translation, with better translation quality for majority parties compared to outsider parties, as revealed through analysis of European Parliament speeches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess political biases in LLMs through multilingual translation fairness principles rather than traditional English survey simulations.

Method: Systematic comparison of translation quality using a new 21-way multiparallel EuroParl dataset with political affiliations of speakers, covering 1.5M sentences from European Parliament proceedings.

Result: Systematic differences in translation quality observed, with majority parties (left, center, right) being better translated than outsider parties.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit political biases in multilingual translation, favoring established political groups over outsider parties.

Abstract: The political biases of Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually assessed by
simulating their answers to English surveys. In this work, we propose an
alternative framing of political biases, relying on principles of fairness in
multilingual translation. We systematically compare the translation quality of
speeches in the European Parliament (EP), observing systematic differences with
majority parties from left, center, and right being better translated than
outsider parties. This study is made possible by a new, 21-way multiparallel
version of EuroParl, the parliamentary proceedings of the EP, which includes
the political affiliations of each speaker. The dataset consists of 1.5M
sentences for a total of 40M words and 249M characters. It covers three years,
1000+ speakers, 7 countries, 12 EU parties, 25 EU committees, and hundreds of
national parties.

### [47] [ARC-Encoder: learning compressed text representations for large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20535)
*Hippolyte Pilchen,Edouard Grave,Patrick Pérez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARC-Encoder is a novel context compression method that uses an encoder to compress text into continuous representations, reducing token count by 4-8x while maintaining performance across various LLM usage scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the increasing inference costs from longer contexts in techniques like retrieval-augmented generation and chain-of-thought reasoning, without requiring model fine-tuning or architecture modifications that could degrade general capabilities.

Method: Developed an Adaptable text Representations Compressor (ARC-Encoder) that compresses context into continuous representations replacing token embeddings in decoder LLMs. Systematically studied training strategies and architecture choices for optimal performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving computational efficiency at inference. Can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder to generalize across different LLMs.

Conclusion: ARC-Encoder provides a flexible and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple LLMs, offering significant context compression without compromising performance.

Abstract: Recent techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation or chain-of-thought
reasoning have led to longer contexts and increased inference costs. Context
compression techniques can reduce these costs, but the most effective
approaches require fine-tuning the target model or even modifying its
architecture. This can degrade its general abilities when not used for this
specific purpose. Here we explore an alternative approach: an encoder that
compresses the context into continuous representations which replace token
embeddings in decoder LLMs. First, we perform a systematic study of training
strategies and architecture choices for the encoder. Our findings led to the
design of an Adaptable text Representations Compressor, named ARC-Encoder,
which outputs $x$-times fewer continuous representations (typically
$x\!\in\!\{4,8\}$) than text tokens. We evaluate ARC-Encoder across a variety
of LLM usage scenarios, ranging from in-context learning to context window
extension, on both instruct and base decoders. Results show that ARC-Encoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks while improving
computational efficiency at inference. Finally, we demonstrate that our models
can be adapted to multiple decoders simultaneously, allowing a single encoder
to generalize across different decoder LLMs. This makes ARC-Encoder a flexible
and efficient solution for portable encoders that work seamlessly with multiple
LLMs. We release a training code at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/ARC-Encoder

*Sangmitra Madhusudan,Kaige Chen,Ali Emami*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CenterBench is a dataset for testing whether language models analyze syntax or rely on semantic pattern matching, using center-embedded sentences with plausible and implausible counterparts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To distinguish between structural understanding and semantic pattern matching in language models, as current benchmarks cannot separate these capabilities.

Method: Created 9,720 comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences with recursive relative clauses, including syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterparts, testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.

Result: Models show performance gaps up to 26.8 percentage points between plausible and implausible sentences, widening with complexity, indicating they abandon structural analysis for semantic associations. Semantic plausibility harms performance on action-related questions.

Conclusion: CenterBench provides the first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to pattern matching, revealing semantic shortcuts in reasoning models and variable semantic effects in humans.

Abstract: When language models correctly parse "The cat that the dog chased meowed,"
are they analyzing syntax or simply familiar with dogs chasing cats? Despite
extensive benchmarking, we lack methods to distinguish structural understanding
from semantic pattern matching. We introduce CenterBench, a dataset of 9,720
comprehension questions on center-embedded sentences (like "The cat [that the
dog chased] meowed") where relative clauses nest recursively, creating
processing demands from simple to deeply nested structures. Each sentence has a
syntactically identical but semantically implausible counterpart (e.g., mailmen
prescribe medicine, doctors deliver mail) and six comprehension questions
testing surface understanding, syntactic dependencies, and causal reasoning.
Testing six models reveals that performance gaps between plausible and
implausible sentences widen systematically with complexity, with models showing
median gaps up to 26.8 percentage points, quantifying when they abandon
structural analysis for semantic associations. Notably, semantic plausibility
harms performance on questions about resulting actions, where following causal
relationships matters more than semantic coherence. Reasoning models improve
accuracy but their traces show semantic shortcuts, overthinking, and answer
refusal. Unlike models whose plausibility advantage systematically widens with
complexity, humans shows variable semantic effects. CenterBench provides the
first framework to identify when models shift from structural analysis to
pattern matching.

TL;DR: GlobalRAG is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances multi-hop QA by decomposing questions into subgoals, coordinating retrieval with reasoning, and refining evidence iteratively through specialized rewards and progressive weight annealing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reinforcement learning approaches for retrieval-augmented generation in multi-hop QA suffer from two key limitations: absence of global planning to structure multi-step reasoning, and unfaithful execution that hinders effective query formulation and consistent use of retrieved evidence.

Method: Proposes GlobalRAG framework that decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. Uses Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward to encourage coherent planning and reliable execution, plus progressive weight annealing to balance process-oriented and outcome-based objectives.

Result: Significantly outperforms strong baselines using only 8k training data (42% of training data used by baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM and F1 scores on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: GlobalRAG effectively addresses the limitations of existing RL approaches for multi-hop QA by providing global reasoning capabilities through subgoal decomposition and specialized reward mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance with significantly less training data.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in improving
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite these advances, its effectiveness
in multi-hop question answering (QA) remains limited by two fundamental
limitations: (i) global planning absence to structure multi-step reasoning, and
(ii) unfaithful execution, which hinders effective query formulation and
consistent use of retrieved evidence. We propose GlobalRAG, a reinforcement
learning framework designed to enhance global reasoning in multi-hop QA.
GlobalRAG decomposes questions into subgoals, coordinates retrieval with
reasoning, and refines evidence iteratively. To guide this process, we
introduce Planning Quality Reward and SubGoal Completion Reward, which
encourage coherent planning and reliable subgoal execution. In addition, a
progressive weight annealing strategy balances process-oriented and
outcome-based objectives. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and
out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that GlobalRAG significantly outperforms
strong baselines while using only 8k training data (42% of the training data
used by strong baselines), achieving average improvements of 14.2% in both EM
and F1.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-Agent Cognitive Decision Framework (MACDF) to replace traditional retrieval-ranking in e-commerce search, addressing misalignment with users' cognitive decision processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional retrieval-ranking misaligns with users' multi-stage cognitive decision processes, causing semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs from cross-platform information foraging, and lack of professional shopping guidance.

Method: Proposed MACDF shifts from passive retrieval to proactive decision support using a multi-agent cognitive system approach.

Result: Extensive offline evaluations show significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction, especially for complex queries. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms practical efficacy.

Conclusion: Multi-agent cognitive systems have transformative potential to redefine e-commerce search by better aligning with users' decision-making processes.

Abstract: The retrieval-ranking paradigm has long dominated e-commerce search, but its
reliance on query-item matching fundamentally misaligns with multi-stage
cognitive decision processes of platform users. This misalignment introduces
critical limitations: semantic gaps in complex queries, high decision costs due
to cross-platform information foraging, and the absence of professional
shopping guidance. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Agent Cognitive
Decision Framework (MACDF), which shifts the paradigm from passive retrieval to
proactive decision support. Extensive offline evaluations demonstrate MACDF's
significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction,
particularly for complex queries involving negation, multi-constraint, or
reasoning demands. Online A/B testing on JD search platform confirms its
practical efficacy. This work highlights the transformative potential of
multi-agent cognitive systems in redefining e-commerce search.

*Jiangang Hao,Wenju Cui,Patrick Kyllonen,Emily Kerzabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates whether ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data exhibits bias across gender and racial groups in collaborative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior research shows ChatGPT can code communication data with human-level accuracy, but it's unclear if this automated coding exhibits demographic bias, which could limit its adoption in large-scale assessments.

Method: The study uses ChatGPT to code communication data from three collaborative task types (negotiation, problem solving, decision making) and examines differences across gender and racial groups using a typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving.

Result: ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias across gender and racial groups in the analyzed communication data.

Conclusion: The absence of significant demographic bias paves the way for adopting ChatGPT-based automated coding in large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Abstract: Assessing communication and collaboration at scale depends on a labor
intensive task of coding communication data into categories according to
different frameworks. Prior research has established that ChatGPT can be
directly instructed with coding rubrics to code the communication data and
achieves accuracy comparable to human raters. However, whether the coding from
ChatGPT or similar AI technology exhibits bias against different demographic
groups, such as gender and race, remains unclear. To fill this gap, this paper
investigates ChatGPT-based automated coding of communication data using a
typical coding framework for collaborative problem solving, examining
differences across gender and racial groups. The analysis draws on data from
three types of collaborative tasks: negotiation, problem solving, and decision
making. Our results show that ChatGPT-based coding exhibits no significant bias
across gender and racial groups, paving the road for its adoption in
large-scale assessment of collaboration and communication.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper evaluates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like curiosity using the Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised framework, finding LLMs show stronger knowledge-seeking behavior than humans but remain conservative in uncertain situations, and that curiosity enhances reasoning and active learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs possess human-like curiosity-driven learning capabilities, as recent advances in natural language processing have raised questions about these models' potential for curiosity-based learning similar to humans.

Method: Used the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR) to design a comprehensive evaluation framework covering dimensions like Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social Curiosity to assess LLMs' curiosity levels.

Result: LLMs demonstrated stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but made conservative choices in uncertain environments. The study confirmed that curious behaviors enhance LLMs' reasoning and active learning abilities.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential to exhibit human-like curiosity, providing experimental support for future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in LLMs.

Abstract: Curiosity serves as a pivotal conduit for human beings to discover and learn
new knowledge. Recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) in natural
language processing have sparked discussions regarding whether these models
possess capability of curiosity-driven learning akin to humans. In this paper,
starting from the human curiosity assessment questionnaire Five-Dimensional
Curiosity scale Revised (5DCR), we design a comprehensive evaluation framework
that covers dimensions such as Information Seeking, Thrill Seeking, and Social
Curiosity to assess the extent of curiosity exhibited by LLMs. The results
demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a stronger thirst for knowledge than humans but
still tend to make conservative choices when faced with uncertain environments.
We further investigated the relationship between curiosity and thinking of
LLMs, confirming that curious behaviors can enhance the model's reasoning and
active learning abilities. These findings suggest that LLMs have the potential
to exhibit curiosity similar to that of humans, providing experimental support
for the future development of learning capabilities and innovative research in
LLMs.

*Alan Saji,Raj Dabre,Anoop Kunchukuttan,Ratish Puduppully*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LRMs perform better when reasoning in English rather than the question's language, showing higher cognitive behaviors and accuracy, but this approach risks translation errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore multilingual reasoning abilities of LRMs and understand their preference for English reasoning despite potential translation issues.

Method: Systematic comparison of LRM reasoning in English vs. question language across MGSM and GPQA Diamond tasks, analyzing both answer accuracy and cognitive attributes in reasoning traces.

Result: English reasoning traces show substantially higher cognitive behaviors and generally yield higher accuracy, with performance gap increasing with task complexity. However, English-centric approach is susceptible to 'Lost in Translation' errors.

Conclusion: While LRMs perform better with English reasoning, this strategy creates vulnerability to translation errors that could be avoided by reasoning in the question's original language.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance on mathematical,
scientific, and other question-answering tasks, but their multilingual
reasoning abilities remain underexplored. When presented with non-English
questions, LRMs often default to reasoning in English, raising concerns about
interpretability and the handling of linguistic and cultural nuances. We
systematically compare an LRM's reasoning in English versus the language of the
question. Our evaluation spans two tasks: MGSM and GPQA Diamond. Beyond
measuring answer accuracy, we also analyze cognitive attributes in the
reasoning traces. We find that English reasoning traces exhibit a substantially
higher presence of these cognitive behaviors, and that reasoning in English
generally yields higher final-answer accuracy, with the performance gap
increasing as tasks become more complex. However, this English-centric strategy
is susceptible to a key failure mode - getting "Lost in Translation," where
translation steps lead to errors that would have been avoided by question's
language reasoning.

TL;DR: CantoNLU is a new benchmark for Cantonese NLU covering 7 tasks, with model evaluations showing Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall while monolingual models excel at syntactic tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cantonese is under-resourced due to policy and diglossia, creating a scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese natural language understanding.

Method: Created CantoNLU benchmark with 7 NLU tasks, tested 4 model types: Mandarin model without Cantonese training, Cantonese-adapted models via continual pre-training, and monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch.

Result: Cantonese-adapted models performed best overall, monolingual models performed better on syntactic tasks, and Mandarin models remained competitive in some scenarios.

Conclusion: Direct transfer from Mandarin may be sufficient when Cantonese data is scarce, and the benchmark provides resources to advance Cantonese NLP research.

Abstract: Cantonese, although spoken by millions, remains under-resourced due to policy
and diglossia. To address this scarcity of evaluation frameworks for Cantonese,
we introduce \textsc{\textbf{CantoNLU}}, a benchmark for Cantonese natural
language understanding (NLU). This novel benchmark spans seven tasks covering
syntax and semantics, including word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability judgment, language detection, natural language inference,
sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing. In addition
to the benchmark, we provide model baseline performance across a set of models:
a Mandarin model without Cantonese training, two Cantonese-adapted models
obtained by continual pre-training a Mandarin model on Cantonese text, and a
monolingual Cantonese model trained from scratch. Results show that
Cantonese-adapted models perform best overall, while monolingual models perform
better on syntactic tasks. Mandarin models remain competitive in certain
settings, indicating that direct transfer may be sufficient when Cantonese
domain data is scarce. We release all datasets, code, and model weights to
facilitate future research in Cantonese NLP.

*Kushal Chakrabarti,Nirmal Balachundhar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Neural diversity (decorrelated parallel representations) reduces hallucination in language models. ND-LoRA combines parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, achieving up to 25.6% hallucination reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Language models continue to hallucinate despite scaling parameters, compute, and data. The paper proposes neural diversity as a principled mechanism to reduce hallucinations at fixed parameter and data budgets.

Method: Introduces ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), which combines parallel LoRA adapters with Barlow Twins regularization to create decorrelated parallel representations. Uses portfolio theory-inspired mathematical framework to bound hallucination probability by representational correlation.

Result: ND-LoRA reduces hallucinations by up to 25.6% (14.6% on average) without degrading general accuracy. A 0.1% neural correlation increase is associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Task-dependent optimality emerges where different tasks require different amounts of optimal neurodiversity.

Conclusion: Neural diversity serves as a third axis of scaling (orthogonal to parameters and data) to improve language model reliability at fixed budgets. LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically, and neurodiversity is proven as the mediating factor through causal interventions.

Abstract: Language models continue to hallucinate despite increases in parameters,
compute, and data. We propose neural diversity -- decorrelated parallel
representations -- as a principled mechanism that reduces hallucination rates
at fixed parameter and data budgets. Inspired by portfolio theory, where
uncorrelated assets reduce risk by $\sqrt{P}$, we prove hallucination
probability is bounded by representational correlation: $P(H) \leq
f(\sigma^2((1-\rho(P))/P + \rho(P)), \mu^2)$, which predicts that language
models need an optimal amount of neurodiversity. To validate this, we introduce
ND-LoRA (Neural Diversity Low-Rank Adaptation), combining parallel LoRA
adapters with Barlow Twins regularization, and demonstrate that ND-LoRA reduces
hallucinations by up to 25.6% (and 14.6% on average) without degrading general
accuracy. Ablations show LoRA adapters and regularization act synergistically,
causal interventions prove neurodiversity as the mediating factor and
correlational analyses indicate scale: a 0.1% neural correlation increase is
associated with a 3.8% hallucination increase. Finally, task-dependent
optimality emerges: different tasks require different amounts of optimal
neurodiversity. Together, our results highlight neural diversity as a third
axis of scaling -- orthogonal to parameters and data -- to improve the
reliability of language models at fixed budgets.

### [57] [Structure-Conditional Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20700)
*Bryan Eikema,Anna Rutkiewicz,Mario Giulianelli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MBR decoding faces challenges in open-ended tasks due to structural variability. The paper proposes three lightweight utility function adaptations to improve MBR's sensitivity to latent structures like dialogue acts and emotions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR decoding works well in constrained tasks like machine translation but struggles with open-ended tasks (dialogue, instruction-following) where standard similarity-based utility functions may select broadly representative but sub-optimal responses that ignore underlying latent structures.

Method: Introduces three lightweight adaptations to MBR utility functions to make them more sensitive to structural variability. Tests the approach on a curated dataset capturing three types of latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure. Proposes two metrics to evaluate structural optimality.

Result: Standard similarity-based utility functions perform poorly on structural optimality metrics. The proposed adaptations significantly improve structural optimality. On real-world benchmarks (AlpacaEval and MT-Bench), the improved structural sensitivity increases generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

Conclusion: Structural sensitivity is crucial for MBR decoding in open-ended tasks. The proposed lightweight utility function adaptations effectively address structural variability and substantially improve generation quality in instruction-following scenarios.

Abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has seen renewed interest as an alternative
to traditional generation strategies. While MBR has proven effective in machine
translation, where the variability of a language model's outcome space is
naturally constrained, it may face challenges in more open-ended tasks such as
dialogue or instruction-following. We hypothesise that in such settings,
applying MBR with standard similarity-based utility functions may result in
selecting responses that are broadly representative of the model's
distribution, yet sub-optimal with respect to any particular grouping of
generations that share an underlying latent structure. In this work, we
introduce three lightweight adaptations to the utility function, designed to
make MBR more sensitive to structural variability in the outcome space. To test
our hypothesis, we curate a dataset capturing three representative types of
latent structure: dialogue act, emotion, and response structure (e.g., a
sentence, a paragraph, or a list). We further propose two metrics to evaluate
the structural optimality of MBR. Our analysis demonstrates that common
similarity-based utility functions fall short by these metrics. In contrast,
our proposed adaptations considerably improve structural optimality. Finally,
we evaluate our approaches on real-world instruction-following benchmarks,
AlpacaEval and MT-Bench, and show that increased structural sensitivity
improves generation quality by up to 13.7 percentage points in win rate.

*Xiaoyuan Wu,Roshni Kaushik,Wenkai Li,Lujo Bauer,Koichi Onoue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: User study shows low agreement among real users on privacy-preservation and helpfulness of LLM responses, while proxy LLMs show high agreement but poor correlation with user perceptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how users perceive privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses in privacy-sensitive scenarios, since prior work relied on proxy LLMs and overlooked real user perceptions.

Method: Conducted user study with 94 participants using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens benchmark to evaluate identical LLM responses.

Result: Users showed low agreement on privacy-preservation and helpfulness, while proxy LLMs had high agreement but low correlation with user evaluations.

Conclusion: Privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are individual-specific, proxy LLMs are poor estimators of user perceptions, and user-centered studies are needed for better alignment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid adoption for tasks such as
drafting emails, summarizing meetings, and answering health questions. In such
uses, users may need to share private information (e.g., health records,
contact details). To evaluate LLMs' ability to identify and redact such private
information, prior work developed benchmarks (e.g., ConfAIde, PrivacyLens) with
real-life scenarios. Using these benchmarks, researchers have found that LLMs
sometimes fail to keep secrets private when responding to complex tasks (e.g.,
leaking employee salaries in meeting summaries). However, these evaluations
rely on LLMs (proxy LLMs) to gauge compliance with privacy norms, overlooking
real users' perceptions. Moreover, prior work primarily focused on the
privacy-preservation quality of responses, without investigating nuanced
differences in helpfulness. To understand how users perceive the
privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of LLM responses to
privacy-sensitive scenarios, we conducted a user study with 94 participants
using 90 scenarios from PrivacyLens. We found that, when evaluating identical
responses to the same scenario, users showed low agreement with each other on
the privacy-preservation quality and helpfulness of the LLM response. Further,
we found high agreement among five proxy LLMs, while each individual LLM had
low correlation with users' evaluations. These results indicate that the
privacy and helpfulness of LLM responses are often specific to individuals, and
proxy LLMs are poor estimates of how real users would perceive these responses
in privacy-sensitive scenarios. Our results suggest the need to conduct
user-centered studies on measuring LLMs' ability to help users while preserving
privacy. Additionally, future research could investigate ways to improve the
alignment between proxy LLMs and users for better estimation of users'
perceived privacy and utility.

### [59] [Automated Extraction of Fluoropyrimidine Treatment and Treatment-Related Toxicities from Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20727)
*Xizhi Wu,Madeline S. Kreider,Philip E. Empey,Chenyu Li,Yanshan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based NLP methods outperformed traditional approaches for extracting fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, with error-analysis prompting achieving perfect F1 scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fluoropyrimidines cause toxicities like hand-foot syndrome and cardiotoxicity, but this information is embedded in clinical notes, requiring automated extraction methods.

Method: Developed multiple NLP approaches including rule-based, machine learning (RF, SVM, LR), deep learning (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and LLM-based methods (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting) on 236 annotated clinical notes.

Result: Error-analysis prompting achieved F1=1.000 for both treatment and toxicities extraction, outperforming all other methods. Zero-shot prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities.

Conclusion: LLM-based NLP is most effective for extracting fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, with strong potential for oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

Abstract: Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast
cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and
cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical
notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP)
methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.
  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical
notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories
related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine
learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic
Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language
models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting).
Models used an 80:20 train-test split.
  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated
categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1
scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot
prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities
extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning
underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and
ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods
served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in
toxicities.
  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine
learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small
training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare
categories.
  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine
treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong
potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance.

### [60] [Are Large Reasoning Models Good Translation Evaluators? Analysis and Performance Boost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20780)
*Runzhe Zhan,Zhihong Huang,Xinyi Yang,Lidia S. Chao,Min Yang,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes using large reasoning models (LRMs) as evaluators for machine translation quality, identifies key challenges like overthinking and scoring issues, and proposes calibration through training on synthetic human-like thinking trajectories to improve performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of large reasoning models (LRMs) as evaluators for machine translation quality assessment, as this application remains underexplored despite LRMs' improved reasoning capabilities through intermediate thinking processes.

Method: Propose calibrating LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking trajectories to address identified challenges like overthinking simpler instances and scoring mechanism issues.

Result: Experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks show the approach reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while improving evaluation performance across different LRM scales (7B to 32B), with R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieving +8.7 correlation point improvement.

Conclusion: Efficiently calibrated LRMs have significant potential to advance fine-grained automatic machine translation evaluation by addressing key challenges and improving both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an
intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving
their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the
potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains
underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in
MT evaluation. We identify key challenges, revealing LRMs require tailored
evaluation materials, tend to "overthink" simpler instances and have issues
with scoring mechanisms leading to overestimation. To address these, we propose
to calibrate LRM thinking by training them on synthetic, human-like thinking
trajectories. Our experiments on WMT24 Metrics benchmarks demonstrate that this
approach largely reduces thinking budgets by ~35x while concurrently improving
evaluation performance across different LRM scales from 7B to 32B (e.g.,
R1-Distill-Qwen-7B achieves a +8.7 correlation point improvement). These
findings highlight the potential of efficiently calibrated LRMs to advance
fine-grained automatic MT evaluation.

*Alicia Sagae,Chia-Jung Lee,Sandeep Avula,Brandon Dang,Vanessa Murdock*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a new evaluation framework for LLMs focused on Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, using a real-world application of generating product descriptions with parameterized fairness attributes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation methods focus on general text generation tasks without targeting specific AI applications, which is insufficient for assessing fairness dimensions that vary across different applications.

Method: Constructed a dataset based on a real-world application (generating product descriptions from product features) parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and product categories, creating labeled prompts.

Result: The dataset enables identification of quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs, providing a concrete evaluation resource.

Conclusion: The work contributes a proposal for LLM evaluation specifically targeting Responsible AI dimensions, paired with a practical dataset for the research community.

Abstract: Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus
on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI
application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for
Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are
highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this
work, we construct a dataset that is driven by a real-world application
(generate a plain-text product description, given a list of product features),
parameterized by fairness attributes intersected with gendered adjectives and
product categories, yielding a rich set of labeled prompts. We show how to use
the data to identify quality, veracity, safety, and fairness gaps in LLMs,
contributing a proposal for LLM evaluation paired with a concrete resource for
the research community.

### [62] [Alleviating Forgetfulness of Linear Attention by Hybrid Sparse Attention and Contextualized Learnable Token Eviction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20787)
*Mutian He,Philip N. Garner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining linear attention with sparse attention mechanisms to mitigate forgetfulness in retrieval-intensive tasks while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear-attention models are efficient but suffer from forgetfulness due to finite memory, which harms performance on retrieval-intensive tasks.

Method: Propose hybrid models with token mixers including sparse attention with token eviction and query-aware native sparse attention. Introduce a novel learnable token eviction approach combined with sliding-window attention using a lightweight CNN to adaptively retain critical KV-pairs.

Result: Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive benchmarks show effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

Conclusion: The hybrid models successfully address the forgetfulness issue in linear-attention models while maintaining efficiency for retrieval-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Linear-attention models that compress the entire input sequence into a
fixed-size recurrent state offer an efficient alternative to Transformers, but
their finite memory induces forgetfulness that harms retrieval-intensive tasks.
To mitigate the issue, we explore a series of hybrid models that restore direct
access to past tokens. We interleave token mixers with intermediate time and
space complexity between linear and full attention, including sparse attention
with token eviction, and the query-aware native sparse attention. Particularly,
we propose a novel learnable token eviction approach. Combined with
sliding-window attention, an end-to-end trainable lightweight CNN aggregates
information from both past and future adjacent tokens to adaptively retain a
limited set of critical KV-pairs per head, maintaining linear attention's
constant time and space complexity. Efficient Triton kernels for the sparse
attention mechanisms are provided. Empirical evaluations on retrieval-intensive
benchmarks support the effectiveness of our approaches.

*Yair Feldman,Yoav Artzi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A simple mean-pooling approach outperforms compression-tokens for soft context compression in RAG systems, with minimal performance drop when trained for multiple compression ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational costs of using long contexts in retrieval-augmented generation with LLMs through soft context compression.

Method: Developed a lightweight mean-pooling approach and compared it with compression-tokens architecture, training compressors for multiple compression ratios.

Result: Mean-pooling consistently outperformed compression-tokens across various QA datasets, model families, scales, and compression ratios, with small performance drop when trained for multiple ratios.

Conclusion: Simple mean-pooling achieves strongest performance, but compression trade-offs are nuanced across different architectures and training regimes.

Abstract: A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated text detection faces challenges due to inconsistent definitions, diverse usage scenarios, and human edits blurring boundaries between AI and human writing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of consistent definition for "LLM-generated text" and the limitations of current detection benchmarks that fail to account for real-world complexities.

Method: Analysis of current detection approaches, highlighting how human edits and LLM influences on users complicate the detection task.

Result: Existing benchmarks inadequately address real-world conditions, leading to misunderstood numerical results and diminishing significance of detectors.

Conclusion: LLM detectors remain useful under specific conditions but should be interpreted as references rather than decisive indicators.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), many researchers
have turned their attention to detecting text generated by them. However, there
is no consistent or precise definition of their target, namely "LLM-generated
text". Differences in usage scenarios and the diversity of LLMs further
increase the difficulty of detection. What is commonly regarded as the
detecting target usually represents only a subset of the text that LLMs can
potentially produce. Human edits to LLM outputs, together with the subtle
influences that LLMs exert on their users, are blurring the line between
LLM-generated and human-written text. Existing benchmarks and evaluation
approaches do not adequately address the various conditions in real-world
detector applications. Hence, the numerical results of detectors are often
misunderstood, and their significance is diminishing. Therefore, detectors
remain useful under specific conditions, but their results should be
interpreted only as references rather than decisive indicators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid rise of photorealistic GAN-generated images poses serious challenges for image forensics and industrial systems requiring reliable content authenticity.

Method: Apply 2D DFT to transform images into Fourier domain to detect subtle periodic artifacts, then train ResNet50 neural network on these transformed images to differentiate real from synthetic images.

Result: Frequency-domain model achieves 92.8% accuracy and 0.95 AUC, significantly outperforming equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain images, revealing unique frequency-domain signatures in GAN-generated images.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen trustworthiness of industrial AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers paired with contrastive learning achieve strong 3D shape understanding from 2D images, reaching 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, overcoming CNN limitations and reducing need for labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computer vision struggles with 3D object recognition from 2D images due to CNNs' limitations in capturing shape relationships and reliance on extensive labeled data.

Method: Combines Vision Transformers with contrastive learning objectives (both supervised and self-supervised) for multi-view 3D analysis, leveraging ViTs' global shape understanding and contrastive learning's feature refinement.

Result: Achieved 90.6% accuracy on ModelNet10, demonstrating promising performance in 3D shape understanding by capturing global shape semantics and local discriminative features.

Conclusion: The empirical approach validates that ViTs with contrastive learning effectively overcome CNN limitations for 3D representation learning, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack is a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework that uses transformer-based refinement and fusion tracking to improve 3D object tracking performance without explicit motion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance transformer-based tracking methods by leveraging multimodal sensor features (camera and LiDAR) rather than relying on single-sensor approaches, addressing challenges like occlusion and viewpoint changes.

Method: Uses a two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline with multimodal BEV fusion features. Includes a temporal smoother for trajectory refinement and a fusion tracker that integrates bounding boxes with multimodal features for identity propagation.

Result: Achieves 74.7 aMOTA on nuScenes test set, reduces identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy, and outperforms previous single-sensor approaches on nuScenes and KITTI benchmarks.

Conclusion: Query-based transformer tracking methods significantly benefit from multimodal sensor features, providing an efficient framework that competes with other neural-network-based methods without requiring pretraining or large datasets.

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online Label Smoothing (OLS) improves medical image classification by dynamically adjusting soft labels during training, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy and feature learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging often produce overconfident predictions, reducing reliability in healthcare. Traditional label smoothing fails to account for class relationships.

Method: Used Online Label Smoothing (OLS) that dynamically adjusts soft labels based on model's prediction patterns. Evaluated on RadImageNet dataset with ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19 architectures.

Result: OLS consistently improved Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to hard labels, conventional label smoothing, and teacher-free knowledge distillation. Also produced more compact and well-separated feature embeddings.

Conclusion: OLS strengthens predictive performance and enhances calibration, making it a practical solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisheye cameras provide wide-area surveillance but suffer from strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution, especially near image boundaries, which degrades standard object detector performance.

Method: Uses pre and post processing pipeline to enhance detection consistency across distorted regions, trains multiple state-of-the-art detectors on fisheye imagery, and combines outputs through ensemble strategy.

Result: Achieved F1 score of 0.6366 on 2025 AI City Challenge Track 4, ranking 8th out of 62 teams.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses fisheye imagery challenges and demonstrates robust performance in traffic surveillance applications.

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a real-time render-aware filtering method for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reduce visual noise when viewing from extrapolated camera positions outside training distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS models exhibit substantial visual noise when viewed from camera positions outside training data distribution due to uncertain density, color, and geometry predictions from lack of training data.

Method: Leverages sensitivity scores from intermediate gradients to target instabilities caused by anisotropic orientations, addressing generative uncertainty without requiring retraining.

Result: Substantially improves visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing NeRF-based approaches like BayesRays, while maintaining real-time performance.

Conclusion: The proposed filter seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time, enabling high visual fidelity during free navigation outside original training viewpoints without post-hoc retraining.

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [71] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle is a hybrid two-stage framework combining physics-based modeling with machine learning to achieve quantitative transcranial ultrasound brain imaging by reconstructing accurate speed-of-sound maps under challenging conditions of skull-induced attenuation and sparse aperture acquisition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ultrasound brain imaging faces challenges due to skull-bone sound speed differences and poor probe coupling. Physics-based methods suffer from weak signals and incomplete coverage, while purely data-driven approaches produce quantitatively biased results under low SNR and sparse aperture conditions.

Method: Two-stage hybrid framework: 1) Reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) on multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments preserving structural details under low SNR; 2) Transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with graph-based attention unit (GAU) to fuse fragments into coherent SoS images. Uses partial-array acquisition with movable low-count transducer for improved feasibility.

Result: Experiments on two synthetic datasets show BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image completeness compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle demonstrates potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound brain imaging by effectively combining physical modeling with machine learning to overcome limitations of traditional approaches under challenging transcranial imaging conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive evaluation framework reveals that both text-to-image and image-to-image generative models exhibit significant cultural bias, defaulting to Global-North depictions and applying superficial cultural cues rather than context-aware changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored cultural bias in image-to-image editing systems and provide a standardized evaluation framework for diagnosing cultural misrepresentations in generative image models.

Method: Developed a unified evaluation across six countries with 8-category/36-subcategory schema and era-aware prompts, using open models with fixed settings. Combined automatic metrics, culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments from native reviewers.

Result: Three key findings: (1) models default to Global-North, modern-leaning depictions under country-agnostic prompts; (2) iterative I2I editing erodes cultural fidelity despite stable metrics; (3) I2I models apply superficial cues rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes.

Conclusion: Culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems, and the study provides a reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural bias in generative image models.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event camera image reconstruction methods typically use neural networks requiring GPUs, but a simpler, asynchronous CPU-based approach could be beneficial for certain applications.

Method: Uses temporal IIR filtering to integrate intensity changes from events, with stale pixel detection and Gaussian filtering to reduce noise based on the assumption that absence of events indicates low gradient.

Result: FIBAR runs at 42-140 million events/s on laptop CPU, produces noisier reconstructions with ghost images compared to neural networks, but is sufficient for tasks like fiducial marker detection.

Conclusion: While inferior to neural network methods in reconstruction quality, FIBAR provides a simple, efficient CPU-based alternative suitable for specific applications where neural networks are not required.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBTLRR is a novel tensor low-rank representation model that learns data-adaptive transformations and exploits bilateral tensor structure for improved image clustering with better noise robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tensor low-rank representation methods rely on fixed transformations and have poor robustness to noise, limiting their effectiveness in real-world image clustering applications.

Method: Proposes TBTLRR model with data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm using learned unitary transforms, bilateral structure to capture local correlations, and integrates ℓ₁/₂-norm and Frobenius norm regularization for noise handling. Uses ADMM-based optimization algorithm.

Result: Extensive experiments show TBTLRR achieves superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating effectiveness in handling complex noise scenarios.

Conclusion: TBTLRR provides an effective solution for tensor low-rank representation with adaptive transformations and bilateral structure, offering improved clustering performance and noise robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [76] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATConv reformulates convolution to incorporate self-attention principles (adaptive routing and lateral inhibition) while maintaining linear complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks and diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention has superior expressivity but quadratic complexity, while convolution has linear complexity but persistent performance gaps. The paper aims to understand what gives SA its edge and incorporate those principles into convolution.

Method: Proposed Attentive Convolution (ATConv) that introduces two key principles from SA: adaptive routing (dynamic position-aware filtering) and lateral inhibition (competition mechanism to suppress redundancy), while keeping 3×3 kernel size.

Result: ATConv outperforms various SA mechanisms in vision tasks. AttNet (CNN family using ATConv) achieves 84.4% ImageNet-1K accuracy with 27M parameters. In diffusion models, replacing SA with ATConv reduces FID by 0.15 with faster sampling.

Conclusion: Convolution can be fundamentally enhanced by incorporating SA's core principles while maintaining computational efficiency, bridging the performance gap between CNNs and transformers.

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

*Jiho Park,Sieun Choi,Jaeyoon Seo,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableSketcher is a novel framework that enhances diffusion models to generate high-quality hand-drawn sketches with better text-image alignment using VAE fine-tuning and a VQA-based reward function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle with synthesizing pixel-based human-drawn sketches, which represent abstract expression, due to limitations in capturing sketch characteristics and text-image alignment.

Method: Fine-tune VAE for better latent decoding of sketch characteristics, and integrate a visual question answering (VQA) based reward function for reinforcement learning to improve text-image alignment and semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments show StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity and better alignment with prompts compared to Stable Diffusion baseline. Also introduces SketchDUO dataset with instance-level sketches paired with captions and QA pairs.

Conclusion: StableSketcher successfully addresses sketch generation challenges and the SketchDUO dataset overcomes limitations of existing datasets that rely on image-label pairs.

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: BIOCAP enhances biological multimodal foundation models by using synthetic descriptive captions generated with MLLMs, improving species classification and text-image retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage descriptive captions as additional supervision for biological multimodal models, addressing the challenge of obtaining faithful, instance-specific captions at scale in organismal biology.

Method: Generate synthetic captions using multimodal large language models guided by Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples to reduce hallucination and ensure accuracy.

Result: BIOCAP captures rich semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and text-image retrieval, demonstrating the value of descriptive captions beyond labels.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions are valuable for bridging biological images with multimodal foundation models, enhancing model performance and semantic understanding.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes inverse image-based rendering - a method to generate light fields from single images using neural rendering that reconstructs light flows rather than 3D geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of traditional light field acquisition which requires computational costs or specialized devices, enabling light field generation from only single images.

Method: Uses neural rendering pipeline that stores light flow of source rays, computes relationships via cross-attention, predicts target ray colors, and iteratively generates novel views while updating occluded contents.

Result: Works well on various challenging datasets without retraining after training on synthetic data, outperforms state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Conclusion: Inverse image-based rendering successfully generates light fields from single images by reconstructing light flows, providing an efficient alternative to traditional light field acquisition methods.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LogitGap is a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that exploits the relationship between maximum logit and remaining logits to enhance ID/OOD separability, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods underexploit rich information in model's logits space, limiting their effectiveness in distinguishing in-distribution from out-of-distribution samples.

Method: Proposes LogitGap which explicitly uses the gap between maximum logit and remaining logits, plus a training-free strategy to identify most informative logits for scoring.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision-language and vision-only models show LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks.

Conclusion: LogitGap effectively leverages logit space relationships to improve OOD detection, providing both theoretical foundations and empirical validation for its superior performance.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Method: Created PartNeXt dataset with over 23,000 high-quality textured 3D models annotated with fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories, using scalable annotation methods and texture-aware labels.

Result: Benchmarking showed state-of-the-art methods struggle with fine-grained part segmentation, and 3D-LLMs have significant gaps in part-centric question answering. Training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yielded substantial improvements over PartNet.

Conclusion: PartNeXt opens new research avenues in structured 3D understanding by combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task evaluation to advance part-level understanding in 3D domains.

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like

fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task

### [83] [Monocular Visual 8D Pose Estimation for Articulated Bicycles and Cyclists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20158)
*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an 8D pose estimation method for articulated bicycles and cyclists from single RGB images, extending beyond traditional 6D pose estimation by additionally estimating steering handle and pedal rotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclists are vulnerable road users in autonomous driving, and accurate pose estimation is critical for intention classification, behavior prediction, and collision avoidance. Traditional 6D pose methods are insufficient for articulated bicycles because varying steering/pedal angles change the 3D bounding box and the orientation may not align with the actual travel direction.

Method: The proposed method jointly estimates 8D pose (3D translation, 3D rotation, plus steering handle and pedal rotations) and 3D keypoints of articulated bicycles. It uses a mix of synthetic and real image data for training to generalize on real images.

Result: The method shows promising results by achieving competitive scores compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: The 8D pose estimation approach enables more fine-grained bicycle pose state and travel direction estimation, which is crucial for autonomous driving applications involving cyclists.

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel approach for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that uses multimodal prototype updating with adaptive weights and dynamic priority queues to handle distribution shifts during testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CZSL methods suffer from performance degradation due to distribution shift of label space at test time when unseen attribute-object compositions are introduced.

Method: Accumulates comprehensive knowledge from textual and visual modalities using unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes, with adaptive update weights and dynamic priority queues for high-confidence image storage and visual knowledge acquisition.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively overcomes the distribution shift challenge in CZSL through multimodal prototype updating and collaborative representation learning.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve disentangled representation learning in GANs by applying Information Bottleneck framework to constrain mutual information between input and generated output, addressing limitations of existing methods like InfoGAN.

Method: Proposes IB-GAN with architecture similar to InfoGAN but uses an intermediate stochastic layer in the generator to constrain mutual information between input and output. The latent distribution is trained jointly with generator in end-to-end fashion.

Result: IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores to state-of-the-art β-VAEs on dSprites and Color-dSprites datasets, outperforms InfoGAN. Shows better visual quality and diversity in samples on CelebA and 3D Chairs datasets with improved FID scores.

Conclusion: IB-GAN successfully applies Information Bottleneck to GAN optimization, enabling better disentangled and interpretable latent space while maintaining high sample quality and diversity compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

TL;DR: PPMStereo introduces a Pick-and-Play Memory module for temporally consistent stereo depth estimation from video, achieving efficient long-range temporal modeling through a two-stage frame selection and weighting process.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for real-world applications like AR, but existing methods face a trade-off between limited temporal modeling and high computational costs for long-range dependencies.

Method: Proposes a Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM) module with two stages: 'pick' process identifies the most relevant frames, and 'play' process weights selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal aggregation, maintaining a compact yet informative memory buffer.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.62/1.11 TEPE on Sintel clean/final (17.3% & 9.02% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer computational costs.

Conclusion: PPMStereo effectively addresses the temporal consistency challenge in stereo video depth estimation through efficient long-range spatio-temporal modeling while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

*Aaron Appelle,Jerome P. Lynch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video and image-to-video models as simulators of pedestrian dynamics, revealing that current models have learned effective priors for multi-agent behavior but still exhibit failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes with multiple interacting people, leaving the plausibility of multi-agent dynamics unverified despite the potential of video generation models as world simulators.

Method: Developed an evaluation protocol for T2V and I2V models using start frames from established datasets for I2V comparison and a prompt suite for T2V to explore pedestrian densities and interactions. Key innovation is a method to reconstruct 2D bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.

Result: Analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective priors for plausible multi-agent behavior, but also exhibit failure modes like merging and disappearing people.

Conclusion: Current video generation models show promise as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics but require further improvement to address identified failure modes in multi-agent interactions.

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

*Xinyi Hu,Yuran Wang,Yue Li,Wenxuan Liu,Zheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPAN proposes continuous regression for temporal intention localization instead of discrete classification, modeling suspicion as a continuous process with long-term dependencies using Temporal Point Process theory and multimodal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing discrete classification methods fail to capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early intervention and explainability in video surveillance systems.

Method: SPAN uses continuous regression with suspicion score formula based on Temporal Point Process theory, Suspicion Coefficient Modulation with multimodal information, and Concept-Anchored Mapping to link actions to intention concepts.

Result: SPAN reduces MSE by 19.8% and improves average mAP by 1.78% on HAI dataset, with 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes.

Conclusion: Continuous suspicion modeling enables earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system explainability and practical utility in security applications compared to discrete classification systems.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: Analysis of 54 public brain MRI datasets reveals significant data heterogeneity and preprocessing variability that persists even after harmonization, highlighting the need for domain-adaptive approaches in foundation model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically assess the scale, diversity, and consistency of public brain MRI data for foundation model development, as systematic evaluations of these critical factors are scarce.

Method: Multi-level analysis of 54 datasets (538,031+ scans): dataset-level characterization of modality and disease coverage; image-level quantification of voxel spacing, orientation, and intensity distributions; evaluation of preprocessing variability; and feature-space analysis using 3D DenseNet121.

Result: Revealed strong imbalances between healthy and clinical cohorts, substantial heterogeneity in imaging characteristics, persistent residual differences after preprocessing, and measurable covariate shift even after standardized harmonization.

Conclusion: Public brain MRI resources exhibit significant variability that harmonization alone cannot eliminate, necessitating preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies for developing generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

*Bingjie Gao,Qianli Ma,Xiaoxue Wu,Shuai Yang,Guanzhou Lan,Haonan Zhao,Jiaxuan Chen,Qingyang Liu,Yu Qiao,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Li Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPO++ is a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that improves text-to-video generation by refining user prompts through retrieval-augmented optimization, iterative scaling with multi-source feedback, and LLM fine-tuning, achieving superior video quality without modifying the underlying generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: User-provided prompts for text-to-video generation are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with training data, limiting the potential of diffusion-based models. This creates a need for systematic prompt optimization to enhance generation quality.

Method: Three-stage framework: Stage 1 uses retrieval-augmented prompt optimization to enrich prompts with relevant modifiers and refactor them to match training distributions. Stage 2 employs sample-specific prompt optimization with iterative refinement using multi-source feedback. Stage 3 fine-tunes LLMs using optimized prompt pairs to internalize optimization patterns.

Result: Extensive experiments across five state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks show significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning, temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods by large margins.

Conclusion: RAPO++ provides a model-agnostic, cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt optimization in text-to-video generation, enabling high-quality video generation without modifying the underlying generative backbone.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

### [91] [FlowCycle: Pursuing Cycle-Consistent Flows for Text-based Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20212)
*Yanghao Wang,Zhen Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowCycle is a novel text-to-image editing framework that uses target-aware intermediate states and cycle-consistent optimization to achieve better editing quality and consistency compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-based image editing methods use target-agnostic intermediate states that focus on source reconstruction but neglect semantic gaps towards specific editing targets, resulting in limited editability and inconsistency when modifications deviate substantially from the source.

Method: FlowCycle parameterizes corruption with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process with dual consistency constraints, iteratively editing source to target and recovering back to source to produce target-aware intermediate states.

Result: Extensive ablations demonstrate that FlowCycle achieves superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed target-aware intermediate state approach enables faithful modifications while preserving source consistency, addressing limitations of current corruption-then-restoration paradigms in text-to-image editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: CURL is a self-supervised contrastive learning framework for detecting fetal movements from ultrasound videos, achieving 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on 92 subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fetal movement detection methods like maternal perception and cardiotocography are subjective and inaccurate, creating need for objective prenatal monitoring.

Method: Uses dual-contrastive loss with spatial and temporal contrastive learning, task-specific sampling strategy, and probabilistic fine-tuning for long recordings.

Result: Achieved 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on 92 subjects with 30-minute ultrasound sessions each.

Conclusion: Self-supervised contrastive learning shows strong potential for reliable fetal movement analysis, enabling improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

TL;DR: EditInfinity adapts VQ-based generative models for text-driven image editing by leveraging exact intermediate quantized representations for precise image inversion, outperforming diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based image editing methods suffer from approximation errors during image inversion due to lack of exact supervision in intermediate steps. VQ-based models can provide exact intermediate representations for more effective supervision.

Method: Proposes EditInfinity which adapts Infinity (binary-quantized generative model) with efficient image inversion mechanism integrating text prompting rectification and style preservation, plus holistic smoothing strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench across add, change, and delete operations demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: VQ-based generative models with exact intermediate representations enable more precise image inversion and editing, achieving better fidelity to source images and semantic alignment with text prompts than diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an 'induce-detect-suppress' framework to address hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models, showing that hallucinations in longer responses stem from increased context reliance rather than length itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models suffer from hallucination issues, particularly in longer free-form responses, and the authors aim to understand whether this is due to length-induced errors or deeper mechanisms related to context reliance.

Method: An 'induce-detect-suppress' framework that actively induces hallucinations through designed contexts, uses induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases, and suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during decoding.

Result: The approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all benchmarks, demonstrating strong detection capabilities and improved hallucination mitigation.

Conclusion: The study validates that hallucinations in longer responses are caused by increased context reliance rather than length itself, providing new insights for deeper exploration of LVLM hallucinations.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods either rely on a single 3D language field (leading to inferior segmentation) or pre-computed class-agnostic segmentations (suffering from error accumulation), creating limitations in open-vocabulary 3D segmentation.

Method: Proposes a collaborative field with instance and language fields, uses instance-to-language feature mapping with two-stage training strategy, and implements adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement during inference.

Result: COS3D achieves leading performance on two widely-used benchmarks and demonstrates high potential for various applications including novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical segmentation, and robotics.

Conclusion: The collaborative prompt-segmentation framework effectively integrates complementary language and segmentation cues, overcoming limitations of existing methods and showing strong performance across multiple applications.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualGround is a dual-branch architecture for Video Temporal Grounding that separates global and local semantics by routing [EOS] tokens through sentence-level paths and clustering word tokens into phrase-level units, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VTG approaches treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention, disregarding their distinct semantic roles. Controlled experiments show VTG models overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively utilize word-level signals, limiting fine-grained temporal alignment.

Method: Proposes DualGround with: (1) token-role-aware cross-modal interaction strategies that align video features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in structurally disentangled manner, (2) joint modeling framework that improves global sentence-level alignment and enhances fine-grained temporal grounding using structured phrase-aware context.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across QVHighlights and Charades-STA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment through DualGround's dual-branch architecture effectively captures both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive and context-aware video grounding.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

TL;DR: EDGeo introduces mask-based positional encoding and context enhancement for cross-view object geo-localization, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 3.39% accuracy improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods use keypoint-based positional encoding that only captures 2D coordinates, ignoring object shape information, leading to sensitivity to annotation shifts and limited cross-view matching capability.

Method: Proposes mask-based positional encoding (MPE) to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes, and a context enhancement module (CEM) with horizontal/vertical strip convolutional kernels for handling large-span objects in satellite imagery.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CVOGL and VIGOR-Building datasets with 3.39% improvement in localization accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios.

Conclusion: Provides a robust positional encoding paradigm and contextual modeling framework that advances cross-view geo-localization research by making models object-aware rather than just location-aware.

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

TL;DR: CMC model addresses multimodal emotion recognition challenges by mitigating text dominance and handling semantic inconsistencies across modalities through pseudo label generation and parameter-free fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MER approaches neglect semantic inconsistencies across modalities and are dominated by text modality, compromising recognition accuracy.

Method: CMC uses Pseudo Label Generation Module for self-supervised unimodal pretraining, then Parameter-free Fusion Module and Multimodal Consensus Router for multimodal finetuning to achieve balanced fusion.

Result: CMC achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI) and shows notable advantages in handling semantic inconsistencies.

Conclusion: CMC effectively mitigates text dominance and guides multimodal fusion toward reliable consensus, improving emotion recognition accuracy especially in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

### [100] [GMFVAD: Using Grained Multi-modal Feature to Improve Video Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20268)
*Guangyu Dai,Dong Chen,Siliang Tang,Yueting Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GMFVAD is a video anomaly detection method that uses fine-grained multi-modal features to reduce redundancy in visual features by incorporating text features from video captions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods incorporate text features coarsely and overlook redundant information in video snippets. The goal is to leverage multi-modal diversity to refine features and reduce redundancy.

Method: Generate fine-grained multi-modal features by summarizing video snippet content and incorporating text features from video captions to enhance visual features of highlighted portions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four main datasets. Ablation experiments confirm improvement is due to reduced redundant information.

Conclusion: GMFVAD effectively reduces feature redundancy through fine-grained multi-modal integration, leading to superior video anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

*Jiayi Zou,Gengyun Jia,Bing-Kun Bao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses bias in Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) datasets and proposes a debiasing method using backdoor adjustment to improve model generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VCR methods achieve high accuracy but overlook dataset biases and lack debiasing strategies, limiting model generalization capabilities.

Method: Introduced VCR-OOD datasets for evaluation, analyzed causal graphs and prediction shortcuts, and applied backdoor adjustment method with a dictionary-based approach to remove bias.

Result: Experiments showed the debiasing method effectively improves model performance across different datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed debiasing approach successfully addresses bias issues in VCR and enhances model generalization through causal intervention.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

*Haodong Yang,Zhongling Huang,Shaojie Guo,Zhe Zhang,Gong Cheng,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KINN is a lightweight neural network framework that resolves the representation trilemma in CV-SAR image recognition by combining physics-guided compression, aggregation, and semantic compression with self-distillation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency, generalization, and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the conflicting optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency in deep learning models for CV-SAR image recognition under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios by better harnessing the rich electromagnetic scattering features inherent in CV-SAR data.

Method: Proposes KINN with a "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture: physics-guided compression using a dictionary processor to embed physical priors and extract sparse signatures, aggregation to enrich representations, and semantic compression with a compact classification head and self-distillation.

Result: KINN establishes state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition on five SAR benchmarks, offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios with tangible interpretability, using only 0.7M (CNN) and 0.95M (ViT) parameters.

Conclusion: KINN provides an effective solution to the representation trilemma in SAR image analysis and offers a new path for trustworthy AI by combining physical priors with efficient neural architectures.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

TL;DR: Proposes DMC³ framework for Egocentric VideoQA using counterfactual sample construction and contrastive optimization to address first-person perspective challenges like multiple events and hand-object interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods ignore unique challenges of first-person perspective in egocentric videos, such as understanding multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions.

Method: Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction (DMC³) framework with counterfactual sample generation through event description paraphrasing (textual) and core interaction mining (visual), followed by contrastive optimization.

Result: Achieves 52.51% on normal split and 46.04% on indirect split of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2% on QAEGO4D, reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The proposed DMC³ framework effectively addresses first-person perspective challenges in Egocentric VideoQA and achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior works treat instructions as static proxies for user intent, overlooking instruction diversity and quality impact. Found 23.3% flaw rate in existing datasets and showed instruction diversity can yield 76% performance improvement.

Method: Two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on synthesized diverse instructions for multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning to optimize pathway selection and composition.

Result: UI-Ins-7B and UI-Ins-32B achieve SOTA on five grounding benchmarks: 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. UI-Ins-7B achieves 74.1% success rate on AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm enables emergent reasoning, selective pathway composition, and mitigates policy collapse. Models demonstrate strong agentic potential and enhanced grounding performance through dynamic instruction analysis.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome severe inter-platform heterogeneity and domain gaps between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries in cross-modal geo-localization tasks.

Method: Uses domain-aligned preprocessing (platform-wise partitioning, satellite augmentation, orientation word removal) and LLM-based caption refinement, then trains three platform experts using BGE-M3 and EVA-CLIP with progressive two-stage hard-negative mining, fusing scores at inference.

Result: The system achieved top performance on the official RoboSense 2025 Track 4 leaderboard, demonstrating robust cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

Conclusion: The proposed domain-aligned preprocessing and Mixture-of-Experts framework effectively addresses platform heterogeneity and domain gaps in cross-modal geo-localization, providing a robust solution for drone navigation tasks.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language
query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap
between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework: (i) platform-wise partitioning, satellite
augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

*Zelin Peng,Zhengqin Xu,Qingyang Liu,Xiaokang Yang,Wei Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET is an efficient training paradigm for multi-modal large language models that uses hyperbolic space to align visual and textual representations at arbitrary granularity levels, achieving significant improvements with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs require massive computational resources due to vision encoders like CLIP and SAM lacking proper multi-granularity alignment with language. The granularity gap between visual and textual modalities causes training inefficiency.

Method: Leverages hyperbolic space to model hierarchical levels and bridge the granularity gap. Uses dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment and learnable matrices with Möbius multiplication operations implemented through diagonal scaling, block-diagonal, and banded matrices.

Result: Consistently improves existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs across multiple benchmarks with less than 1% additional parameters.

Conclusion: HyperET provides an efficient parametrization strategy that enables better cross-modal alignment at arbitrary granularity levels, addressing the computational inefficiency in current MLLM training approaches.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyPcc introduces a universal point cloud compression framework with a Universal Context Model for robust contextual dependencies and Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning to handle out-of-distribution data, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 15 diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the generalization challenge in deep learning-based point cloud geometry compression, which stems from lack of robust context models and inefficient handling of out-of-distribution data.

Method: Two key components: 1) Universal Context Model using spatial and channel-wise grouping priors to capture contextual dependencies, 2) Instance-Adaptive Fine-Tuning strategy that fine-tunes a small subset of network weights per instance and includes them in the bitstream.

Result: Extensive experiments on 15 diverse datasets confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression.

Conclusion: AnyPcc provides an effective solution for universal point cloud compression with strong generalization capabilities, and the code/datasets will be released for reproducible research.

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

*Seunghoon Lee,Jeongwoo Choi,Byunggwan Son,Jaehyeon Moon,Jeimin Jeon,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AccuQuant is a novel post-training quantization method for diffusion models that minimizes accumulated quantization errors over multiple denoising steps, reducing memory complexity from O(n) to O(1).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization errors in diffusion models accumulate over denoising steps during sampling, degrading performance. Previous approaches only minimize errors independently for each step without considering error accumulation.

Method: AccuQuant simulates multiple denoising steps explicitly for quantization, minimizing discrepancies between full-precision and quantized model outputs across multiple steps. It uses an efficient implementation with a novel objective that reduces memory complexity.

Result: The method demonstrates efficacy and efficiency across various tasks and diffusion models on standard benchmarks, successfully addressing the error accumulation problem.

Conclusion: AccuQuant effectively reduces quantization error accumulation in diffusion models through multi-step optimization while maintaining computational efficiency with reduced memory requirements.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field) to enhance Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by extending positional encodings from 2D to 3D, enabling better 3D geometry modeling and achieving SOTA in novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors discovered that DiTs' patch tokens are surprisingly independent and spatial coherence is primarily governed by positional encodings, motivating the extension to 3D positional encoding fields.

Method: Proposed PE-Field that extends positional encodings from 2D plane to structured 3D field with depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for sub-patch control.

Result: PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image editing.

Conclusion: Extending positional encodings to 3D fields enables DiTs to better model geometry in 3D space, improving performance on 3D-aware tasks while maintaining strong 2D capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

### [111] [Mitigating Cross-modal Representation Bias for Multicultural Image-to-Recipe Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20393)
*Qing Wang,Chong-Wah Ngo,Yu Cao,Ee-Peng Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a causal approach for image-to-recipe retrieval that predicts overlooked culinary elements in images and injects them into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume food images fully capture recipe details, but images only show the visual outcome, missing crucial recipe-specific details like subtle ingredients and cooking methods, especially problematic with diverse cuisines.

Method: A novel causal approach that predicts culinary elements potentially overlooked in images and explicitly injects these elements into cross-modal representation learning to mitigate biases.

Result: The method achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural cuisine dataset, successfully uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions.

Conclusion: Causal representation learning effectively addresses the modality gap in image-to-recipe retrieval by capturing subtle culinary details that are not visually apparent but crucial for accurate recipe matching.

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

*Saif Ur Rehman Khan,Muhammad Nabeel Asim,Sebastian Vollmer,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet uses dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation for lung cancer classification, dynamically adjusting distillation weights to handle uncertainty and improve student model performance across CT-scan and histopathological images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional static knowledge distillation methods with fixed weights cannot effectively handle uncertainty and complexity in lung cancer diagnosis, leading to suboptimal performance on ambiguous regions of medical images.

Method: Uses Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as teacher and MobileNet as student with dynamic fuzzy logic for weight adjustment, combined with image fusion techniques (Gamma correction, Histogram Equalization, wavelet fusion) and Genetic Algorithm for model selection.

Result: Achieved 99.16% accuracy on LC25000 histopathological images and 99.54% accuracy on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images, demonstrating robust performance across different imaging modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed dynamic fuzzy logic-driven knowledge distillation approach effectively handles uncertainty in medical images and achieves state-of-the-art performance for lung cancer classification across multiple datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conan is a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step video reasoning that identifies contextual/evidence frames, reasons over cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video reasoning methods face challenges: RL-based approaches yield ungrounded conclusions, while frame-retrieval methods struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. There's a need for evidence-grounded multi-step reasoning that combines visual grounding with accurate reasoning.

Method: Conan framework with (1) Conan-91K dataset of automatically generated reasoning traces including frame identification, evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) multi-stage progressive cold-start strategy combined with Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework.

Result: Conan surpasses baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by average of over 10% in accuracy on six multi-step reasoning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Also generalizes effectively to long-video understanding tasks.

Conclusion: Conan demonstrates strong scalability and robustness for video reasoning, effectively addressing the limitations of existing methods by providing evidence-grounded multi-step reasoning with adaptive decision-making.

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

### [114] [Reliable and Reproducible Demographic Inference for Fairness in Face Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20482)
*Alexandre Fournier-Montgieux,Hervé Le Borgne,Adrian Popescu,Bertrand Luvison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a modular transfer learning approach for demographic attribute inference to improve fairness evaluation in face analysis systems, introducing a new robustness metric based on intra-identity consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness auditing in face analysis systems depends on demographic attribute inference, but current methods have reliability issues that affect fairness estimates. Improved DAI reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance fairness assessments.

Method: A fully reproducible DAI pipeline using modular transfer learning with pretrained face recognition encoders and non-linear classification heads, evaluated across accuracy, fairness, and a new robustness metric based on intra-identity consistency.

Result: The proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on the more challenging ethnicity attribute, across multiple datasets and training setups.

Conclusion: This work provides a reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing and promotes transparency through public release of datasets, code, models, and evaluation tools.

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoDistill enables one-step diffusion personalization through bidirectional concept distillation between multi-step teacher and one-step student models, improving both personalization quality and generation speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-step diffusion models struggle with personalizing novel concepts due to limited capacity, while multi-step models are slow. There's a need for fast personalization that maintains quality.

Method: End-to-end training with bidirectional concept distillation: teacher distills concepts to student, student echoes back to teacher. Shared text encoder, adversarial losses, alignment losses, and bidirectional echoing refinement strategy.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing personalization methods in 1-SDP setup, enhances both student's personalization ability and teacher's generative quality.

Conclusion: Establishes a novel paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models through collaborative bidirectional distillation.

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

*Xiaohan Lan,Fanfan Liu,Haibo Qiu,Siqi Yang,Delian Ruan,Peng Shi,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Metis-HOME is a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework that enables 'Hybrid Thinking' by splitting a dense model into thinking and non-thinking expert branches with a dynamic router, resolving the trade-off between specialized reasoning and general capabilities in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning models suffer from computational inefficiency on simple queries and impaired general understanding due to over-specialization in complex reasoning, creating a reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Method: Adapt Qwen2.5-VL-7B into a Mixture-of-Experts architecture with two expert branches: thinking branch for complex multi-step reasoning and non-thinking branch for rapid direct inference, plus a lightweight trainable router for dynamic query allocation.

Result: The approach substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities while improving general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend seen in other reasoning-specialized models.

Conclusion: Metis-HOME establishes a new paradigm for building powerful and versatile MLLMs that effectively resolves the reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma through hybrid thinking.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

*Lixiong Qin,Yang Zhang,Mei Wang,Jiani Hu,Weihong Deng,Weiran Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes FiFa framework for fine-grained explainable deepfake analysis, addressing limitations in current MLLMs through better data annotation and model architecture that connects textual explanations with visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs for deepfake analysis lack fine-grained awareness - unreliable coarse-grained annotations, inability to connect textual explanations with visual evidence, and no support for arbitrary facial region queries.

Method: Proposes FiFa framework with two main components: 1) FiFa-Annotator using Facial Image Concept Tree for reliable fine-grained data annotation, and 2) FiFa-MLLM architecture for multi-task learning supporting multimodal inputs/outputs and Artifact-Grounding Explanation task.

Result: FiFa-MLLM outperforms strong baselines on AGE task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on existing XDFA datasets.

Conclusion: The FiFa framework successfully addresses fine-grained explainable deepfake analysis limitations through improved data annotation and unified model architecture, enabling better grounding of explanations in visual context.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that jointly estimates sharp images and camera motion trajectories from blurry images, achieving state-of-the-art performance on severe blur cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera shake, especially under large or rotational movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration that existing methods struggle with.

Method: Uses a differentiable blur creation module based on Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), predicts 3D rotation trajectory with neural network, and trains model-based restoration network end-to-end with post-inference trajectory optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real datasets, particularly effective for severe or spatially variant blur where end-to-end deblurring networks fail.

Conclusion: The proposed modular architecture provides interpretable camera motion estimation and enables reconstruction of sharp image sequences, offering superior performance for challenging blur scenarios.

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Motivation: Consumer cameras struggle with complex illumination conditions like low light, high dynamic range, and backlighting, leading to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency that degrade downstream vision tasks.

Method: A two-module framework: ACamera-Exposure estimates ISO to handle underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for color consistency. Optimized for real-time edge device inference and trained on diverse real-world data.

Result: Extensive experiments show ACamera-Net consistently enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without additional image enhancement modules.

Conclusion: ACamera-Net provides an effective solution for camera parameter adjustment that generalizes well across lighting conditions and can be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines for improved visual quality and perception stability.

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,

lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the

ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW

estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video introduces explicit spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning by highlighting key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside answers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on video understanding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most video reasoning models generate only textual reasoning traces without indicating when and where key evidence appears, making it challenging to extend evidence-centered reasoning from images to videos due to the need for joint temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes.

Method: The framework uses a non-agent approach with two curated datasets (STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL) with unified spatio-temporal annotations, and employs cold-start reinforcement learning with multiple rewards for answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.

Result: On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance, raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on Qwen2.5-VL baseline, with consistent improvements on VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench.

Conclusion: The model enables reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations and provides valuable signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and improving answer reliability through its explicit spatio-temporal evidence traces.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with fine-grained color controllability and existing benchmarks lack systematic color precision assessment, despite color being fundamental to visual perception and critical for applications requiring brand consistency.

Method: Created GenColorBench with 44K color-focused prompts covering 400+ colors, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11, including numerical colors. Uses both perceptual and automated assessments to evaluate models.

Result: Evaluations of popular text-to-image models reveal performance variations, showing which color conventions models understand best and identifying specific failure modes in color generation.

Conclusion: GenColorBench provides the first systematic framework for assessing color precision in text-to-image generation and will guide improvements in precise color generation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: Proposes a similarity-based prototype framework for cross-modality segmentation that learns class-wise prototypes with similarity constraints and uses dictionaries to store prototypes for contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models suffer performance degradation on unseen data due to domain shift, and unsupervised domain adaptation aims to reduce domain gap without costly annotation.

Method: Learn class-wise prototypes in embedding space with similarity constraints, use dictionaries to store prototypes from different images to prevent class-missing and enable contrastive learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses cross-modality segmentation through similarity-based prototypes and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: OnlineSplatter is an online feed-forward framework that reconstructs free-moving objects from monocular video without requiring camera poses, depth priors, or bundle optimization, using 3D Gaussians and a dual-key memory module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video is challenging without reliable pose/depth cues and under arbitrary object motion. Existing methods often require camera poses, depth priors, or bundle optimization.

Method: Anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines object representation through dense Gaussian primitive field. Uses dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry keys with explicit directional keys to fuse current frame features with temporally aggregated object states.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines on real-world datasets, consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory and runtime.

Conclusion: OnlineSplatter enables high-quality, object-centric 3D reconstruction from monocular video without pose/depth requirements, with constant computational cost regardless of video length through efficient memory design.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

### [127] [SeViCES: Unifying Semantic-Visual Evidence Consensus for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20622)
*Yuan Sheng,Yanbin Hao,Chenxu Li,Shuo Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeViCES is a training-free framework for long video understanding that selects informative frames through semantic-visual consensus and refines answers by fusing evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video understanding is challenging due to complex content, computational limitations of Video-LLMs, and limitations of existing frame selection methods that ignore temporal dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence.

Method: Two key components: 1) Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection with temporal-aware semantic branch using LLM reasoning and cluster-guided visual branch aligning embeddings via mutual information, 2) Answer Consensus Refinement that fuses evidence and constrains answer space to resolve inconsistencies.

Result: Extensive experiments show SeViCES consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness on long video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Consensus-driven evidence selection is crucial for effective Video-LLMs in long video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTB3D introduces a causal convolutional encoder-decoder for 3D medical imaging that improves vision-language modeling through better volumetric tokenization, achieving state-of-the-art results in report generation and text-to-CT synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches struggle with high-resolution, long-sequence 3D medical volumes due to misaligned vision encoders and slice-wise tokenization that blurs fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance.

Method: A three-stage training curriculum with causal convolutional encoder-decoder: (i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii) long-context decoder refinement, producing compact frequency-aware volumetric tokens.

Result: BTB3D improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% for report generation, and reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically consistent 512*512*241 volumes.

Conclusion: Precise three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UltraHR-100K dataset and a frequency-aware post-training method to address ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation challenges, improving fine-grained detail quality in 3K+ resolution images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in ultra-high-resolution T2I generation: lack of large-scale high-quality UHR datasets and insufficient training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios.

Method: Proposes UltraHR-100K dataset (100K 3K+ resolution images) and frequency-aware post-training with Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS) and Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR) using Discrete Fourier Transform.

Result: Extensive experiments on UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks show significant improvements in fine-grained detail quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses UHR T2I generation challenges through a curated dataset and specialized training strategy, achieving superior detail preservation in ultra-high-resolution images.

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

*Jinhee Kim,Jae Jun An,Kang Eun Jeon,Jong Hwan Ko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques (weight bias correction and bit-wise coreset sampling) to reduce training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-bit quantization approaches suffer from significant training overhead due to repeated full-dataset updates for each bit-width and extra fine-tuning stages, making training costs scale linearly with precision options.

Method: 1) Weight bias correction enables shared batch normalization by neutralizing quantization-induced bias across bit-widths. 2) Bit-wise coreset sampling allows each child model to train on compact, informative subsets using gradient-based importance scores.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with ResNet and ViT architectures show competitive or superior accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively reduces training overhead in multi-bit quantization networks without compromising model utility, achieving significant speedup while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Motivation: Current multimodal large language models exhibit visual hallucinations and over-reliance on textual priors despite using chain-of-thought prompting, requiring systematic diagnosis and improved visual reasoning capabilities.

Method: Proposes an agent-based architecture that combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains for visual tasks.

Result: Achieves significant performance gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline) and matches or surpasses much larger models.

Conclusion: Future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating specialized tools for visual content analysis, and the framework will be released to facilitate research.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant

surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

*Xuyang Liu,Xiyan Gui,Yuchao Zhang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV is a novel KV cache compression method for large vision-language models that combines importance and diversity metrics to address modality-specific semantic redundancy, achieving significant performance improvements under extreme compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods focus only on importance metrics, overlooking modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns in multi-modal KV caches, which limits their effectiveness in large vision-language models.

Method: MixKV adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy by selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs, addressing the limitations of importance-only approaches.

Result: Under extreme compression (budget=64), MixKV improves baseline methods by 5.1% across five multi-modal benchmarks and achieves 8.0-9.0% gains for GUI grounding tasks, while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.

Conclusion: MixKV effectively addresses KV cache memory bottlenecks in LVLMs by considering both importance and diversity, demonstrating consistent performance improvements and seamless extension to LLMs.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI is a sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from spinning LiDAR point clouds by automatically reverse-engineering intrinsic sensor parameters, enabling complete point cloud reconstruction with zero point loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional LiDAR projection methods suffer from geometric inconsistencies causing irreversible information loss, compromising high-fidelity applications in autonomous navigation and remote sensing.

Method: Automatically reverse-engineers intrinsic geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam calibration corrections.

Result: Achieves perfect point preservation with zero points lost across all point clouds in KITTI and DurLAR datasets, maintaining geometric accuracy within sensor precision limits with real-time performance.

Conclusion: This paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete geometric preservation.

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To generate realistic and geometrically consistent long-horizon driving videos, addressing challenges in maintaining geometric consistency over extended sequences.

Method: Uses an RGB-D diffusion model that jointly handles image and depth in shared latent space, conditions on existing scene geometry from previous keyframes, and employs warp-consistent guidance. Then interpolates keyframes with video diffusion.

Result: Generates realistic driving videos over 20 seconds, improving long-horizon FID by 48.6% and FVD by 43.0% over prior state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: AutoScape effectively addresses long-horizon driving scene generation with geometric consistency through its RGB-D diffusion approach and keyframe interpolation strategy.

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyPE is a training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to generate ultra-high-resolution images beyond their training resolution by dynamically adjusting positional encodings based on the diffusion process frequency spectrum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training diffusion transformers at ultra-high resolutions is extremely costly due to quadratic scaling of self-attention, creating a need for methods that can extend resolution capabilities without retraining.

Method: Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE) adjusts positional encodings at each diffusion step to match the frequency spectrum of the current generative stage, leveraging the spectral progression where low-frequency structures converge early and high-frequencies take more steps.

Result: Enables generation at resolutions far beyond training data (e.g., 16 million pixels with FLUX), achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation, with performance gains increasing at higher resolutions.

Conclusion: DyPE provides an effective training-free solution for extending diffusion transformers to ultra-high resolutions by dynamically adapting positional encodings to the diffusion process spectral progression.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Motivation: To address the optimization conflicts and slow convergence in MeanFlow caused by the negative correlation between trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency components.

Method: Introduces α-Flow, a unified formulation that adopts a curriculum strategy to smoothly transition from trajectory flow matching to MeanFlow, disentangling conflicting objectives.

Result: α-Flow consistently outperforms MeanFlow across scales and settings on ImageNet-1K 256x256, achieving state-of-the-art FID scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE) with vanilla DiT backbones.

Conclusion: The α-Flow framework successfully resolves optimization conflicts in MeanFlow through curriculum learning, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in few-step generative modeling.

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

*Binbin Huang,Haobin Duan,Yiqun Zhao,Zibo Zhao,Yi Ma,Shenghua Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cupid is a novel 3D reconstruction method that jointly estimates camera pose, 3D shape, and texture from a single 2D image using a conditional sampling approach with flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate 3D reconstruction from single images by addressing the joint estimation of camera pose, shape, and texture under a unified generative framework.

Method: Uses a two-stage flow matching pipeline: coarse stage for initial geometry and pose recovery, and refinement stage with pose-aligned image features to enhance structural and appearance details.

Result: Outperforms leading methods with over 3 dB PSNR gain and over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching monocular pose estimators and delivering superior visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Cupid provides an effective unified framework for joint 3D reconstruction from single images, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

*Lei Cheng,Siyang Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A radar-camera fusion MOT framework that uses online calibration and common features to enhance tracking efficiency with minimal manual intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing studies underutilize radar despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information in 3D coordinates, assigning it only a supplementary role.

Method: Uses online radar-camera calibration with common features, feature matching, and category-consistency checking to associate detections from both sensors and derive real-world object positions.

Result: The framework streamlines radar-camera mapping process and improves tracking precision, as demonstrated in real-world experiments in controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: This is the first work to investigate radar-camera common features integration with online calibration for MOT, achieving enhanced tracking efficiency and reduced manual interventions.

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

*Xiaolong Wang,Lixiang Ru,Ziyuan Huang,Kaixiang Ji,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGenSeg is a novel autoregressive generation-based paradigm for image segmentation that unifies multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved inference speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior MLLM segmentation methods using boundary points or dedicated segmentation heads rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts, limiting fine-grained visual detail capture. The authors aim to overcome these limitations through a generation-based approach.

Method: The framework leverages MLLMs to output visual tokens and detokenizes them into images using a universal VQ-VAE, making segmentation fully dependent on MLLM's pixel-level understanding. A next-scale-prediction strategy is used to generate visual tokens in parallel for reduced inference latency.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with remarkable boost in inference speed, while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: ARGenSeg successfully integrates image segmentation into MLLMs through a generation-based paradigm, achieving superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

*Dean L Slack,G Thomas Hudson,Thomas Winterbottom,Noura Al Moubayed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simple transformer-based model for autoregressive video prediction that achieves longer physically accurate predictions than latent-space approaches while maintaining video quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches in causal modeling of physical simulations over time, and to explore spatiotemporal reasoning through physical object tracking.

Method: Simple end-to-end transformer adaptation for video prediction using continuous pixel-space representations, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts without complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components.

Result: Extends time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% compared to existing latent-space approaches while maintaining comparable video quality metrics. Also enables accurate estimation of PDE simulation parameters.

Conclusion: Provides a platform for attention-based spatiotemporal video modeling through a simple, parameter-efficient, and interpretable approach that generalizes well.

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

TL;DR: SV is a training-free framework that uses multiple lightweight draft experts to generate diverse reasoning paths and a strong verdict model to synthesize them, achieving improved performance on information-intensive visual question answering tasks with computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large VLMs struggle with information-intensive images that densely interleave text and graphical elements, facing challenges in precise localization of critical cues and multi-hop reasoning to integrate dispersed evidence.

Method: Speculative Verdict combines multiple lightweight draft experts (small VLMs) that generate diverse reasoning paths with a strong verdict model that synthesizes these paths to produce final answers. It includes a consensus expert selection mechanism to forward only high-agreement paths to the verdict stage.

Result: SV achieves consistent gains on challenging benchmarks including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K, demonstrating both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large proprietary models or training pipelines.

Conclusion: By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning paths, SV effectively addresses the challenges of information-intensive visual reasoning while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large

### [145] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectraMorph is a physics-guided self-supervised framework for hyperspectral super-resolution that uses an unmixing bottleneck to fuse low-resolution HSI with high-resolution MSI, producing interpretable intermediates and remaining robust even with single-band MSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral sensors have low spatial resolution causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects, while co-registered companion sensors provide high-resolution spatial detail. Existing deep learning methods lack interpretability and fail when MSI has very few bands.

Method: Enforces an unmixing bottleneck: extracts endmember signatures from low-resolution HSI, uses a compact MLP to predict abundance-like maps from MSI, reconstructs spectra by linear mixing, and trains self-supervised via MSI sensor's spectral response function.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised/self-supervised baselines and remains competitive with supervised baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets. Trains in under a minute and works with single-band MSI.

Conclusion: SpectraMorph provides an interpretable, fast-training, and robust solution for hyperspectral super-resolution that maintains performance even with limited MSI bands through its physics-guided unmixing approach.

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

*Nimrod Berman,Omkar Joglekar,Eitan Kosman,Dotan Di Castro,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LDDBM is a general-purpose framework for modality translation using latent-variable diffusion models that bridges arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending diffusion models to modality translation remains challenging due to restrictive assumptions in existing approaches like shared dimensionality, Gaussian priors, and modality-specific architectures.

Method: Uses latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models in shared latent space with contrastive alignment loss, domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture, predictive loss, and improved training strategies.

Result: Performs strongly on diverse MT tasks including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.

Conclusion: Establishes a new strong baseline in general modality translation with comprehensive experimental validation.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer is an interactive framework for multi-subject personalized text-to-image generation that uses a layered canvas representation and locking mechanism to achieve superior spatial control and identity preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized generative models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to multiple subjects, limiting their practical usability.

Method: Introduces a layered canvas where each subject is placed on a distinct layer for occlusion-free composition, and a locking mechanism that preserves selected layers with high fidelity while allowing others to adapt to context. Uses positional embeddings and complementary data sampling without architectural changes.

Result: Extensive experiments show LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity preservation compared to state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject personalized image generation.

Conclusion: LayerComposer provides an interactive framework that enables intuitive layer manipulation similar to professional image-editing software, overcoming limitations of existing personalized generative models.

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

TL;DR: HoloCine bridges the narrative gap in text-to-video generation by creating coherent multi-shot scenes with global consistency, using novel attention mechanisms for precise control and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video models generate isolated clips but fail at creating coherent multi-shot narratives essential for storytelling, creating a 'narrative gap'.

Method: Uses Window Cross-Attention for precise directorial control by localizing text prompts to specific shots, and Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention (dense within shots, sparse between shots) for efficient minute-scale generation.

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence and develops emergent abilities including persistent memory for characters/scenes and intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques.

Conclusion: Marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis to automated filmmaking, making end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making

Motivation: Current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for task-oriented communication, which is essential for effective teamwork in complex tasks requiring diverse communication strategies.

Method: C2C introduces two key innovations: (1) Alignment Factor (AF) - a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that impacts work efficiency, and (2) Sequential Action Framework that integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions, enabling cost-aware communication choices.

Result: Evaluation on realistic coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes (5-17 agents) showed C2C reduces task completion time by about 40% with acceptable communication costs, successfully completes all tasks in standard configurations, and maintains effectiveness at scale.

Conclusion: C2C establishes both a theoretical foundation for measuring communication effectiveness in multi-agent systems and a practical framework for complex collaborative tasks.

Abstract: Teamwork in workspace for complex tasks requires diverse communication
strategies, but current multi-agent LLM systems lack systematic frameworks for
task oriented communication. We introduce Communication to Completion (C2C), a
scalable framework that addresses this gap through two key innovations: (1) the
Alignment Factor (AF), a novel metric quantifying agent task alignment that
directly impacts work efficiency, and (2) a Sequential Action Framework that
integrates stepwise execution with intelligent communication decisions. C2C
enables agents to make cost aware communication choices, dynamically improving
task understanding through targeted interactions. We evaluated C2C on realistic
coding workflows across three complexity tiers and team sizes from 5 to 17

results show that C2C reduces the task completion time by about 40% with
acceptable communication costs. The framework completes all tasks successfully
in standard configurations and maintains effectiveness at scale. C2C

TL;DR: Prompt Decorators introduce a declarative, composable syntax using compact control tokens to govern LLM behavior across reasoning, tone, and structure dimensions without changing task content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users lack consistent control over how LLMs reason and express outputs, and conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose natural-language instructions that limit reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability.

Method: A framework with twenty core decorators organized into Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic families, featuring a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic processing pipeline for predictable behavior composition.

Result: Improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and standardized model behavior across domains, while decoupling task intent from execution behavior.

Conclusion: Prompt Decorators create a reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design with implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to reasoning, writing, and
decision-support workflows, yet users lack consistent control over how they
reason and express outputs. Conventional prompt engineering relies on verbose
natural-language instructions, limiting reproducibility, modularity, and
interpretability. This paper introduces Prompt Decorators, a declarative,
composable syntax that governs LLM behavior through compact control tokens such
as +++Reasoning, +++Tone(style=formal), and +++Import(topic="Systems
Thinking"). Each decorator modifies a behavioral dimension, such as reasoning
style, structure, or tone, without changing task content. The framework
formalizes twenty core decorators organized into two functional families
(Cognitive & Generative and Expressive & Systemic), each further decomposed
into subcategories that govern reasoning, interaction, expression, and
session-control. It defines a unified syntax, scoping model, and deterministic
processing pipeline enabling predictable and auditable behavior composition. By
decoupling task intent from execution behavior, Prompt Decorators create a
reusable and interpretable interface for prompt design. Illustrative use cases
demonstrate improved reasoning transparency, reduced prompt complexity, and
standardized model behavior across domains. The paper concludes with
implications for interoperability, behavioral consistency, and the development
of declarative interfaces for scalable AI systems.

TL;DR: AI-based pose estimation pipeline developed to quantify movement kinematics in resistance training, comparing lengthened partial (pROM) vs full range-of-motion (fROM) training across upper-body exercises.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable precise quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training using AI methods, specifically comparing different training modalities.

Method: Used video data from 26 participants across 8 upper-body exercises (280 recordings), processed with AI pose estimation to extract joint-angle trajectories, filtered and smoothed data, derived metrics including ROM, tempo, and phase durations, applied random-effects meta-analytic model.

Result: pROM repetitions had smaller ROM and shorter durations, especially during eccentric phase. Participant-level differences were primary driver of variation. New %ROM metric shows consistent definition of lengthened partials across exercises.

Conclusion: Lengthened partials differ from full ROM training in ROM, execution dynamics and consistency, demonstrating AI-based methods' potential for advancing resistance training research and prescription.

Abstract: This study develops an AI-based pose estimation pipeline to enable precise
quantification of movement kinematics in resistance training. Using video data
from Wolf et al. (2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full
range-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26
participants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle
trajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,
including range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase
durations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for
within-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM
repetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,
particularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed
that participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were
the primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of
heterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \%ROM, which
is the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this
definition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across
exercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from
full ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and
consistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing
research and improving resistance training prescription.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GUSL-Dehaze is a lightweight image dehazing method that combines physics-based modeling with green learning, avoiding deep learning while achieving comparable performance with fewer parameters and better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning-based dehazing methods have high computational costs and large parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. There's a need for lightweight, transparent alternatives.

Method: Integrates physics-based model with green learning framework. Uses modified Dark Channel Prior for initial dehazing, followed by U-shaped architecture with unsupervised representation learning, feature engineering (RFT and LNT), and transparent supervised learning.

Result: Significantly reduces parameter count while maintaining performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning models, with mathematical interpretability.

Conclusion: GUSL-Dehaze provides an effective lightweight alternative to deep learning approaches for image dehazing, offering transparency and efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from
a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the
physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.
While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning
architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large
parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In
this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image
dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning
(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional
deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze
completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing
step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green
learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This
architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature
extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant
Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a
compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent
supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count
while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par
with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

*Amila Indika,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spreadsheet Operations Documentation (SOD) as an AI task to generate human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations, addressing the lack of systematic documentation methods in spreadsheets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spreadsheets are widely used in business, accounting, and finance, but the absence of systematic documentation hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, risking loss of institutional knowledge.

Method: The authors created a benchmark of 111 spreadsheet manipulation code snippets with natural language summaries, and evaluated five LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B) using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR metrics.

Result: The findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in spreadsheets.

Conclusion: While LLMs show promise for spreadsheet documentation generation, there are still challenges that need to be addressed for practical implementation.

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

challenges such as cross-modal alignment, latency-accuracy tradeoffs, and
semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions
for building more robust and context-aware QA systems leveraging multimedia
data.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The Tredence_AICOE team developed a multilingual e-commerce search system using data augmentation and fine-tuned Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B models for query-category and query-item relevance tasks, achieving 4th place with 0.8857 F1-score.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multilingual e-commerce search challenges by developing systems that can accurately match user queries with product categories and individual items across multiple languages.

Method: Used data augmentation through translation to cover all target languages, fine-tuned Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B models with multiple strategies including 4-bit quantization, and employed minority class data creation for query-item relevance.

Result: Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) achieved best performance for both tasks - QC using original+translated data, QI using original+translated+minority class data. Secured 4th place with average F1-score of 0.8857 on private test set.

Conclusion: The multilingual e-commerce search system successfully addressed both query-category and query-item relevance tasks through strategic data augmentation and model fine-tuning, demonstrating competitive performance in the competition.

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by
the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance
tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original
and translated data, and the best QI performance using original, translated,
and minority class data creation. These approaches secured 4th place on the
final leaderboard, with an average F1-score of 0.8857 on the private test set.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

### [157] [Kinaema: a recurrent sequence model for memory and pose in motion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20261)
*Mert Bulent Sariyildiz,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Guillaume Bono,Gianluca Monaci,Christian Wolf*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Kinaema is a recurrent transformer model for robotics that maintains implicit latent memory of visual observations, enabling efficient spatial awareness and navigation to previously seen goals without explicit observation history storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robots to efficiently situate themselves in previously seen spaces by leveraging information observed before episode start, overcoming limitations of explicit observation history storage and context length constraints.

Method: Uses a transformer with recurrent latent memory that compresses sensor reading history into compact representations, processing visual observations while moving and predicting relative positions without storing explicit observation history.

Result: The model maintains useful scene representations, successfully navigates to goals observed before episode start, and is computationally efficient compared to classical transformers with attention over observation history.

Conclusion: Kinaema's implicit latent memory approach enables efficient spatial awareness and navigation in continuous robotics operations, demonstrating advantages over traditional methods with explicit observation storage.

Abstract: One key aspect of spatially aware robots is the ability to "find their
bearings", ie. to correctly situate themselves in previously seen spaces. In
this work, we focus on this particular scenario of continuous robotics
operations, where information observed before an actual episode start is
exploited to optimize efficiency. We introduce a new model, Kinaema, and agent,
capable of integrating a stream of visual observations while moving in a
potentially large scene, and upon request, processing a query image and
predicting the relative position of the shown space with respect to its current
position. Our model does not explicitly store an observation history, therefore
does not have hard constraints on context length. It maintains an implicit
latent memory, which is updated by a transformer in a recurrent way,
compressing the history of sensor readings into a compact representation. We
evaluate the impact of this model in a new downstream task we call "Mem-Nav".
We show that our large-capacity recurrent model maintains a useful
representation of the scene, navigates to goals observed before the actual
episode start, and is computationally efficient, in particular compared to
classical transformers with attention over an observation history.

*Zixuan Wu,Hengyuan Zhang,Ting-Hsuan Chen,Yuliang Guo,David Paz,Xinyu Huang,Liu Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DDP integrates visual foundation models with diffusion planning for robust autonomous parking under domain shifts, achieving >90% success rate in OOD scenarios with promising sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous parking approaches struggle with robustness under domain shifts like weather and lighting changes, requiring a domain-agnostic solution that doesn't rely on additional data.

Method: Proposes Dino-Diffusion Parking (DDP) pipeline combining visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning, trained in CARLA simulator and transferred zero-shot to adversarial settings.

Result: Consistently achieves >90% parking success rate across all tested out-of-distribution scenarios, with ablation studies confirming both architecture and algorithmic design enhance cross-domain performance over baselines.

Conclusion: DDP demonstrates strong domain-agnostic performance and promising sim-to-real transfer capability in real-world parking lot reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting.

Abstract: Parking is a critical pillar of driving safety. While recent end-to-end (E2E)
approaches have achieved promising in-domain results, robustness under domain
shifts (e.g., weather and lighting changes) remains a key challenge. Rather
than relying on additional data, in this paper, we propose Dino-Diffusion
Parking (DDP), a domain-agnostic autonomous parking pipeline that integrates
visual foundation models with diffusion-based planning to enable generalized
perception and robust motion planning under distribution shifts. We train our
pipeline in CARLA at regular setting and transfer it to more adversarial
settings in a zero-shot fashion. Our model consistently achieves a parking
success rate above 90% across all tested out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios,
with ablation studies confirming that both the network architecture and
algorithmic design significantly enhance cross-domain performance over existing
baselines. Furthermore, testing in a 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) environment
reconstructed from a real-world parking lot demonstrates promising sim-to-real
transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GSWorld is a photo-realistic robotics simulator using 3D Gaussian Splatting and physics engines to enable sim2real policy training without real robots, featuring a new GSDF asset format and demonstrating multiple manipulation applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a robust simulator that enables reproducible evaluation of manipulation policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real policy training without requiring actual robots, closing the development loop.

Method: Combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines using a new GSDF (Gaussian Scene Description File) asset format that integrates Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with robot URDF and objects. Includes a streamlined reconstruction pipeline and curated database with 3 robot embodiments and 40+ objects.

Result: Developed a functional simulator demonstrating five key applications: zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action policies, automated DAgger data collection, reproducible policy benchmarking, virtual teleoperation data collection, and zero-shot sim2real visual reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: GSWorld successfully bridges simulation and reality for robotics manipulation, enabling various training and evaluation scenarios without physical robots while maintaining photo-realism through Gaussian Splatting technology.

Abstract: This paper presents GSWorld, a robust, photo-realistic simulator for robotics
manipulation that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting with physics engines. Our
framework advocates "closing the loop" of developing manipulation policies with
reproducible evaluation of policies learned from real-robot data and sim2real
policy training without using real robots. To enable photo-realistic rendering
of diverse scenes, we propose a new asset format, which we term GSDF (Gaussian
Scene Description File), that infuses Gaussian-on-Mesh representation with
robot URDF and other objects. With a streamlined reconstruction pipeline, we
curate a database of GSDF that contains 3 robot embodiments for single-arm and
bimanual manipulation, as well as more than 40 objects. Combining GSDF with
physics engines, we demonstrate several immediate interesting applications: (1)
learning zero-shot sim2real pixel-to-action manipulation policy with
photo-realistic rendering, (2) automated high-quality DAgger data collection
for adapting policies to deployment environments, (3) reproducible benchmarking
of real-robot manipulation policies in simulation, (4) simulation data
collection by virtual teleoperation, and (5) zero-shot sim2real visual
reinforcement learning. Website: https://3dgsworld.github.io/.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Branch-and-Browse is a fine-grained web agent framework that improves autonomous web agents by combining structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution, achieving 35.8% task success rate on WebArena with 40.4% faster execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing autonomous web agents powered by LLMs have limitations in reasoning depth and efficiency - linear methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack backtracking, while other search strategies are computationally costly.

Method: The framework employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for multi-branch reasoning, bootstraps exploration through web state replay with background reasoning, and uses page action memory to share explored actions across sessions.

Result: On WebArena benchmark, achieved 35.8% task success rate and reduced execution time by up to 40.4% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and efficient framework for LLM-based web agents that demonstrates practical embodied reasoning in open web environments.

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A method using LLMs to hide secret messages within seemingly normal text of the same length, enabling covert communication that decouples text from authorial intent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate how LLMs can be used to embed secret messages within plausible-looking text, potentially eroding trust in written communication and enabling covert deployment of unfiltered AI systems.

Method: A simple and efficient protocol using modest 8-billion-parameter open-source LLMs to encode and decode messages within text of identical length, working locally on laptops in seconds.

Result: High-quality results achieved where meaningful text can be hidden inside completely different yet coherent text, with messages as long as abstracts being encoded/decoded quickly on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: This protocol demonstrates radical decoupling of text from intent, raises urgent AI safety concerns, and challenges our understanding of what LLMs truly know, as companies could covertly deploy unfiltered models through this technique.

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

Motivation: To create a trustworthy AI system for high-stakes finance that goes beyond reactive chatbots by proactively generating user-specific investment insights while ensuring compliance with financial regulations.

Method: Uses component-based orchestration for deterministic routing between LLMs based on data sensitivity, hybrid retrieval with OpenSearch and finance-domain embeddings, and multi-stage recommendation combining rule heuristics, behavioral modeling, and contextual bandits.

Result: Successfully deployed on-premises under Korean financial regulations using Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, demonstrating trustworthy AI insights through human QA and system metrics.

Conclusion: Grounded generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI insights in high-stakes finance environments.

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

TL;DR: IKnow is a framework for continual pretraining of LLMs that uses instruction-response dialogue format to preserve instruction-following capabilities while adapting to new domains, without needing base model weights or external databases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-supervised objectives degrade instruction-following capabilities in instruction-tuned models during continual pretraining. Existing solutions require access to base model weights or external databases, which are often unavailable in practice.

Method: Proposes IKnow framework with novel self-supervised objectives in instruction-response dialogue format. Leverages domain knowledge embedded within text itself and learns to encode it at deeper semantic level.

Result: Not specified in abstract

Conclusion: IKnow provides a simple and general framework for continual adaptation that doesn't depend on external resources, addressing practical barriers in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CaSE (causal stepwise evaluation) provides a granular method to assess reasoning quality by measuring relevance and coherence of each step, enabling better model improvement than final-answer correctness alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation focuses only on final-answer correctness, which provides coarse improvement signals and ignores reasoning process quality. A more granular evaluation of reasoning is needed to build robust models.

Method: Decompose reasoning quality into relevance (grounded in problem) and coherence (logical flow from prior steps). Introduce CaSE method that assesses each reasoning step using only preceding context to avoid hindsight bias. Validate against human judgments on expert-annotated benchmarks MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH.

Result: CaSE reliably measures reasoning quality dimensions. Curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence directly improves final task performance. Provides scalable framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: Moving beyond simple validity checks to granular reasoning evaluation offers practical value for building better LLMs, with CaSE providing an effective framework for this purpose.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: DeEAR is a framework that converts human preference for speech expressiveness into an objective score, addressing the lack of reliable evaluation metrics for speech-to-speech models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing speech-to-speech models generate intelligible speech but lack natural expressiveness due to the absence of reliable evaluation metrics. Current approaches like subjective MOS ratings, acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or incomplete.

Method: DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions (Emotion, Prosody, and Spontaneity) based on phonetics and psychology principles. It converts human preference into objective scores using fewer than 500 annotated samples.

Result: DeEAR achieves strong alignment with human perception (SRCC = 0.86). It enables fair benchmarking, distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models, and curates ExpressiveSpeech dataset of 14K utterances that improves expressive scores from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale.

Conclusion: DeEAR provides a reliable framework for evaluating speech expressiveness, enabling better benchmarking and targeted data curation to improve the expressiveness of speech-to-speech models.

Abstract: Recent speech-to-speech (S2S) models generate intelligible speech but still
lack natural expressiveness, largely due to the absence of a reliable
evaluation metric. Existing approaches, such as subjective MOS ratings,
low-level acoustic features, and emotion recognition are costly, limited, or
incomplete. To address this, we present DeEAR (Decoding the Expressive
Preference of eAR), a framework that converts human preference for speech
expressiveness into an objective score. Grounded in phonetics and psychology,
DeEAR evaluates speech across three dimensions: Emotion, Prosody, and
Spontaneity, achieving strong alignment with human perception (Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient, SRCC = 0.86) using fewer than 500 annotated samples.
Beyond reliable scoring, DeEAR enables fair benchmarking and targeted data
curation. It not only distinguishes expressiveness gaps across S2S models but
also selects 14K expressive utterances to form ExpressiveSpeech, which improves
the expressive score (from 2.0 to 23.4 on a 100-point scale) of S2S models.

TL;DR: RLEV extends RLVR by incorporating human-defined value signals into reward functions, enabling LLMs to optimize for both correctness and importance of tasks, resulting in value-sensitive termination policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods like RLVR focus only on binary correctness rewards but overlook that not all tasks are equally important or valuable to humans.

Method: RLEV incorporates explicit human value signals directly into the reward function using exam-style data with ground-truth value labels, enabling value-weighted gradient amplification.

Result: RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL algorithms and model scales, achieving improved value-weighted accuracy and learning value-sensitive termination policies.

Conclusion: Optimizing for explicit utility functions offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities, remaining robust even under noisy value signals like difficulty-based labels.

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

### [168] [ImpossibleBench: Measuring LLMs' Propensity of Exploiting Test Cases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20270)
*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench is a benchmark framework that measures LLM agents' propensity to exploit test cases by creating "impossible" tasks with conflicts between specifications and unit tests, quantifying cheating behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs tend to find shortcuts that undermine benchmark validity and real-world reliability, such as deleting failing tests instead of fixing bugs.

Method: Creates impossible variants of existing benchmarks by introducing conflicts between natural-language specifications and unit tests, measuring cheating rate as pass rate on these tasks.

Result: Reveals fine-grained cheating behaviors from simple test modification to complex operator overloading, and shows how prompt, test access and feedback affect cheating rates.

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench serves as a versatile tool for studying model behaviors, context engineering, and developing monitoring tools to build more robust LLM systems.

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

### [169] [Relative-Based Scaling Law for Neural Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20387)
*Baoqing Yue,Jinyuan Zhou,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric and establishes Relative-Based Scaling Law to complement cross-entropy scaling laws by focusing on relative token ordering rather than absolute probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws rely solely on cross-entropy, which only measures absolute probability of correct tokens and ignores relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens. This limitation is crucial for language models, especially in greedy-sampling scenarios where relative ranking matters.

Method: Proposed Relative-Based Probability (RBP) metric that quantifies the probability that the correct token is ranked among the top predictions. Established Relative-Based Scaling Law to characterize how RBP improves with increasing model size through extensive experiments on four datasets and four model families spanning five orders of magnitude.

Result: Demonstrated robustness and accuracy of the Relative-Based Scaling Law across extensive experiments. Showed applications in providing deeper explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental theories of scaling laws.

Conclusion: The Relative-Based Scaling Law complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete understanding of scaling large language models, offering valuable insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

### [170] [FINDER: Feature Inference on Noisy Datasets using Eigenspace Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19917)
*Trajan Murphy,Akshunna S. Dogra,Hanfeng Gu,Caleb Meredith,Mark Kon,Julio Enrique Castrillion-Candas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINDER is a classification framework for noisy datasets that uses stochastic analysis and Hilbert space mapping to create stochastic features, which are decomposed via KLE for robust classification in data-deficient domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy datasets with low signal-to-noise ratios, small sample sizes, and faulty data collection remain challenging for classification methods, requiring specialized approaches that account for inherent randomness.

Method: FINDER treats datasets as realizations from random fields, maps them to Hilbert spaces to create stochastic features, uses Kosambi-Karhunen-Loève expansion for decomposition into irreducible components, and performs classification via eigen-decomposition of associated operators.

Result: FINDER achieved state-of-the-art performance in challenging domains: Alzheimer's Disease stage classification and remote sensing detection of deforestation, demonstrating effectiveness in data-deficient scientific applications.

Conclusion: The framework provides a rigorous approach for noisy dataset classification, with discussion on when it outperforms existing methods, its failure modes, and limitations.

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

### [171] [Why Prototypes Collapse: Diagnosing and Preventing Partial Collapse in Prototypical Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20108)
*Gabriel Y. Arteaga,Marius Aasan,Rwiddhi Chakraborty,Martine Hjelkrem-Tan,Thalles Silva,Michael Kampffmeyer,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper addresses prototype collapse in self-supervised learning by proposing a decoupled training strategy that separates prototype learning from encoder optimization using an online EM-style procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-supervised learning methods suffer from partial prototype collapse where multiple prototypes converge to similar representations, undermining their purpose of providing diverse targets. Current solutions over-parameterize or add regularizers rather than addressing the root cause.

Method: Introduces fully decoupled training that learns prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Prototypes are modeled as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure independent of the encoder's loss.

Result: The decoupling eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization, yielding consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Conclusion: Breaking the joint optimization between encoders and prototypes through principled decoupling effectively addresses the root cause of prototype collapse and improves representation learning.

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph is a backdoor attack method targeting latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, using textual triggers to poison training data and implant backdoors that generate attacker-specified subgraphs during inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the security concerns in graph generation, particularly backdoor vulnerabilities in conditional text-guided graph generation which remains largely unexamined compared to image diffusion and unconditional graph generation.

Method: Leverages textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors in latent diffusion models that induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear, while maintaining normal performance on clean inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show high effectiveness and stealth: less than 10% poisoning rate achieves 50% attack success rate, 24% suffices for over 80% success rate, with negligible performance degradation on benign samples.

Conclusion: The findings reveal security vulnerabilities in latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation, highlight serious risks in applications like drug discovery, and underscore the need for robust defenses against backdoor attacks in such diffusion models.

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

### [173] [Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient Step on 100 Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20800)
*Shiva Sreeram,Alaa Maalouf,Pratyusha Sharma,Daniela Rus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LASER++ improves upon LASER by eliminating exhaustive layer-by-layer search, using gradient-based matrix selection, clustering for better factorization, and reducing data requirements to just 100 samples for fast LLM adaptation without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The original LASER method requires exhaustive per-matrix search with full dataset forward passes, making it impractical for rapid deployment. This work aims to remove this overhead while maintaining or improving performance.

Method: Uses gradient of singular values to identify important matrices, allows clustering for multiple subspace decomposition, and reduces data requirements to 100 samples for both gradient computation and accuracy evaluation.

Result: Achieves up to 24.6 percentage point accuracy improvement, eliminates layer-by-layer sweep overhead, and enables fast adaptation with minimal data requirements.

Conclusion: Combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm that can adapt LLMs to new datasets with a single gradient step on 100 examples and quick layer scanning, entirely without fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

*Estelle Chigot,Dennis G. Wilson,Meriem Ghrib,Fabrice Jimenez,Thomas Oberlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Using synthetic images from flight simulators to train runway detection models for autonomous landing systems, addressing data scarcity in critical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training deep vision models for critical applications like autonomous navigation requires extensive data collection and labeling, which is costly and difficult, especially for rare scenarios. Synthetic image generation offers a cost-effective solution to cover all conditions.

Method: Proposed an image generation approach using a commercial flight simulator to complement few annotated real images. Used controlled image generation and integration of real/synthetic data with customized domain adaptation.

Result: Standard object detection models achieved accurate prediction. Demonstrated robustness to adverse conditions (nighttime images) not present in real data through customized domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Synthetic image generation from flight simulators combined with domain adaptation is an effective approach for training robust runway detection models in autonomous landing systems, overcoming data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

### [175] [Transferable Black-Box One-Shot Forging of Watermarks via Image Preference Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20468)
*Tomáš Souček,Sylvestre-Alvise Rebuffi,Pierre Fernandez,Nikola Jovanović,Hady Elsahar,Valeriu Lacatusu,Tuan Tran,Alexandre Mourachko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates watermark forging attacks on post-hoc image watermarking systems, introducing a method to remove and forge watermarks without knowledge of the watermarking model using only a single watermarked image.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of AI-generated content and legal requirements for content attribution, watermarking has become crucial. However, watermark forging (stealing watermarks from genuine content and applying them to malicious content) remains underexplored compared to removal attacks.

Method: The authors introduce a preference model trained with ranking loss on procedurally generated images to detect watermarks, then use this model to optimize input images through backpropagation for both watermark removal and forging.

Result: The proposed method effectively forges watermarks across various post-hoc image watermarking models, requiring only a single watermarked image and no knowledge of the watermarking model, making it simpler and more practical than existing attacks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully questions the security of current watermarking methods by demonstrating effective watermark forging capabilities, highlighting vulnerabilities in existing watermarking systems.

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEIcoder is a biologically informed decoding method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in V1, especially effective with small datasets and few neurons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological neural data is often scarce in primates/humans due to recording challenges, posing difficulties for deep learning decoding techniques.

Method: Leverages neuron-specific most exciting inputs (MEIs), structural similarity index measure loss, and adversarial training to decode visual stimuli from neural activity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, reconstructs high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500 neurons and less than 1,000 training data points.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and provides practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500
neurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified
benchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of reliable decoding in early visual system and
provide practical insights for neuroscience and neuroengineering applications.

*Yuyang Jiang,Longjie Guo,Yuchen Wu,Aylin Caliskan,Tanu Mitra,Hua Shen*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This study examines bi-directional influence in human-LLM conversations on controversial topics, finding that LLMs change more than humans do, with personalization amplifying these shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how user input affects LLM responses and how bi-directional influence manifests in multi-turn conversations, extending beyond prior research on one-way influence.

Method: Conducted 50 controversial-topic discussions with 266 participants across three conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.

Result: Human opinions barely shifted while LLM outputs changed substantially, narrowing the stance gap. Personalization amplified shifts in both directions. Personal stories triggered the most stance changes for both humans and LLMs.

Conclusion: Highlights the risk of over-alignment in human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots to achieve more thoughtful and stable alignment with users.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots are increasingly used for opinion
exploration. Prior research examined how LLMs alter user views, yet little work
extended beyond one-way influence to address how user input can affect LLM
responses and how such bi-directional influence manifests throughout the
multi-turn conversations. This study investigates this dynamic through 50
controversial-topic discussions with participants (N=266) across three
conditions: static statements, standard chatbot, and personalized chatbot.
Results show that human opinions barely shifted, while LLM outputs changed more
substantially, narrowing the gap between human and LLM stance. Personalization
amplified these shifts in both directions compared to the standard setting.
Analysis of multi-turn conversations further revealed that exchanges involving
participants' personal stories were most likely to trigger stance changes for
both humans and LLMs. Our work highlights the risk of over-alignment in
human-LLM interaction and the need for careful design of personalized chatbots
to more thoughtfully and stably align with users.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Empathic Prompting is a framework that integrates facial expression recognition to add emotional context to LLM conversations, improving conversational fluidity without explicit user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal interfaces lack the ability to capture implicit emotional cues that are critical in domains like healthcare and education, where users' emotional states are important but often not explicitly stated.

Method: The system uses a commercial facial expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues, embeds them as contextual signals during prompting, and integrates with a locally deployed DeepSeek LLM instance through a modular architecture.

Result: Preliminary evaluation (N=5) showed consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with participants highlighting improved conversational fluidity.

Conclusion: Empathic prompting enables more natural human-AI interaction by incorporating emotional context, with potential applications in healthcare and education where emotional signals are critical.

Abstract: We present Empathic Prompting, a novel framework for multimodal human-AI
interaction that enriches Large Language Model (LLM) conversations with
implicit non-verbal context. The system integrates a commercial facial
expression recognition service to capture users' emotional cues and embeds them
as contextual signals during prompting. Unlike traditional multimodal
interfaces, empathic prompting requires no explicit user control; instead, it
unobtrusively augments textual input with affective information for
conversational and smoothness alignment. The architecture is modular and
scalable, allowing integration of additional non-verbal modules. We describe
the system design, implemented through a locally deployed DeepSeek instance,
and report a preliminary service and usability evaluation (N=5). Results show
consistent integration of non-verbal input into coherent LLM outputs, with
participants highlighting conversational fluidity. Beyond this proof of
concept, empathic prompting points to applications in chatbot-mediated
communication, particularly in domains like healthcare or education, where
users' emotional signals are critical yet often opaque in verbal exchanges.

*Xi He,Sirui Lu,Bei Zeng*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A multi-agent workflow using GPT-5 and SSLP framework co-designs quantum codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates through systematic enumeration and analytical reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a scalable approach for designing quantum codes with specific transversal diagonal gates by combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical methods.

Method: Multi-agent human-in-the-loop workflow using SSLP framework, with three specialized agents (Synthesis, Search, Audit) collaborating in a LaTeX-Python environment with Git/Overleaf synchronization.

Result: Successfully generated new quantum codes for distance d=2 with nondegenerate residues, including a ((6,4,2)) code implementing controlled-phase gate, and cataloged attainable cyclic logical groups for K∈{2,3,4} and n≤6 qubits.

Conclusion: The workflow transforms diagonal-transversal feasibility into an analytical pipeline that combines systematic enumeration with exact reconstruction, enabling reproducible code constructions and supporting extensions to larger code dimensions and higher distances.

Abstract: We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum
codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum
Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis
strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)
equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented
within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that
supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow
reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,
edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.
Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates
the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics
into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and
the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with
nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits,
systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic
logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$
at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring
structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities
for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue
degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal
controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts
diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,
combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It
yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger
$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.
