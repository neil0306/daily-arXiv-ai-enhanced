Recently,\nfinetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred\nchoice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former\nachieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to\ncommon biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical\nconcerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this\npaper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of\nthese judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges\nfinetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by\nfuture models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well\njudges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three\naspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and\ntest distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three\ndifferent base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging\nfor most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with\nDPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that\ncontinual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older\nand newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker\nresponses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance\ndegradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones,\nshowing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions.

Second, a quality-driven contrastive\nlearning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to\ndynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality\npairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and\nvision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2\nby +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it\nraises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and\n+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text\nretrieval R@5 by +3.2%.

The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is\namplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),\nand can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its\ncore design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --\nto lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\\ell_2$ norm), leveraging\nhyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical\nconstraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance\ncollapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet\ngeneration, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,\nachieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54\nand SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger\nbaselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92).

Recently,\nnumerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they\nare often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and\nrarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we\nintroduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning\nbenchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the\nwidely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed\nautomated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,\nwe curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source\nand closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs\nhave nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains\nsubstantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing\nmodel, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on\nGSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the\nlimitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.\nGSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and\nestablishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and\ngeneralizable VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "GSM8K-V is a new visual mathematical reasoning benchmark created by converting text-based GSM8K problems into visual format, revealing significant performance gaps between text and visual reasoning in current vision language models.", "motivation": "Existing visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks are limited to geometry, lack math word problems, and rarely assess multi-image reasoning.
