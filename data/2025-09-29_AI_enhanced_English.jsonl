Reinforcement learning (RL)\noffers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,\nyet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and\nlacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating\npolicy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better\nunderstand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link\nbetween policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals\nthat structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.\nMotivated by this insight, we propose \\textbf{Res}haped \\textbf{T}oken-level\npolicy gradients (\\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy\ngradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting\nreasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a\nsmooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes\nconvergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows\nthat ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up\nto $8.76\\%$.
