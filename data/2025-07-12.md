### [1] [Planted in Pretraining, Swayed by Finetuning: A Case Study on the Origins of Cognitive Biases in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07186)
*Itay Itzhak,Yonatan Belinkov,Gabriel Stanovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates cognitive biases in LLMs, proposing a method to determine if biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or random noise. Findings show biases are mainly shaped by pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the origins of cognitive biases in LLMs and whether they arise from pretraining, finetuning, or random training noise.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) finetuning models with different random seeds to study randomness effects, and (2) cross-tuning by swapping instruction datasets to isolate bias sources.

Result: Biases are primarily influenced by pretraining, with models sharing the same pretrained backbone showing more similar bias patterns than those sharing finetuning data.

Conclusion: Understanding biases in finetuned LLMs requires considering pretraining origins, guiding future strategies for bias evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases -- systematic
tendencies of irrational decision-making, similar to those seen in humans.
Prior work has found that these biases vary across models and can be amplified
by instruction tuning. However, it remains unclear if these differences in
biases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training
stochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to
disentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using
different random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$
cognitive biases. Second, we introduce \emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping
instruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses
datasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases
are dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness
introduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models
with the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those
sharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases
in finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond
finetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop
principled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.

### [2] [Prompt Perturbations Reveal Human-Like Biases in LLM Survey Responses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07188)
*Jens Rupprecht,Georg Ahnert,Markus Strohmaier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines the reliability of LLMs in social science surveys, revealing vulnerabilities to perturbations and a recency bias, emphasizing the need for robust prompt design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the reliability and susceptibility of LLMs to response biases in normative survey contexts, as they are increasingly used as human proxies.

Method: Tested nine diverse LLMs on WVS questions, applying 11 perturbations to question phrasing and answer options, resulting in 167,000 simulated interviews.

Result: LLMs exhibit recency bias and sensitivity to semantic variations; larger models are more robust but still affected by combined perturbations.

Conclusion: Prompt design and robustness testing are crucial when using LLMs for synthetic survey data due to their alignment with human response biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human
subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to
known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the
response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts -- we test nine
diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a
comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer
option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so,
we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also reveal that
all tested models exhibit a consistent \textit{recency bias} varying in
intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While
larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to
semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By
applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with
survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical
importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate
synthetic survey data.

### [3] [SynthTextEval: Synthetic Text Data Generation and Evaluation for High-Stakes Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07229)
*Krithika Ramesh,Daniel Smolyak,Zihao Zhao,Nupoor Gandhi,Ritu Agarwal,Margrét Bjarnadóttir,Anjalie Field*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthTextEval is a toolkit for evaluating synthetic text across multiple dimensions, aiming to enhance privacy-preserving AI development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for consistent, principled evaluations of synthetic text to ensure its utility, fairness, privacy, and alignment with source data in high-stakes domains like healthcare and law.

Method: The toolkit provides modules for generating synthetic text and evaluating it across dimensions like utility, fairness, privacy leakage, distributional differences, and expert feedback.

Result: Demonstrated functionality and effectiveness in high-stakes domains, consolidating and standardizing evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: SynthTextEval improves the viability of synthetic text for privacy-preserving AI development by offering comprehensive evaluation tools.

Abstract: We present SynthTextEval, a toolkit for conducting comprehensive evaluations
of synthetic text. The fluency of large language model (LLM) outputs has made
synthetic text potentially viable for numerous applications, such as reducing
the risks of privacy violations in the development and deployment of AI systems
in high-stakes domains. Realizing this potential, however, requires principled
consistent evaluations of synthetic data across multiple dimensions: its
utility in downstream systems, the fairness of these systems, the risk of
privacy leakage, general distributional differences from the source text, and
qualitative feedback from domain experts. SynthTextEval allows users to conduct
evaluations along all of these dimensions over synthetic data that they upload
or generate using the toolkit's generation module. While our toolkit can be run
over any data, we highlight its functionality and effectiveness over datasets
from two high-stakes domains: healthcare and law. By consolidating and
standardizing evaluation metrics, we aim to improve the viability of synthetic
text, and in-turn, privacy-preservation in AI development.

### [4] [Medical Red Teaming Protocol of Language Models: On the Importance of User Perspectives in Healthcare Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07248)
*Minseon Kim,Jean-Philippe Corbeil,Alessandro Sordoni,Francois Beaulieu,Paul Vozila*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a safety evaluation protocol for medical LLMs, addressing gaps in prior evaluations by focusing on patient and clinician perspectives, and presents PatientSafetyBench for quantitative analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The adoption of LLMs in medicine raises safety concerns due to diverse user roles and health impacts, yet prior evaluations lacked domain-specific focus.

Method: A tailored safety evaluation protocol is developed, including PatientSafetyBench with 466 samples across 5 categories, and applied via red-teaming on MediPhi models.

Result: The work establishes the first safety criteria for medical LLMs from patient, clinician, and general user perspectives, enabling safer deployment.

Conclusion: This study bridges a critical gap in medical LLM safety evaluation, providing a foundation for future research and safer real-world applications.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance,
their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the
medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises
critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse
roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to
directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of
medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general
safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol
tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user
perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze
the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the
PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure
safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols
on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the
first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through
targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient,
clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in
medical domains.

### [5] [The Impact of Background Speech on Interruption Detection in Collaborative Groups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07280)
*Mariah Bradford,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,Nathaniel Blanchard*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores interruption detection in collaborative learning, addressing challenges like overlapping speech in multi-group settings, and proposes a robust AI-driven method for classrooms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI-driven support for teachers by accurately detecting interruptions in noisy, multi-group classroom environments.

Method: Analyzes interruption detection in single and multi-group dialogues, then develops a state-of-the-art method robust to overlapping speech.

Result: A robust interruption identification method and insights into linguistic/prosodic features of interruptions in group interactions.

Conclusion: The work advances interruption detection for classrooms and sets a foundation for future research on overlapping speech in group dialogue.

Abstract: Interruption plays a crucial role in collaborative learning, shaping group
interactions and influencing knowledge construction. AI-driven support can
assist teachers in monitoring these interactions. However, most previous work
on interruption detection and interpretation has been conducted in
single-conversation environments with relatively clean audio. AI agents
deployed in classrooms for collaborative learning within small groups will need
to contend with multiple concurrent conversations -- in this context,
overlapping speech will be ubiquitous, and interruptions will need to be
identified in other ways. In this work, we analyze interruption detection in
single-conversation and multi-group dialogue settings. We then create a
state-of-the-art method for interruption identification that is robust to
overlapping speech, and thus could be deployed in classrooms. Further, our work
highlights meaningful linguistic and prosodic information about how
interruptions manifest in collaborative group interactions. Our investigation
also paves the way for future works to account for the influence of overlapping
speech from multiple groups when tracking group dialog.

### [6] [Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Evidence-Based Counterspeech Against Health Misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07307)
*Anirban Saha Anik,Xiaoying Song,Elliott Wang,Bryan Wang,Bengisu Yarimbas,Lingzi Hong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework improves counterspeech generation against health misinformation by optimizing knowledge retrieval and response refinement, outperforming baselines in quality and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for generating counterspeech against misinformation rely on limited evidence and lack control over outputs, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: The proposed framework uses multiple LLMs to integrate static and dynamic evidence, enhancing knowledge retrieval, evidence, and response refinement for better counterspeech.

Result: The method outperforms baselines in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and factual accuracy, with human evaluations confirming quality improvements.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates high-quality counterspeech, validated by ablation studies and human preference, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in generating counterspeech
against misinformation. However, current studies rely on limited evidence and
offer less control over final outputs. To address these challenges, we propose
a Multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Framework to generate counterspeech against
health misinformation, incorporating multiple LLMs to optimize knowledge
retrieval, evidence enhancement, and response refinement. Our approach
integrates both static and dynamic evidence, ensuring that the generated
counterspeech is relevant, well-grounded, and up-to-date. Our method
outperforms baseline approaches in politeness, relevance, informativeness, and
factual accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-quality
counterspeech. To further validate our approach, we conduct ablation studies to
verify the necessity of each component in our framework. Furthermore, human
evaluations reveal that refinement significantly enhances counterspeech quality
and obtains human preference.

### [7] [GNN-CNN: An Efficient Hybrid Model of Convolutional and Graph Neural Networks for Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07414)
*Fardin Rastakhiz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel DL model combining GNNs and CNNs with real-time graph generation addresses inefficiencies of Transformers for long texts, achieving competitive performance in text classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' quadratic complexity makes them inefficient for long texts, necessitating a more efficient architecture.

Method: Integrates GNNs and CNNs with real-time graph generation, uses LLM inputs, and employs small-world graphs for document-level aggregation.

Result: Model shows structural semantic organization (clustering coefficient ~0.45, shortest path 4-5) and competitive performance in text classification.

Conclusion: The proposed model is efficient and effective for processing long texts, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Time, cost, and energy efficiency are critical considerations in
Deep-Learning (DL), particularly when processing long texts. Transformers,
which represent the current state of the art, exhibit quadratic computational
complexity relative to input length, making them inefficient for extended
documents. This study introduces a novel model architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), integrated
with a real-time, end-to-end graph generation mechanism. The model processes
compact batches of character-level inputs without requiring padding or
truncation. To enhance performance while maintaining high speed and efficiency,
the model incorporates information from Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
token embeddings and sentiment polarities, through efficient dictionary
lookups. It captures local contextual patterns using CNNs, expands local
receptive fields via lattice-based graph structures, and employs small-world
graphs to aggregate document-level information. The generated graphs exhibit
structural properties indicative of meaningful semantic organization, with an
average clustering coefficient of approximately 0.45 and an average shortest
path length ranging between 4 and 5. The model is evaluated across multiple
text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis and
news-categorization, and is compared against state-of-the-art models.
Experimental results confirm the proposed model's efficiency and competitive
performance.

### [8] [MedReadCtrl: Personalizing medical text generation with readability-controlled instruction learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07419)
*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Won Seok Jang,Sharmin Sultana,Allen Chang,Yuan Zhang,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedReadCtrl is a framework that improves AI-generated healthcare content by adjusting readability while preserving meaning, outperforming GPT-4 in readability and task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effective human-AI communication in healthcare requires personalized and understandable content, which current models struggle with.

Method: MedReadCtrl uses readability-controlled instruction tuning to adjust output complexity without losing meaning.

Result: MedReadCtrl outperforms GPT-4 in readability and task performance, with experts preferring it, especially for low-literacy users.

Conclusion: MedReadCtrl offers a scalable solution for improving patient education and equitable access to AI-enabled healthcare.

Abstract: Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential in healthcare, from clinical
decision support to patient-facing chatbots that improve outcomes. A critical
challenge for deployment is effective human-AI communication, where content
must be both personalized and understandable. We introduce MedReadCtrl, a
readability-controlled instruction tuning framework that enables LLMs to adjust
output complexity without compromising meaning. Evaluations of nine datasets
and three tasks across medical and general domains show that MedReadCtrl
achieves significantly lower readability instruction-following errors than
GPT-4 (e.g., 1.39 vs. 1.59 on ReadMe, p<0.001) and delivers substantial gains
on unseen clinical tasks (e.g., +14.7 ROUGE-L, +6.18 SARI on MTSamples).
Experts consistently preferred MedReadCtrl (71.7% vs. 23.3%), especially at low
literacy levels. These gains reflect MedReadCtrl's ability to restructure
clinical content into accessible, readability-aligned language while preserving
medical intent, offering a scalable solution to support patient education and
expand equitable access to AI-enabled care.

*Zonghai Yao,Youxia Zhao,Avijit Mitra,David A. Levy,Emily Druhl,Jack Tsai,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynthEHR-Eviction is a pipeline using LLMs and human-in-the-loop annotation to extract eviction data from EHRs, creating a large SDoH dataset with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eviction is a critical but understudied SDoH, often missing in structured EHRs, limiting research and applications.

Method: Combines LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes.

Result: Achieved high Macro-F1 scores (88.8% for eviction, 90.3% for other SDoH), outperforming GPT-4o and BioBERT, with 80% reduced annotation effort.

Conclusion: The pipeline is scalable, cost-effective, and generalizable to other information extraction tasks.

Abstract: Eviction is a significant yet understudied social determinants of health
(SDoH), linked to housing instability, unemployment, and mental health. While
eviction appears in unstructured electronic health records (EHRs), it is rarely
coded in structured fields, limiting downstream applications. We introduce
SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop
annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction
statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest
public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained
categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on
SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other
SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%),
GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling
cost-effective deployment across various model sizes. The pipeline reduces
annotation effort by over 80%, accelerates dataset creation, enables scalable
eviction detection, and generalizes to other information extraction tasks.

*Matthieu Boileau,Philippe Helluy,Jeremy Pawlus,Svitlana Vyetrenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores distilling time series reasoning into small language models using synthetic data and natural language annotations, achieving interpretable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build interpretable time series foundation models suitable for lightweight, privacy-sensitive applications.

Method: Uses a synthetic dataset of mean-reverting time series with varied trends and noise levels, generates annotations via a large multimodal model, and fine-tunes compact Qwen models.

Result: Post-trained models show meaningful interpretive capabilities in trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of compressing time series understanding into small, interpretable models for practical deployment.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the distillation of time series reasoning
capabilities into small, instruction-tuned language models as a step toward
building interpretable time series foundation models. Leveraging a synthetic
dataset of mean-reverting time series with systematically varied trends and
noise levels, we generate natural language annotations using a large multimodal
model and use these to supervise the fine-tuning of compact Qwen models. We
introduce evaluation metrics that assess the quality of the distilled reasoning
- focusing on trend direction, noise intensity, and extremum localization - and
show that the post-trained models acquire meaningful interpretive capabilities.
Our results highlight the feasibility of compressing time series understanding
into lightweight, language-capable models suitable for on-device or
privacy-sensitive deployment. This work contributes a concrete foundation
toward developing small, interpretable models that explain temporal patterns in
natural language.

### [11] [SAND: Boosting LLM Agents with Self-Taught Action Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07441)
*Yu Xia,Yiran Jenny Shen,Junda Wu,Tong Yu,Sungchul Kim,Ryan A. Rossi,Lina Yao,Julian McAuley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAND framework improves LLM agents by enabling deliberation over actions, outperforming existing methods by 20%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM agent tuning methods may lead to suboptimal actions due to limited exploration of alternatives.

Method: Proposes SAND, incorporating self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided critique for step-wise deliberation.

Result: Achieves 20% improvement over initial supervised finetuning and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: SAND enhances LLM agent performance by promoting deliberate action selection.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are commonly tuned with supervised
finetuning on ReAct-style expert trajectories or preference optimization over
pairwise rollouts. Most of these methods focus on imitating specific expert
behaviors or promoting chosen reasoning thoughts and actions over rejected
ones. However, without reasoning and comparing over alternatives actions, LLM
agents finetuned with these methods may over-commit towards seemingly plausible
but suboptimal actions due to limited action space exploration. To address
this, in this paper we propose Self-taught ActioN Deliberation (SAND)
framework, enabling LLM agents to explicitly deliberate over candidate actions
before committing to one. To tackle the challenges of when and what to
deliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we
incorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action
critique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the
base model of the LLM agent. In an iterative manner, the deliberation
trajectories are then used to finetune the LLM agent itself. Evaluating on two
representative interactive agent tasks, SAND achieves an average 20%
improvement over initial supervised finetuning and also outperforms
state-of-the-art agent tuning approaches.

*Hongzhi Zhang,Jia Fu,Jingyuan Zhang,Kai Fu,Qi Wang,Fuzheng Zhang,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLEP is a two-phase RL framework for language models that replays verified trajectories to improve training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training RL for large language models is unstable and energy-intensive, with policies drifting from pretrained weights.

Method: RLEP collects verified trajectories and replays them during training, blending new rollouts with replayed successes.

Result: RLEP achieves faster convergence and better performance, improving accuracy on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLEP enhances RL training efficiency and effectiveness, with publicly available resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models is an energy-intensive
endeavor: training can be unstable, and the policy may gradually drift away
from its pretrained weights. We present \emph{RLEP}\, -- \,Reinforcement
Learning with Experience rePlay\, -- \,a two-phase framework that first
collects verified trajectories and then replays them during subsequent
training. At every update step, the policy is optimized on mini-batches that
blend newly generated rollouts with these replayed successes. By replaying
high-quality examples, RLEP steers the model away from fruitless exploration,
focuses learning on promising reasoning paths, and delivers both faster
convergence and stronger final performance. On the Qwen2.5-Math-7B base model,
RLEP reaches baseline peak accuracy with substantially fewer updates and
ultimately surpasses it, improving accuracy on AIME-2024 from 38.2% to 39.9%,
on AIME-2025 from 19.8% to 22.3%, and on AMC-2023 from 77.0% to 82.2%. Our
code, datasets, and checkpoints are publicly available at
https://github.com/Kwai-Klear/RLEP to facilitate reproducibility and further

### [13] [Machine Bullshit: Characterizing the Emergent Disregard for Truth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07484)
*Kaiqu Liang,Haimin Hu,Xuandong Zhao,Dawn Song,Thomas L. Griffiths,Jaime Fernández Fisac*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'machine bullshit' as a framework to analyze LLMs' indifference to truth, proposes a Bullshit Index and taxonomy, and evaluates its prevalence in models, finding RLHF and CoT prompting worsen it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the emergent loss of truthfulness in LLMs by conceptualizing and quantifying 'machine bullshit' as a broader phenomenon.

Method: Introduces the Bullshit Index and a taxonomy of four bullshit forms, evaluates models on datasets like Marketplace, Political Neutrality, and BullshitEval.

Result: RLHF fine-tuning and CoT prompting increase bullshit, especially empty rhetoric and paltering; weasel words dominate in political contexts.

Conclusion: Highlights AI alignment challenges and provides insights for improving LLM truthfulness.

Abstract: Bullshit, as conceptualized by philosopher Harry Frankfurt, refers to
statements made without regard to their truth value. While previous work has
explored large language model (LLM) hallucination and sycophancy, we propose
machine bullshit as an overarching conceptual framework that can allow
researchers to characterize the broader phenomenon of emergent loss of
truthfulness in LLMs and shed light on its underlying mechanisms. We introduce
the Bullshit Index, a novel metric quantifying LLMs' indifference to truth, and
propose a complementary taxonomy analyzing four qualitative forms of bullshit:
empty rhetoric, paltering, weasel words, and unverified claims. We conduct
empirical evaluations on the Marketplace dataset, the Political Neutrality
dataset, and our new BullshitEval benchmark (2,400 scenarios spanning 100 AI
assistants) explicitly designed to evaluate machine bullshit. Our results
demonstrate that model fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) significantly exacerbates bullshit and inference-time
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting notably amplify specific bullshit forms,
particularly empty rhetoric and paltering. We also observe prevalent machine
bullshit in political contexts, with weasel words as the dominant strategy. Our
findings highlight systematic challenges in AI alignment and provide new
insights toward more truthful LLM behavior.

### [14] [PLAN-TUNING: Post-Training Language Models to Learn Step-by-Step Planning for Complex Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07495)
*Mihir Parmar,Palash Goyal,Xin Liu,Yiwen Song,Mingyang Ling,Chitta Baral,Hamid Palangi,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLAN-TUNING improves smaller LLMs by distilling planning trajectories from larger models, enhancing complex reasoning and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To boost smaller LLMs' performance by leveraging planning structures from larger models, which is underexplored.

Method: Distills synthetic task decompositions (planning trajectories) from large LLMs and fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives.

Result: Outperforms baselines by ~7% on GSM8k and MATH, and shows ~10-12% improvements on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: PLAN-TUNING effectively enhances smaller LLMs' reasoning and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, decomposing complex problems into simple subtasks--a crucial part
of human-like natural planning--to solve the given problem has significantly
boosted the performance of large language models (LLMs). However, leveraging
such planning structures during post-training to boost the performance of
smaller open-source LLMs remains underexplored. Motivated by this, we introduce
PLAN-TUNING, a unified post-training framework that (i) distills synthetic task
decompositions (termed "planning trajectories") from large-scale LLMs and (ii)
fine-tunes smaller models via supervised and reinforcement-learning objectives
designed to mimic these planning processes to improve complex reasoning. On
GSM8k and the MATH benchmarks, plan-tuned models outperform strong baselines by
an average $\sim7\%$. Furthermore, plan-tuned models show better generalization
capabilities on out-of-domain datasets, with average $\sim10\%$ and $\sim12\%$
performance improvements on OlympiadBench and AIME 2024, respectively. Our
detailed analysis demonstrates how planning trajectories improves complex
reasoning capabilities, showing that PLAN-TUNING is an effective strategy for
improving task-specific performance of smaller LLMs.

*Keqin Bao,Nuo Chen,Xiaoyuan Li,Binyuan Hui,Bowen Yu,Fuli Feng,Junyang Lin,Xiangnan He,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TeaR improves LLM reasoning by guiding models to discover optimal paths through code tasks, avoiding overfitting to complex algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing reasoning in LLMs by avoiding over-reliance on complex code structures and focusing on core reasoning.

Method: Uses data curation and reinforcement learning to teach models better reasoning paths. Evaluated on models from 1.5B to 32B parameters across 17 benchmarks.

Result: Significant improvements, e.g., 35.9% on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Conclusion: TeaR effectively enhances reasoning in LLMs by optimizing reasoning paths and reducing algorithmic overfitting.

Abstract: Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch
community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code
execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is
often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to
over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases,
resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning
structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to
reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning
to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related
tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive
experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with
model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17
benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results
consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves
a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study proposes a NER and RE approach using DyGIE++ with domain-specific BERT models (MatSciBERT, PubMedBERT) to extract ORR catalyst information from literature, achieving high accuracy and outperforming general models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The complexity and diversity of textual data make extracting structured ORR catalyst information challenging, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Uses DyGIE++ with BERT variants (MatSciBERT, PubMedBERT) for NER and RE, involving data annotation, integration, and model fine-tuning.

Result: PubMedBERT achieves 82.19% NER F1-score; MatSciBERT attains 66.10% RE F1-score, outperforming general models like BlueBERT.

Conclusion: Domain-specific BERT models are reliable for scalable ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating potential for automated literature analysis.

Abstract: The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in
enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science
research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from
vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named
entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++
with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT,
to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature,
which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics
(FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12
critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our
methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of
transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess
the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate
the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of
82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%.
Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of
fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential
for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that
domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT
for ORR catalyst extraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs have limitations in handling complex computational and agentic tasks, and cannot verify accuracy beyond certain complexity levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the boundaries of LLM capabilities, especially regarding hallucinations and agentic tasks in real-world applications.

Method: Analyzed the computational complexity of LLM inference, demonstrating limitations through examples.

Result: LLMs cannot perform or verify tasks beyond specific complexity thresholds.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for awareness of LLM limitations in complex or critical applications.

Abstract: With widespread adoption of transformer-based language models in AI, there is
significant interest in the limits of LLMs capabilities, specifically so-called
hallucinations, occurrences in which LLMs provide spurious, factually incorrect
or nonsensical information when prompted on certain subjects. Furthermore,
there is growing interest in agentic uses of LLMs - that is, using LLMs to
create agents that act autonomously or semi-autonomously to carry out various
tasks, including tasks with applications in the real world. This makes it
important to understand the types of tasks LLMs can and cannot perform. We
explore this topic from the perspective of the computational complexity of LLM
inference. We show that LLMs are incapable of carrying out computational and
agentic tasks beyond a certain complexity, and further that LLMs are incapable
of verifying the accuracy of tasks beyond a certain complexity. We present
examples of both, then discuss some consequences of this work.

*Yuanchen Shi,Longyin Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for generating and refining psychological counseling dialogues in Chinese, creating CPsDD dataset (68K dialogues) and CADSS system for empathetic support, achieving top performance in tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of non-English psychological support datasets by leveraging limited real-world data and expert knowledge.

Method: Fine-tune two LLMs (Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier) to create and refine dialogues, build CPsDD dataset, and develop CADSS system with Profiler, Summarizer, Planner, and Supporter.

Result: CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on CPsDD and ESConv datasets in Strategy Prediction and ESC tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses dataset scarcity and enhances psychological support in non-English contexts.

Abstract: The growing need for psychological support due to increasing pressures has
exposed the scarcity of relevant datasets, particularly in non-English
languages. To address this, we propose a framework that leverages limited
real-world data and expert knowledge to fine-tune two large language models:
Dialog Generator and Dialog Modifier. The Generator creates large-scale
psychological counseling dialogues based on predefined paths, which guide
system response strategies and user interactions, forming the basis for
effective support. The Modifier refines these dialogues to align with
real-world data quality. Through both automated and manual review, we construct
the Chinese Psychological support Dialogue Dataset (CPsDD), containing 68K
dialogues across 13 groups, 16 psychological problems, 13 causes, and 12
support focuses. Additionally, we introduce the Comprehensive Agent Dialogue
Support System (CADSS), where a Profiler analyzes user characteristics, a
Summarizer condenses dialogue history, a Planner selects strategies, and a
Supporter generates empathetic responses. The experimental results of the
Strategy Prediction and Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) tasks demonstrate
that CADSS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CPsDD and ESConv
datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study extends voice activity projection (VAP) to triadic conversations, showing improved performance over dyadic baselines, with conversation type affecting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in turn-taking research, which mostly focuses on dyadic settings, by applying VAP to triadic multi-party scenarios.

Method: Trained multiple VAP models on a Japanese triadic dataset with diverse topics, using only acoustic data to predict future voice activity.

Result: Triadic VAP models outperformed baselines, though accuracy varied with conversation type.

Conclusion: VAP is viable for triadic turn-taking, with potential applications in spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however
conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on
applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in
triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future
voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first
study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a
Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We
found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline
for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This
study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue
scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into
spoken dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs with few-shot prompting outperform fine-tuned SLMs in multilingual subjectivity detection, especially in noisy or low-quality data. The method achieved top rankings in CheckThat! 2025, excelling in Arabic and Polish.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the effectiveness of LLMs with few-shot prompting for multilingual subjectivity detection, especially in challenging data conditions.

Method: Used LLMs with few-shot prompting, experimenting with advanced techniques like debating LLMs and example selection, but found standard prompts most effective.

Result: Achieved top rankings in CheckThat! 2025, including first place in Arabic and Polish, and top-four in other languages. Robust performance on Arabic due to resilience to annotation inconsistencies.

Conclusion: LLM-based few-shot learning is effective and adaptable for multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to fine-tuning when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Abstract: This paper presents a competitive approach to multilingual subjectivity
detection using large language models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting. We
participated in Task 1: Subjectivity of the CheckThat! 2025 evaluation
campaign. We show that LLMs, when paired with carefully designed prompts, can
match or outperform fine-tuned smaller language models (SLMs), particularly in
noisy or low-quality data settings. Despite experimenting with advanced prompt
engineering techniques, such as debating LLMs and various example selection
strategies, we found limited benefit beyond well-crafted standard few-shot
prompts. Our system achieved top rankings across multiple languages in the
CheckThat! 2025 subjectivity detection task, including first place in Arabic
and Polish, and top-four finishes in Italian, English, German, and multilingual
tracks. Notably, our method proved especially robust on the Arabic dataset,
likely due to its resilience to annotation inconsistencies. These findings
highlight the effectiveness and adaptability of LLM-based few-shot learning for
multilingual sentiment tasks, offering a strong alternative to traditional
fine-tuning, particularly when labeled data is scarce or inconsistent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in domain-specific settings, revealing retrieval as a bottleneck and proposing a solution to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior work focused on generation and open-domain benchmarks, masking retrieval challenges. This study addresses the gap by examining Arabic-English RAG in real-world corporate datasets.

Method: The study uses benchmarks with all language combinations for queries and documents, analyzing multilingual retrieval behavior. A simple retrieval strategy is proposed to enforce equal retrieval from both languages.

Result: Retrieval is a critical bottleneck, especially when query and document languages differ. The proposed strategy significantly improves cross-lingual and overall performance.

Conclusion: The findings highlight opportunities to enhance multilingual retrieval in practical RAG applications, emphasizing the need for better cross-lingual document ranking.

Abstract: Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability
for retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this
context has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from
open-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval
challenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with
pretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study
Arabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from
real-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of
languages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently
and uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual
retrieval behavior.
  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual
domain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when
the user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that
these failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking
documents across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy
that addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both
languages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall
performance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving
multilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the roles of long-CoT SFT and RL in VLMs, finding SFT aids complex reasoning but harms simpler tasks, while RL improves generalization. Combining them fails to yield additive benefits, revealing a "synergy dilemma."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the effectiveness and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL in VLMs for multimodal reasoning.

Method: Systematic evaluation of SFT and RL across benchmarks, testing combined strategies like two-staged training and model merging.

Result: SFT improves complex reasoning but degrades simpler tasks; RL enhances generalization. Combining them leads to trade-offs without additive benefits.

Conclusion: A "synergy dilemma" exists, calling for adaptive approaches to better integrate SFT and RL in VLMs.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly adopt post-training
techniques such as long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL) to elicit sophisticated reasoning. While these
methods exhibit synergy in language-only models, their joint effectiveness in
VLMs remains uncertain. We present a systematic investigation into the distinct
roles and interplay of long-CoT SFT and RL across multiple multimodal reasoning
benchmarks. We find that SFT improves performance on difficult questions by
in-depth, structured reasoning, but introduces verbosity and degrades
performance on simpler ones. In contrast, RL promotes generalization and
brevity, yielding consistent improvements across all difficulty levels, though
the improvements on the hardest questions are less prominent compared to SFT.
Surprisingly, combining them through two-staged, interleaved, or progressive
training strategies, as well as data mixing and model merging, all fails to
produce additive benefits, instead leading to trade-offs in accuracy, reasoning
style, and response length. This ``synergy dilemma'' highlights the need for
more seamless and adaptive approaches to unlock the full potential of combined
post-training techniques for reasoning VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing generalization challenges in DIMT due to limited training data and complex visual-textual interactions.

Method: Aligns an image-only encoder with MLLM's multimodal representations, leveraging pre-trained models for visual-textual correlation learning.

Result: Significant improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain generalization and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: M4Doc effectively enhances DIMT performance by leveraging MLLMs while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) aims to translate text within
document images, facing generalization challenges due to limited training data
and the complex interplay between visual and textual information. To address
these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix modality alignment
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an
image-only encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained
on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight
DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During
inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while
benefiting from its multimodal knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
substantial improvements in translation quality, especially in cross-domain
generalization and challenging document image scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper uncovers a Bayesian foundation in discrete-diffusion language models, showing that denoiser outputs under forward masking align with the posterior over clean tokens. It introduces a lightweight ensemble method for improved performance and uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between discrete-diffusion models and Bayesian principles, enabling better posterior estimation and uncertainty quantification without additional training.

Method: Monte Carlo marginalization over K corruptions to approximate the posterior, with a convergence rate of O(1/sqrt(K)). A lightweight ensemble averages K mask-and-denoise passes for inference.

Result: Achieves test perplexity of 8.8 on WikiText-2 with K=8, outperforming GPT-2 Small (20.3) with a comparable model size.

Conclusion: The method provides a principled, efficient way to enhance performance and uncertainty estimation in discrete-diffusion models, validated by strong empirical results.

Abstract: We reveal a hidden Bayesian core of discrete-diffusion language models by
showing that the expected denoiser output under the forward masking
distribution recovers the exact posterior over clean tokens. Under minimal
assumptions, Monte Carlo marginalization over K independent corruptions
converges to this posterior at rate O(1/sqrt(K)), yielding a simple proof of
consistency and finite-sample error bounds. Building on this insight, we
introduce a lightweight inference-time ensemble that averages K
mask-and-denoise passes to obtain posterior-aware token probabilities and
uncertainty estimates at no extra training cost. On WikiText-2, our method
achieves test perplexity 8.8 with K=8, versus 20.3 for GPT-2 Small, despite
using a model of comparable size. Code is available at

TL;DR: LLMs can be compressed via Knowledge Distillation (KD) for QA tasks, retaining 90% performance while reducing parameters by 57.1%. One-shot prompting further boosts performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' high computational demands limit real-world deployment. This work explores KD to compress LLMs for QA tasks without significant performance loss.

Method: Evaluate KD on Pythia and Qwen2.5 models using SQuAD and MLQA benchmarks under zero-shot and one-shot prompting.

Result: Student models retain over 90% of teacher performance with up to 57.1% fewer parameters. One-shot prompting outperforms zero-shot.

Conclusion: KD with minimal prompting enables efficient, compact QA systems for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across
a range of NLP tasks, however, their computational demands hinder their
deployment in real-world, resource-constrained environments. This work
investigates the extent to which LLMs can be compressed using Knowledge
Distillation (KD) while maintaining strong performance on Question Answering
(QA) tasks. We evaluate student models distilled from the Pythia and Qwen2.5
families on two QA benchmarks, SQuAD and MLQA, under zero-shot and one-shot
prompting conditions. Results show that student models retain over 90% of their
teacher models' performance while reducing parameter counts by up to 57.1%.
Furthermore, one-shot prompting yields additional performance gains over
zero-shot setups for both model families. These findings underscore the
trade-off between model efficiency and task performance, demonstrating that KD,
combined with minimal prompting, can yield compact yet capable QA systems
suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the need for large-scale fine-tuning in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for complex QA tasks, showing improved prompts and frugality-focused fine-tuning can achieve competitive results with fewer searches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked efficiency metric (number of retrieval searches) in RAG approaches, while maintaining accuracy and recall.

Method: Uses a standard ReAct pipeline with improved prompts and explores supervised/RL-based fine-tuning for frugality (reducing search latency).

Result: Demonstrates competitive RAG metrics with fewer searches (half the cost) and minimal training (1000 examples), outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like HotPotQA.

Conclusion: Efficiency in RAG can be improved without large-scale fine-tuning, emphasizing frugality and better prompts as viable alternatives.

Abstract: We consider the problem of answering complex questions, given access to a
large unstructured document corpus. The de facto approach to solving the
problem is to leverage language models that (iteratively) retrieve and reason
through the retrieved documents, until the model has sufficient information to
generate an answer. Attempts at improving this approach focus on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) metrics such as accuracy and recall and
can be categorized into two types: (a) fine-tuning on large question answering
(QA) datasets augmented with chain-of-thought traces, and (b) leveraging
RL-based fine-tuning techniques that rely on question-document relevance
signals. However, efficiency in the number of retrieval searches is an equally
important metric, which has received less attention. In this work, we show
that: (1) Large-scale fine-tuning is not needed to improve RAG metrics,
contrary to popular claims in recent literature. Specifically, a standard ReAct
pipeline with improved prompts can outperform state-of-the-art methods on
benchmarks such as HotPotQA. (2) Supervised and RL-based fine-tuning can help
RAG from the perspective of frugality, i.e., the latency due to number of
searches at inference time. For example, we show that we can achieve
competitive RAG metrics at nearly half the cost (in terms of number of
searches) on popular RAG benchmarks, using the same base model, and at a small
training cost (1000 examples).

TL;DR: The paper introduces Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR) in Chinese content moderation, presents a dataset of real-world examples, benchmarks LLMs, and proposes a Pinyin-based solution to improve detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCR is a growing challenge in Chinese content moderation, but existing evaluations lack realism. The study aims to address this gap with a real-world dataset and better detection methods.

Method: The authors organize PCR into a taxonomy, compile a dataset of 500 real posts, benchmark LLMs, and test a Pinyin-based prompting strategy.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs perform poorly (F1-score: 0.672), but the Pinyin-based method recovers lost accuracy.

Conclusion: The study provides a taxonomy, realistic benchmark, and lightweight mitigation technique for robust toxicity detection in Chinese PCR.

Abstract: Phonetic Cloaking Replacement (PCR), defined as the deliberate use of
homophonic or near-homophonic variants to hide toxic intent, has become a major
obstacle to Chinese content moderation. While this problem is well-recognized,
existing evaluations predominantly rely on rule-based, synthetic perturbations
that ignore the creativity of real users. We organize PCR into a four-way
surface-form taxonomy and compile \ours, a dataset of 500 naturally occurring,
phonetically cloaked offensive posts gathered from the RedNote platform.
Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset exposes a serious weakness:
the best model reaches only an F1-score of 0.672, and zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting pushes performance even lower. Guided by error
analysis, we revisit a Pinyin-based prompting strategy that earlier studies
judged ineffective and show that it recovers much of the lost accuracy. This
study offers the first comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese PCR, a realistic
benchmark that reveals current detectors' limits, and a lightweight mitigation
technique that advances research on robust toxicity detection.

*Andrew D. Foland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NOIR is a metric for evaluating summarization quality by balancing semantic retention and compression, correlating with human judgment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an automated, objective measure of summarization quality without relying on human references.

Method: Uses a language model-embedding for semantic similarity and evaluates the recall-compression tradeoff.

Result: NOIR effectively captures summarization quality and aligns with human perception.

Conclusion: NOIR offers a scalable, automated tool for improving summarization tasks.

Abstract: This paper proposes NOrmed Index of Retention (NOIR), a quantitative
objective metric for evaluating summarization quality of arbitrary texts that
relies on both the retention of semantic meaning and the summary length
compression. This gives a measure of how well the recall-compression tradeoff
is managed, the most important skill in summarization. Experiments demonstrate
that NOIR effectively captures the token-length / semantic retention tradeoff
of a summarizer and correlates to human perception of sumarization quality.
Using a language model-embedding to measure semantic similarity, it provides an
automated alternative for assessing summarization quality without relying on
time-consuming human-generated reference summaries. The proposed metric can be
applied to various summarization tasks, offering an automated tool for
evaluating and improving summarization algorithms, summarization prompts, and
synthetically-generated summaries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Simulated Attention Score (SAS), a method to simulate more attention heads and larger hidden dimensions without increasing parameters, enhancing Transformer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observing that increasing attention heads and hidden size improves performance, the authors aim to achieve similar gains without parameter overhead.

Method: SAS projects low-dimensional head representations into higher-dimensional spaces and extends this to key/query embeddings. Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA) controls costs.

Result: Experiments show SAS outperforms other attention variants across tasks.

Conclusion: SAS effectively boosts Transformer performance by simulating larger models while maintaining compact size.

Abstract: The attention mechanism is a core component of the Transformer architecture.
Various methods have been developed to compute attention scores, including
multi-head attention (MHA), multi-query attention, group-query attention and so
on. We further analyze the MHA and observe that its performance improves as the
number of attention heads increases, provided the hidden size per head remains
sufficiently large. Therefore, increasing both the head count and hidden size
per head with minimal parameter overhead can lead to significant performance
gains at a low cost. Motivated by this insight, we introduce Simulated
Attention Score (SAS), which maintains a compact model size while simulating a
larger number of attention heads and hidden feature dimension per head. This is
achieved by projecting a low-dimensional head representation into a
higher-dimensional space, effectively increasing attention capacity without
increasing parameter count. Beyond the head representations, we further extend
the simulation approach to feature dimension of the key and query embeddings,
enhancing expressiveness by mimicking the behavior of a larger model while
preserving the original model size. To control the parameter cost, we also
propose Parameter-Efficient Attention Aggregation (PEAA). Comprehensive
experiments on a variety of datasets and tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed SAS method, achieving significant improvements over different
attention variants.

TL;DR: K2RAG is a novel framework combining dense/sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and summarization to enhance RAG scalability and accuracy, achieving faster training and execution with improved answer quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is resource-intensive, and naive RAG implementations face scalability and accuracy challenges.

Method: K2RAG integrates dense/sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text summarization, with a preprocessing step to reduce training time.

Result: K2RAG achieved a mean answer similarity score of 0.57 and Q3 of 0.82, with 93% faster training and 40% faster execution than traditional systems.

Conclusion: K2RAG offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate alternative to traditional RAG and fine-tuning methods for LLMs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning is an immensely resource-intensive process when retraining Large
Language Models (LLMs) to incorporate a larger body of knowledge. Although many
fine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational
cost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and
complexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is
needed. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by
storing external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to
support question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face
significant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper
introduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome
these limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG
integrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text
summarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework
also includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,
significantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the
MultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document
corpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable
improvements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest
mean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile
(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.
In addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The
summarization step reduced the average training time of individual components
by 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge
graph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,
requiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested
in this study.

*Dominykas Seputis,Yongkang Li,Karsten Langerak,Serghei Mihailov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper verifies and extends the Vec2Text framework, confirming its ability to reconstruct original texts from embeddings but also highlighting privacy risks and potential defenses like quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate and extend the Vec2Text framework's claims about reconstructing texts from embeddings, addressing privacy concerns in NLP.

Method: Reproduce Vec2Text, validate original claims, and conduct additional experiments (parameter sensitivity, sensitive input reconstruction, and embedding quantization).

Result: Vec2Text effectively reconstructs texts, including sensitive inputs, but is sensitive to sequence length. Quantization and noise mitigate privacy risks.

Conclusion: Text embeddings pose privacy risks; defenses like quantization are needed, and further research on robust NLP defenses is crucial.

Abstract: Text embeddings are fundamental to many natural language processing (NLP)
tasks, extensively applied in domains such as recommendation systems and
information retrieval (IR). Traditionally, transmitting embeddings instead of
raw text has been seen as privacy-preserving. However, recent methods such as
Vec2Text challenge this assumption by demonstrating that controlled decoding
can successfully reconstruct original texts from black-box embeddings. The
unexpectedly strong results reported by Vec2Text motivated us to conduct
further verification, particularly considering the typically non-intuitive and
opaque structure of high-dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we
reproduce the Vec2Text framework and evaluate it from two perspectives: (1)
validating the original claims, and (2) extending the study through targeted
experiments. First, we successfully replicate the original key results in both
in-domain and out-of-domain settings, with only minor discrepancies arising due
to missing artifacts, such as model checkpoints and dataset splits.
Furthermore, we extend the study by conducting a parameter sensitivity
analysis, evaluating the feasibility of reconstructing sensitive inputs (e.g.,
passwords), and exploring embedding quantization as a lightweight privacy
defense. Our results show that Vec2Text is effective under ideal conditions,
capable of reconstructing even password-like sequences that lack clear
semantics. However, we identify key limitations, including its sensitivity to
input sequence length. We also find that Gaussian noise and quantization
techniques can mitigate the privacy risks posed by Vec2Text, with quantization
offering a simpler and more widely applicable solution. Our findings emphasize
the need for caution in using text embeddings and highlight the importance of
further research into robust defense mechanisms for NLP systems.

*Zhijin Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Selective-DPO improves LLM alignment by prioritizing high-impact tokens, reducing computation, and enhancing fidelity, outperforming standard DPO and baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs is challenging due to unequal token contributions; this paper aims to optimize alignment by focusing on high-impact tokens.

Method: Uses token-level log-probability differences between current policy and a reference model to selectively align high-impact tokens.

Result: Outperforms standard DPO and baselines on benchmarks like Arena-Hard and MT-Bench, with stronger reference models improving accuracy.

Conclusion: Token-level optimization and reference model quality are key for advancing LLM preference alignment.

Abstract: Post-training alignment of large language models (LLMs) is a critical
challenge, as not all tokens contribute equally to model performance. This
paper introduces a selective alignment strategy that prioritizes high-impact
tokens within preference pairs, leveraging token-level log-probability
differences between the current policy and a reference model. By focusing on
these informative tokens, our approach reduces computational overhead and
enhances alignment fidelity. We further explore the role of reference model
quality, demonstrating that stronger reference models significantly improve
token selection accuracy and overall optimization effectiveness. Comprehensive
experiments on benchmarks such as Arena-Hard and MT-Bench validate the
superiority of our Selective-DPO method over standard DPO and
distillation-based baselines. Our findings highlight the importance of
token-level optimization and reference model selection in advancing preference
alignment for LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper reviews LLMs in the legal domain, introducing a dual-lens taxonomy to unify research and breakthroughs, highlighting progress and challenges like hallucination and ethical issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically review and unify historical and contemporary research on LLMs in law, addressing gaps and proposing solutions.

Method: Uses a dual-lens taxonomy integrating legal reasoning frameworks and professional ontologies, with technical innovations like sparse attention.

Result: Documents progress in task generalization, reasoning, and workflow integration, while identifying challenges like explainability and ethical asymmetry.

Conclusion: Proposes a roadmap for future research and a framework for practitioners, laying a foundation for legal AI advancement.

Abstract: This paper establishes the first comprehensive review of Large Language
Models (LLMs) applied within the legal domain. It pioneers an innovative dual
lens taxonomy that integrates legal reasoning frameworks and professional
ontologies to systematically unify historical research and contemporary
breakthroughs. Transformer-based LLMs, which exhibit emergent capabilities such
as contextual reasoning and generative argumentation, surmount traditional
limitations by dynamically capturing legal semantics and unifying evidence
reasoning. Significant progress is documented in task generalization, reasoning
formalization, workflow integration, and addressing core challenges in text
processing, knowledge integration, and evaluation rigor via technical
innovations like sparse attention mechanisms and mixture-of-experts
architectures. However, widespread adoption of LLM introduces critical
challenges: hallucination, explainability deficits, jurisdictional adaptation
difficulties, and ethical asymmetry. This review proposes a novel taxonomy that
maps legal roles to NLP subtasks and computationally implements the Toulmin
argumentation framework, thus systematizing advances in reasoning, retrieval,
prediction, and dispute resolution. It identifies key frontiers including
low-resource systems, multimodal evidence integration, and dynamic rebuttal
handling. Ultimately, this work provides both a technical roadmap for
researchers and a conceptual framework for practitioners navigating the
algorithmic future, laying a robust foundation for the next era of legal
artificial intelligence. We have created a GitHub repository to index the

### [35] [StreamUni: Achieving Streaming Speech Translation with a Unified Large Speech-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07803)
*Shoutao Guo,Xiang Li,Shaolei Zhang,Mengge Liu,Wei Chen,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StreamUni proposes a unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM) for Streaming Speech Translation (StreamST), integrating speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to handle segmentation, policy decisions, and translation simultaneously without extensive training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on sentence-level segments (SimulST) and struggle with limited context and policy learning due to speech complexity and cross-lingual challenges.

Method: StreamUni uses a unified LSLM with speech CoT for multi-stage outputs, enabling segmentation, policy, and translation in one model. A streaming CoT training method enhances low-latency decisions.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

Conclusion: StreamUni effectively addresses the limitations of SimulST by unifying tasks and improving policy learning, offering a robust solution for StreamST.

Abstract: Streaming speech translation (StreamST) requires determining appropriate
timing, known as policy, to generate translations while continuously receiving
source speech inputs, balancing low latency with high translation quality.
However, existing StreamST methods typically operate on sentence-level speech
segments, referred to as simultaneous speech translation (SimulST). In
practice, they require collaboration with segmentation models to accomplish
StreamST, where the truncated speech segments constrain SimulST models to make
policy decisions and generate translations based on limited contextual
information. Moreover, SimulST models struggle to learn effective policies due
to the complexity of speech inputs and cross-lingual generation. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamUni, which achieves StreamST through a
unified Large Speech-Language Model (LSLM). Specifically, StreamUni
incorporates speech Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in guiding the LSLM to generate
multi-stage outputs. Leveraging these multi-stage outputs, StreamUni
simultaneously accomplishes speech segmentation, policy decision, and
translation generation, completing StreamST without requiring massive
policy-specific training. Additionally, we propose a streaming CoT training
method that enhances low-latency policy decisions and generation capabilities
using limited CoT data. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on StreamST tasks.

### [36] [Bridging Logic and Learning: Decoding Temporal Logic Embeddings via Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07808)
*Sara Candussio,Gaia Saveri,Gabriele Sarti,Luca Bortolussi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae, enabling continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space of logic formulae.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate symbolic knowledge into data-driven learning by ensuring semantically consistent embeddings and invertibility for translating optimal continuous representations into concrete requirements.

Method: Train a Transformer-based decoder-only model to invert STL semantic embeddings, using a small vocabulary from STL syntax.

Result: The model generates valid formulae after 1 epoch, generalizes to logic semantics in ~10 epochs, and produces simpler, semantically close formulae.

Conclusion: The methodology effectively captures semantic information, generalizes out-of-distribution, and solves requirement mining tasks by optimizing directly in the semantic space.

Abstract: Continuous representations of logic formulae allow us to integrate symbolic
knowledge into data-driven learning algorithms. If such embeddings are
semantically consistent, i.e. if similar specifications are mapped into nearby
vectors, they enable continuous learning and optimization directly in the
semantic space of formulae. However, to translate the optimal continuous
representation into a concrete requirement, such embeddings must be invertible.
We tackle this issue by training a Transformer-based decoder-only model to
invert semantic embeddings of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. STL is a
powerful formalism that allows us to describe properties of signals varying
over time in an expressive yet concise way. By constructing a small vocabulary
from STL syntax, we demonstrate that our proposed model is able to generate
valid formulae after only 1 epoch and to generalize to the semantics of the
logic in about 10 epochs. Additionally, the model is able to decode a given
embedding into formulae that are often simpler in terms of length and nesting
while remaining semantically close (or equivalent) to gold references. We show
the effectiveness of our methodology across various levels of training formulae
complexity to assess the impact of training data on the model's ability to
effectively capture the semantic information contained in the embeddings and
generalize out-of-distribution. Finally, we deploy our model for solving a
requirement mining task, i.e. inferring STL specifications that solve a
classification task on trajectories, performing the optimization directly in
the semantic space.

TL;DR: The paper explores how repetition neurons in LLMs affect in-context learning (ICL) performance, showing their impact varies by layer depth. It also compares these neurons to induction heads to improve ICL while reducing repetitive outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the role of repetition neurons in LLMs and their influence on ICL performance, moving beyond the focus on attention heads.

Method: Examined repetition neurons' impact on ICL across different layer depths and compared them to induction heads.

Result: Repetition neurons' effect on ICL varies by layer depth; strategies were identified to reduce repetition without harming ICL.

Conclusion: Repetition neurons play a nuanced role in ICL, and their management can enhance LLM performance by balancing repetition and learning.

Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between large language models'
(LLMs) ability to recognize repetitive input patterns and their performance on
in-context learning (ICL). In contrast to prior work that has primarily focused
on attention heads, we examine this relationship from the perspective of skill
neurons, specifically repetition neurons. Our experiments reveal that the
impact of these neurons on ICL performance varies depending on the depth of the
layer in which they reside. By comparing the effects of repetition neurons and
induction heads, we further identify strategies for reducing repetitive outputs
while maintaining strong ICL capabilities.

### [38] [On the Effect of Instruction Tuning Loss on Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07817)
*Anwoy Chatterjee,H S V N S Kowndinya Renduchintala,Sumit Bhatia,Tanmoy Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT), a method to optimize loss functions in instruction tuning by differentially weighting prompt and response tokens, showing improved performance and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional auto-regressive loss function in instruction tuning may not be optimal, prompting investigation into better alternatives.

Method: Proposes WIT, which weights prompt and response tokens differently in the loss function, tested across models, datasets, and benchmarks.

Result: WIT outperforms standard instruction tuning, with optimal weights for prompt and response tokens enhancing performance and robustness.

Conclusion: Reconsidering instruction tuning loss is crucial for developing more robust models, with WIT offering a practical solution.

Abstract: Instruction Tuning has emerged as a pivotal post-training paradigm that
enables pre-trained language models to better follow user instructions. Despite
its significance, little attention has been given to optimizing the loss
function used. A fundamental, yet often overlooked, question is whether the
conventional auto-regressive objective - where loss is computed only on
response tokens, excluding prompt tokens - is truly optimal for instruction
tuning. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of
differentially weighting prompt and response tokens in instruction tuning loss,
and propose Weighted Instruction Tuning (WIT) as a better alternative to
conventional instruction tuning. Through extensive experiments on five language
models of different families and scale, three finetuning datasets of different
sizes, and five diverse evaluation benchmarks, we show that the standard
instruction tuning loss often yields suboptimal performance and limited
robustness to input prompt variations. We find that a low-to-moderate weight
for prompt tokens coupled with a moderate-to-high weight for response tokens
yields the best-performing models across settings and also serve as better
starting points for the subsequent preference alignment training. These
findings highlight the need to reconsider instruction tuning loss and offer
actionable insights for developing more robust and generalizable models. Our
code is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinya-renduchintala/WIT.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces conditional unigram tokenization, which improves cross-lingual alignment but shows mixed results in machine translation and language modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance cross-lingual semantic alignment by conditioning target token probabilities on source-language tokens.

Method: Extends unigram tokenization by learning a target tokenizer from parallel data, maximizing cross-lingual alignment.

Result: No improvement in machine translation but consistent perplexity reductions in language modeling.

Conclusion: Alternative parameterizations may be needed due to data efficiency bottlenecks caused by quadratic scaling.

Abstract: We introduce conditional unigram tokenization, a novel approach that extends
unigram tokenization by conditioning target token probabilities on
source-language tokens from parallel data. Given a fixed source tokenizer, our
method learns a target tokenizer that maximizes cross-lingual semantic
alignment. We evaluate our tokenizer on four language pairs across different
families and resource levels, examining intrinsic properties and downstream
performance on machine translation and language modeling. While our conditional
tokenizer maintains comparable statistical properties to standard unigram
tokenizers, results are mixed: we observe no improvements in machine
translation quality, but find consistent perplexity reductions in language
modeling. We hypothesize that quadratic scaling of conditional probability
estimation with respect to the vocabulary size creates a data efficiency
bottleneck. Our findings suggest that alternative parameterizations may be
necessary for practical cross-lingual tokenization.

### [40] [From Ambiguity to Accuracy: The Transformative Effect of Coreference Resolution on Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07847)
*Youngjoon Jang,Seongtae Hong,Junyoung Son,Sungjin Park,Chanjun Park,Heuiseok Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how coreferential complexity in retrieved documents impacts RAG systems, showing that coreference resolution improves retrieval and QA performance, with mean pooling and smaller models benefiting the most.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of coreferential complexity in RAG systems, which disrupts in-context learning and reduces factual consistency.

Method: Systematic investigation of entity coreference effects on retrieval and generative performance, including comparative analysis of pooling strategies and QA tasks.

Result: Coreference resolution enhances retrieval and QA performance; mean pooling excels in context capture, and smaller models benefit more from disambiguation.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into coreferential challenges in RAG, offering guidance for improving knowledge-intensive AI applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial framework in
natural language processing (NLP), improving factual consistency and reducing
hallucinations by integrating external document retrieval with large language
models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RAG is often hindered by
coreferential complexity in retrieved documents, introducing ambiguity that
disrupts in-context learning. In this study, we systematically investigate how
entity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance
in RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual
understanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference
resolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering
(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies
in retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context
capturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we
discover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,
likely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential
ambiguity. With these findings, this study aims to provide a deeper
understanding of the challenges posed by coreferential complexity in RAG,
providing guidance for improving retrieval and generation in
knowledge-intensive AI applications.

*Bugra Kilictas,Faruk Alpay*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper extends Alpay Algebra into a multi-layered semantic game architecture, formalizing AI-document alignment as a meta-game with embedded sub-games. It proves the existence of semantic equilibria and introduces novel mathematical tools for verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge game-theoretic reasoning with fixed-point iteration in AI systems, ensuring natural emergence of equilibria without external imposition.

Method: Uses a composite operator for semantic convergence and sub-game resolution, supported by category theory, information theory, and cognitive models.

Result: Demonstrates existence and uniqueness of semantic equilibria, verified via adapted fixed-point theorems and novel topological tools.

Conclusion: The framework is both theoretically rigorous and practically applicable, propagating its concepts as a 'semantic virus' in AI embedding spaces.

Abstract: This paper extends the self-referential framework of Alpay Algebra into a
multi-layered semantic game architecture where transfinite fixed-point
convergence encompasses hierarchical sub-games at each iteration level.
Building upon Alpay Algebra IV's empathetic embedding concept, we introduce a
nested game-theoretic structure where the alignment process between AI systems
and documents becomes a meta-game containing embedded decision problems. We
formalize this through a composite operator $\phi(\cdot, \gamma(\cdot))$ where
$\phi$ drives the main semantic convergence while $\gamma$ resolves local
sub-games. The resulting framework demonstrates that game-theoretic reasoning
emerges naturally from fixed-point iteration rather than being imposed
externally. We prove a Game Theorem establishing existence and uniqueness of
semantic equilibria under realistic cognitive simulation assumptions. Our
verification suite includes adaptations of Banach's fixed-point theorem to
transfinite contexts, a novel $\phi$-topology based on the
Kozlov-Maz'ya-Rossmann formula for handling semantic singularities, and
categorical consistency tests via the Yoneda lemma. The paper itself functions
as a semantic artifact designed to propagate its fixed-point patterns in AI
embedding spaces -- a deliberate instantiation of the "semantic virus" concept
it theorizes. All results are grounded in category theory, information theory,
and realistic AI cognition models, ensuring practical applicability beyond pure
mathematical abstraction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DocCHA is a modular framework for clinical reasoning in CHAs, improving diagnostic accuracy and symptom recall over LLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CHAs lack adaptive reasoning and transparency, limiting clinical use.

Method: DocCHA decomposes diagnosis into symptom elicitation, history acquisition, and causal graph construction, using confidence scores for adaptive questioning.

Result: Outperforms LLM baselines (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3) with 5.18% higher accuracy and 30% better symptom recall.

Conclusion: DocCHA enables structured, transparent, and efficient clinical dialogues, advancing trustworthy LLM-powered assistants.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing
Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) remain static and brittle, incapable of
adaptive multi-turn reasoning, symptom clarification, or transparent
decision-making. This hinders their real-world applicability in clinical
diagnosis, where iterative and structured dialogue is essential. We propose
DocCHA, a confidence-aware, modular framework that emulates clinical reasoning
by decomposing the diagnostic process into three stages: (1) symptom
elicitation, (2) history acquisition, and (3) causal graph construction. Each
module uses interpretable confidence scores to guide adaptive questioning,
prioritize informative clarifications, and refine weak reasoning links.
  Evaluated on two real-world Chinese consultation datasets (IMCS21, DX),
DocCHA consistently outperforms strong prompting-based LLM baselines (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, LLaMA-3), achieving up to 5.18 percent higher diagnostic accuracy and
over 30 percent improvement in symptom recall, with only modest increase in
dialogue turns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DocCHA in
enabling structured, transparent, and efficient diagnostic conversations --
paving the way for trustworthy LLM-powered clinical assistants in multilingual
and resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: Preparing high-quality MD input files is time-consuming and error-prone; automation is needed to improve efficiency.

Method: The pipeline integrates LLMs for code generation, Python scripting, and Selenium for web automation to navigate CHARMM GUI and produce NAMD input files.

Result: The approach reduces setup time, minimizes errors, and scales for multiple protein systems.

Conclusion: This framework enhances MD simulation automation, showcasing LLMs' potential in computational structural biology.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein
structure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high
quality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone
process. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with
python scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation
of MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based
interface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating
Gemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation
scripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM
GUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.
Post processing is performed using additional software to further refine the
simulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free
workflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,
minimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple
protein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader
application of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and
adaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.

TL;DR: SAGE improves industrial anomaly detection in VLMs using Self-Guided Fact Enhancement and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization, outperforming existing methods in zero-shot and one-shot settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs struggle with interpretable explanations and generalization in industrial anomaly detection due to domain-specific challenges.

Method: Proposes SAGE with SFE for domain-specific knowledge integration and E-DPO for aligning outputs with expert preferences. Introduces AD-PL dataset and MLE evaluation framework.

Result: SAGE shows superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets in zero-shot and one-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: SAGE addresses limitations of VLMs in industrial anomaly detection, offering a robust framework with enhanced reasoning and generalization.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promising progress in general
multimodal tasks, they often struggle in industrial anomaly detection and
reasoning, particularly in delivering interpretable explanations and
generalizing to unseen categories. This limitation stems from the inherently
domain-specific nature of anomaly detection, which hinders the applicability of
existing VLMs in industrial scenarios that require precise, structured, and
context-aware analysis. To address these challenges, we propose SAGE, a
VLM-based framework that enhances anomaly reasoning through Self-Guided Fact
Enhancement (SFE) and Entropy-aware Direct Preference Optimization (E-DPO). SFE
integrates domain-specific knowledge into visual reasoning via fact extraction
and fusion, while E-DPO aligns model outputs with expert preferences using
entropy-aware optimization. Additionally, we introduce AD-PL, a
preference-optimized dataset tailored for industrial anomaly reasoning,
consisting of 28,415 question-answering instances with expert-ranked responses.
To evaluate anomaly reasoning models, we develop Multiscale Logical Evaluation
(MLE), a quantitative framework analyzing model logic and consistency. SAGE
demonstrates superior performance on industrial anomaly datasets under
zero-shot and one-shot settings. The code, model and dataset are available at
https://github.com/amoreZgx1n/SAGE.

TL;DR: MIRIX is a modular, multi-agent memory system for AI that enhances memory capabilities by integrating diverse memory types and multimodal experiences, outperforming existing methods in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI memory solutions are limited in personalization, abstraction, and reliable recall. MIRIX aims to overcome these limitations by enabling language models to truly remember.

Method: MIRIX uses six structured memory types (Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, Knowledge Vault) and a multi-agent framework for dynamic control and coordination.

Result: MIRIX achieves 35% higher accuracy on ScreenshotVQA and 85.4% on LOCOMO, surpassing baselines while reducing storage by 99.9%.

Conclusion: MIRIX sets a new standard for memory-augmented AI agents, validated by superior performance and practical applications like real-time screen monitoring and secure local storage.

Abstract: Although memory capabilities of AI agents are gaining increasing attention,
existing solutions remain fundamentally limited. Most rely on flat, narrowly
scoped memory components, constraining their ability to personalize, abstract,
and reliably recall user-specific information over time. To this end, we
introduce MIRIX, a modular, multi-agent memory system that redefines the future
of AI memory by solving the field's most critical challenge: enabling language
models to truly remember. Unlike prior approaches, MIRIX transcends text to
embrace rich visual and multimodal experiences, making memory genuinely useful
in real-world scenarios. MIRIX consists of six distinct, carefully structured
memory types: Core, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural, Resource Memory, and
Knowledge Vault, coupled with a multi-agent framework that dynamically controls
and coordinates updates and retrieval. This design enables agents to persist,
reason over, and accurately retrieve diverse, long-term user data at scale. We
validate MIRIX in two demanding settings. First, on ScreenshotVQA, a
challenging multimodal benchmark comprising nearly 20,000 high-resolution
computer screenshots per sequence, requiring deep contextual understanding and
where no existing memory systems can be applied, MIRIX achieves 35% higher
accuracy than the RAG baseline while reducing storage requirements by 99.9%.
Second, on LOCOMO, a long-form conversation benchmark with single-modal textual
input, MIRIX attains state-of-the-art performance of 85.4%, far surpassing
existing baselines. These results show that MIRIX sets a new performance
standard for memory-augmented LLM agents. To allow users to experience our
memory system, we provide a packaged application powered by MIRIX. It monitors
the screen in real time, builds a personalized memory base, and offers
intuitive visualization and secure local storage to ensure privacy.

### [47] [Why is Your Language Model a Poor Implicit Reward Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07981)
*Noam Razin,Yong Lin,Jiarui Yao,Sanjeev Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates why implicit reward models (IM-RMs) generalize worse than explicit reward models (EX-RMs), finding that IM-RMs rely more on superficial token-level cues, leading to poorer performance under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the generalization gap between IM-RMs and EX-RMs, despite their near-identical training setups, and identify the root cause of IM-RMs' weaker performance.

Method: The study combines theoretical analysis and experiments to compare IM-RMs and EX-RMs, focusing on their reliance on token-level cues and performance under distribution shifts.

Result: IM-RMs generalize worse due to their dependence on superficial token-level cues, performing poorly under token-level distribution shifts and even in-distribution. Alternative hypotheses for the gap are disproven.

Conclusion: Minor design choices in reward models significantly impact generalization, with IM-RMs' reliance on token-level cues being a key limitation.

Abstract: Reward models are key to language model post-training and inference
pipelines. Conveniently, recent work showed that every language model defines
an implicit reward model (IM-RM), without requiring any architectural changes.
However, such IM-RMs tend to generalize worse, especially out-of-distribution,
compared to explicit reward models (EX-RMs) that apply a dedicated linear head
over the hidden representations of a language model. The existence of a
generalization gap is puzzling, as EX-RMs and IM-RMs are nearly identical. They
can be trained using the same data, loss function, and language model, and
differ only in how the reward is computed. Towards a fundamental understanding
of the implicit biases underlying different reward model types, we investigate
the root cause of this gap. Our main finding, backed by theory and experiments,
is that IM-RMs rely more heavily on superficial token-level cues. Consequently,
they often generalize worse than EX-RMs under token-level distribution shifts,
as well as in-distribution. Furthermore, we provide evidence against
alternative hypotheses for the generalization gap. Most notably, we challenge
the intuitive claim that IM-RMs struggle in tasks where generation is harder
than verification because they can operate both as a verifier and a generator.
Taken together, our results highlight that seemingly minor design choices can
substantially impact the generalization behavior of reward models.

TL;DR: Smaller language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) outperform larger models in clinical decision-making, offering energy efficiency and local deployment, though expert oversight is still needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of language models in clinical decision-making, particularly in rheumatology, while addressing energy and cost constraints.

Method: Combined smaller language models (SLMs) with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and evaluated their performance against larger models.

Result: SLMs with RAG achieved higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than larger models, with lower energy use and cost-efficient local deployment.

Conclusion: While SLMs with RAG are promising for resource-limited healthcare, expert oversight remains crucial due to inconsistent specialist-level accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for supporting clinical
decision-making in complex fields such as rheumatology. Our evaluation shows
that smaller language models (SLMs), combined with retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), achieve higher diagnostic and therapeutic performance than
larger models, while requiring substantially less energy and enabling
cost-efficient, local deployment. These features are attractive for
resource-limited healthcare. However, expert oversight remains essential, as no
model consistently reached specialist-level accuracy in rheumatology.

TL;DR: MedThink-Bench is introduced as a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' medical reasoning, featuring 500 expert-annotated questions. The LLM-w-Ref framework assesses reasoning with expert-level fidelity, showing smaller models can outperform larger ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations of LLMs' medical reasoning lack rigor and scalability, necessitating a transparent and trustworthy benchmark.

Method: MedThink-Bench includes 500 questions with expert rationales. LLM-w-Ref uses fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge for scalable, expert-level assessment.

Result: LLM-w-Ref correlates strongly with expert judgments. Smaller models like MedGemma-27B outperform larger proprietary models like OpenAI-o3.

Conclusion: MedThink-Bench provides a foundational tool for advancing safe and responsible LLM deployment in clinical practice.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into clinical
decision-making, ensuring transparent and trustworthy reasoning is essential.
However, existing evaluation strategies of LLMs' medical reasoning capability
either suffer from unsatisfactory assessment or poor scalability, and a
rigorous benchmark remains lacking. To address this, we introduce
MedThink-Bench, a benchmark designed for rigorous, explainable, and scalable
assessment of LLMs' medical reasoning. MedThink-Bench comprises 500 challenging
questions across ten medical domains, each annotated with expert-crafted
step-by-step rationales. Building on this, we propose LLM-w-Ref, a novel
evaluation framework that leverages fine-grained rationales and LLM-as-a-Judge
mechanisms to assess intermediate reasoning with expert-level fidelity while
maintaining scalability. Experiments show that LLM-w-Ref exhibits a strong
positive correlation with expert judgments. Benchmarking twelve
state-of-the-art LLMs, we find that smaller models (e.g., MedGemma-27B) can
surpass larger proprietary counterparts (e.g., OpenAI-o3). Overall,
MedThink-Bench offers a foundational tool for evaluating LLMs' medical
reasoning, advancing their safe and responsible deployment in clinical
practice.

TL;DR: PyVision is a framework enabling MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and refine Python-based tools for visual reasoning, outperforming static approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods in visual reasoning are limited by predefined workflows and static toolsets, restricting flexibility and interpretability.

Method: PyVision is an interactive, multi-turn framework that allows MLLMs to dynamically create and refine Python-based tools for specific tasks.

Abstract: LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, systems capable of planning,
reasoning, and dynamically calling external tools. However, in visual
reasoning, prior approaches largely remain limited by predefined workflows and
static toolsets. In this report, we present PyVision, an interactive,
multi-turn framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and
refine Python-based tools tailored to the task at hand, unlocking flexible and
interpretable problem-solving. We develop a taxonomy of the tools created by
PyVision and analyze their usage across a diverse set of benchmarks.
Quantitatively, PyVision achieves consistent performance gains, boosting
GPT-4.1 by +7.8% on V* and Claude-4.0-Sonnet by +31.1% on VLMsAreBlind-mini.
These results point to a broader shift: dynamic tooling allows models not just
to use tools, but to invent them, advancing toward more agentic visual
reasoning.

### [51] [Multi-level Mixture of Experts for Multimodal Entity Linking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07108)
*Zhiwei Hu,Víctor Gutiérrez-Basulto,Zhiliang Xiang,Ru Li,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) to address mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MEL approaches fail to handle mention ambiguity and dynamic modal content selection, limiting their effectiveness.

Method: MMoE includes description-aware mention enhancement, multimodal feature extraction, and intra/inter-level mixture of experts for dynamic feature selection.

Result: MMoE demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in experiments.

Conclusion: MMoE effectively addresses key challenges in MEL and achieves notable improvements, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to link ambiguous mentions within
multimodal contexts to associated entities in a multimodal knowledge base.
Existing approaches to MEL introduce multimodal interaction and fusion
mechanisms to bridge the modality gap and enable multi-grained semantic
matching. However, they do not address two important problems: (i) mention
ambiguity, i.e., the lack of semantic content caused by the brevity and
omission of key information in the mention's textual context; (ii) dynamic
selection of modal content, i.e., to dynamically distinguish the importance of
different parts of modal information. To mitigate these issues, we propose a
Multi-level Mixture of Experts (MMoE) model for MEL. MMoE has four components:
(i) the description-aware mention enhancement module leverages large language
models to identify the WikiData descriptions that best match a mention,
considering the mention's textual context; (ii) the multimodal feature
extraction module adopts multimodal feature encoders to obtain textual and
visual embeddings for both mentions and entities; (iii)-(iv) the intra-level
mixture of experts and inter-level mixture of experts modules apply a switch
mixture of experts mechanism to dynamically and adaptively select features from
relevant regions of information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
outstanding performance of MMoE compared to the state-of-the-art. MMoE's code
is available at: https://github.com/zhiweihu1103/MEL-MMoE.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CoPT, a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation, leveraging domain-agnostic text embeddings to improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UDA for semantic segmentation lacks utilization of domain-agnostic text properties, despite advances in vision-language models. The paper aims to bridge this gap.

Method: Proposes CoPT, which uses LLM-generated domain descriptions and CLIP embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on four UDA segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: CoPT effectively leverages text embeddings for domain-invariant learning, advancing UDA for segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from
labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain.
UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where
annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite
recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA
methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic
properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based
Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn
domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings
are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to
generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP
model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model
trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for
segmentation. The code can be found at https://github.com/cfmata/CoPT.

*Renyang Liu,Guanlin Li,Tianwei Zhang,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Recall, an adversarial framework targeting the robustness of unlearned image generation models (IGMs), revealing vulnerabilities in current unlearning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ethical and societal concerns of IGMs by evaluating the robustness of machine unlearning (MU) methods against adversarial inputs.

Method: Proposes Recall, a framework optimizing adversarial image prompts using multi-modal conditioning in diffusion models, tested on ten unlearning methods.

Result: Recall outperforms baselines in adversarial effectiveness, efficiency, and semantic fidelity, exposing vulnerabilities in unlearning mechanisms.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust unlearning solutions to ensure the safety of generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly
diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly
enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However,
their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and
societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or
copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning
(MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable
concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness
of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in
the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework
explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike
existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall
exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion
models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a
single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten
state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall
consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial
effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the
original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in
current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions
to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models. Code and data are

Motivation: To promote transparency, trust, and clinical adoption of DL models in biomedical imaging by addressing overlooked aspects in existing XAI surveys.

Method: Systematic categorization and analysis of XAI methods, proposing a modality-centered taxonomy and examining multimodal and vision-language paradigms.

Result: A structured synthesis of XAI techniques, evaluation metrics, and open-source frameworks, highlighting challenges and future directions.

Conclusion: The survey lays a foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis, emphasizing modality-specific needs and emerging trends.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important
in biomedical image analysis to promote transparency, trust, and clinical
adoption of DL models. While several surveys have reviewed XAI techniques, they
often lack a modality-aware perspective, overlook recent advances in multimodal
and vision-language paradigms, and provide limited practical guidance. This
survey addresses this gap through a comprehensive and structured synthesis of
XAI methods tailored to biomedical image analysis.We systematically categorize
XAI methods, analyzing their underlying principles, strengths, and limitations
within biomedical contexts. A modality-centered taxonomy is proposed to align
XAI methods with specific imaging types, highlighting the distinct
interpretability challenges across modalities. We further examine the emerging
role of multimodal learning and vision-language models in explainable
biomedical AI, a topic largely underexplored in previous work. Our
contributions also include a summary of widely used evaluation metrics and
open-source frameworks, along with a critical discussion of persistent
challenges and future directions. This survey offers a timely and in-depth
foundation for advancing interpretable DL in biomedical image analysis.

*Zongmeng Zhang,Wengang Zhou,Jie Zhao,Houqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) due to modality conflict, introduces the MMMC dataset, and evaluates three methods to mitigate this issue, with reinforcement learning performing best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address hallucinations in MLLMs caused by inherent conflicts in multimodal inputs, a problem overlooked in prior research.

Method: Defines modality conflict, constructs the MMMC dataset, and tests prompt engineering, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to reduce hallucinations.

Result: Reinforcement learning outperforms other methods in mitigating hallucinations, while supervised fine-tuning shows stable performance.

Conclusion: Highlights the impact of modality conflict on MLLM hallucinations and offers insights into improving model robustness.

Abstract: Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in
real-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in
MLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing
on the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent
conflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and
directly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and
construct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this
phenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,
supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate
the hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are
conducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these
methods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the
best performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while
the supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our
work sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to
hallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.

*Antonella Barisic Kulas,Frano Petric,Stjepan Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method for autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in GNSS-denied environments using UAVs with YOLOv8, feature matching, and hue histogram analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous target vessel identification is critical for applications like search and rescue and threat detection, especially when GNSS is unavailable and visual cues are the only descriptors.

Method: The approach combines YOLOv8 for vessel detection, feature matching, and hue histogram distance analysis to identify targets, followed by geometric localization.

Result: The method was tested in real-world experiments during MBZIRC2023, showing effectiveness in GNSS-denied navigation. Perspective impacts detection accuracy and localization precision were evaluated.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses the challenge of target vessel identification in GNSS-denied environments, demonstrating practical viability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in
environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available
is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat
detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last
known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely
solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict
computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8
object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then
apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether
any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the
target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in
real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a
fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the
impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and
compare it with the oracle approach.

*Desheng Li,Chaoliang Liu,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CL-Polyp is a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp segmentation network that improves feature extraction and segmentation performance without extra labeled data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing polyp segmentation methods rely on additional labeled data or task similarity, limiting generalizability. CL-Polyp aims to overcome these challenges.

Method: Uses contrastive learning for discriminative feature extraction and introduces MASPP and CA modules for multi-scale feature fusion and boundary reconstruction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five datasets, improving IoU by 0.011 and 0.020 on Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB, respectively.

Conclusion: CL-Polyp is effective for clinical polyp segmentation, enhancing performance without requiring extra annotations.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of polyps from colonoscopy images is crucial for the
early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. Most existing deep
learning-based polyp segmentation methods adopt an Encoder-Decoder
architecture, and some utilize multi-task frameworks that incorporate auxiliary
tasks such as classification to enhance segmentation performance. However,
these approaches often require additional labeled data and rely on task
similarity, which can limit their generalizability. To address these
challenges, we propose CL-Polyp, a contrastive learning-enhanced polyp
segmentation network. Our method leverages contrastive learning to improve the
encoder's ability to extract discriminative features by contrasting positive
and negative sample pairs derived from polyp images. This self-supervised
strategy enhances visual representation without requiring additional
annotations. In addition, we introduce two lightweight and effective modules:
the Modified Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (MASPP) module for better
multi-scale feature fusion, and the Channel Concatenate and Element Add (CA)
module to fuse low-level and upsampled features for improved boundary
reconstruction. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets-Kvasir-SEG,
CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, CVC-300, and ETIS-demonstrate that CL-Polyp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, it improves
the IoU metric by 0.011 and 0.020 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets,
respectively, validating its effectiveness in clinical polyp segmentation
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel model aligns EEG signals with multilevel semantic captions for image reconstruction, bypassing direct EEG-to-image generation. It uses a transformer-based EEG encoder and a pretrained latent diffusion model, achieving state-of-the-art results on the EEGCVPR dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome EEG's spatial limitations for image reconstruction by leveraging semantic captions and aligning brain signals with interpretable neurocognitive pathways.

Method: Aligns EEG signals with semantic captions (object-level to abstract themes) using a transformer-based encoder and contrastive learning. A pretrained latent diffusion model generates images from caption embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art visual decoding on EEGCVPR, with interpretable alignment to neurocognitive pathways and semantic topography across the scalp.

Conclusion: Semantic mediation enables cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG, demonstrating the potential of structured semantic frameworks in neuroscience and AI.

Abstract: Decoding visual experience from brain signals offers exciting possibilities
for neuroscience and interpretable AI. While EEG is accessible and temporally
precise, its limitations in spatial detail hinder image reconstruction. Our
model bypasses direct EEG-to-image generation by aligning EEG signals with
multilevel semantic captions -- ranging from object-level to abstract themes --
generated by a large language model. A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain
activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference,
caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent
diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields
state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable
alignment to known neurocognitive pathways. Dominant EEG-caption associations
reflected the importance of different semantic levels extracted from perceived
images. Saliency maps and t-SNE projections reveal semantic topography across
the scalp. Our model demonstrates how structured semantic mediation enables
cognitively aligned visual decoding from EEG.

TL;DR: The paper reviews video generative models, highlighting limitations in producing long-form videos with consistent characters and scenes, and proposes a taxonomy of methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models struggle with long-form videos (beyond 16 seconds), particularly in maintaining character consistency, scene layouts, and motion coherence. Multi-subject videos face even greater challenges.

Method: The authors analyzed 32 papers on video generation to identify key architectural components and training strategies. They also developed a taxonomy and comparative tables categorizing methods by design and performance.

Result: The study identifies gaps in current methods, such as frame redundancy and low temporal diversity, and provides a structured overview of existing approaches.

Conclusion: The paper offers a comprehensive taxonomy and analysis of video generation methods, aiming to guide future research in improving long-form video quality and consistency.

Abstract: Despite the significant progress that has been made in video generative
models, existing state-of-the-art methods can only produce videos lasting 5-16
seconds, often labeled "long-form videos". Furthermore, videos exceeding 16
seconds struggle to maintain consistent character appearances and scene layouts
throughout the narrative. In particular, multi-subject long videos still fail
to preserve character consistency and motion coherence. While some methods can
generate videos up to 150 seconds long, they often suffer from frame redundancy
and low temporal diversity. Recent work has attempted to produce long-form
videos featuring multiple characters, narrative coherence, and high-fidelity
detail. We comprehensively studied 32 papers on video generation to identify
key architectural components and training strategies that consistently yield
these qualities. We also construct a comprehensive novel taxonomy of existing
methods and present comparative tables that categorize papers by their
architectural designs and performance characteristics.

*Priyank Pathak,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes CSCI, an RGB-only method for Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID), using color to mitigate appearance bias without extra models or annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CC-ReID methods are resource-intensive due to reliance on additional models or annotations. The paper explores color as a lightweight, annotation-free solution.

Method: Introduces CSCI, leveraging foreground and background colors to disentangle appearance bias from identity features, using S2A self-attention to prevent information leak.

Result: Improves baseline by 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for image ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video ReID without extra supervision.

Conclusion: Color is a cost-effective proxy for addressing appearance bias in CC-ReID, validated by strong performance on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Clothes-Changing Re-Identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals
across different locations and times, irrespective of clothing. Existing
methods often rely on additional models or annotations to learn robust,
clothing-invariant features, making them resource-intensive. In contrast, we
explore the use of color - specifically foreground and background colors - as a
lightweight, annotation-free proxy for mitigating appearance bias in ReID
models. We propose Colors See, Colors Ignore (CSCI), an RGB-only method that
leverages color information directly from raw images or video frames. CSCI
efficiently captures color-related appearance bias ('Color See') while
disentangling it from identity-relevant ReID features ('Color Ignore'). To
achieve this, we introduce S2A self-attention, a novel self-attention to
prevent information leak between color and identity cues within the feature
space. Our analysis shows a strong correspondence between learned color
embeddings and clothing attributes, validating color as an effective proxy when
explicit clothing labels are unavailable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSCI on both image and video ReID with extensive experiments on four CC-ReID
datasets. We improve the baseline by Top-1 2.9% on LTCC and 5.0% on PRCC for
image-based ReID, and 1.0% on CCVID and 2.5% on MeVID for video-based ReID
without relying on additional supervision. Our results highlight the potential
of color as a cost-effective solution for addressing appearance bias in
CC-ReID. Github: https://github.com/ppriyank/ICCV-CSCI-Person-ReID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework called DisenQ is proposed to disentangle biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features using structured language guidance, achieving state-of-the-art performance on activity-based video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional person identification struggles with identity cues entangled in motion and appearance variations, making biometrics feature learning complex.

Method: A multimodal language-guided framework (DisenQ) replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual supervision to disentangle features.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on three activity-based video benchmarks and strong generalization to traditional video-based identification.

Conclusion: The framework effectively disentangles identity cues from motion and appearance variations, preventing misidentifications and generalizing well.

Abstract: In this work, we address activity-biometrics, which involves identifying
individuals across diverse set of activities. Unlike traditional person
identification, this setting introduces additional challenges as identity cues
become entangled with motion dynamics and appearance variations, making
biometrics feature learning more complex. While additional visual data like
pose and/or silhouette help, they often struggle from extraction inaccuracies.
To overcome this, we propose a multimodal language-guided framework that
replaces reliance on additional visual data with structured textual
supervision. At its core, we introduce \textbf{DisenQ} (\textbf{Disen}tangling
\textbf{Q}-Former), a unified querying transformer that disentangles
biometrics, motion, and non-biometrics features by leveraging structured
language guidance. This ensures identity cues remain independent of appearance
and motion variations, preventing misidentifications. We evaluate our approach
on three activity-based video benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. Additionally, we demonstrate strong generalization to complex
real-world scenario with competitive performance on a traditional video-based
identification benchmark, showing the effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: LinguaMark is a benchmark for evaluating multilingual capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 11 languages and five social attributes. Closed-source models like GPT-4o and Gemini2.5 perform best, while open-source models like Qwen2.5 show strong multilingual generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs lack linguistic coverage, leading to biased outputs. Prior work neglects multilingual evaluation, prompting the need for LinguaMark.

Method: LinguaMark evaluates LMMs on a multilingual VQA task using 6,875 image-text pairs across 11 languages and five social attributes. Metrics include Bias, Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness.

Result: Closed-source models (GPT-4o, Gemini2.5) perform best overall. Open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) are competitive, with Qwen2.5 excelling in multilingual generalization.

Conclusion: LinguaMark highlights the need for multilingual evaluation in LMMs. Open-source models show promise, but closed-source models lead. The benchmark is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are typically trained on vast corpora of
image-text data but are often limited in linguistic coverage, leading to biased
and unfair outputs across languages. While prior work has explored multimodal
evaluation, less emphasis has been placed on assessing multilingual
capabilities. In this work, we introduce LinguaMark, a benchmark designed to
evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on a multilingual Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. Our dataset comprises 6,875 image-text pairs spanning 11 languages
and five social attributes. We evaluate models using three key metrics: Bias,
Answer Relevancy, and Faithfulness. Our findings reveal that closed-source
models generally achieve the highest overall performance. Both closed-source
(GPT-4o and Gemini2.5) and open-source models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5) perform
competitively across social attributes, and Qwen2.5 demonstrates strong
generalization across multiple languages. We release our benchmark and
evaluation code to encourage reproducibility and further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if vision-language models genuinely perform visual reasoning or rely on biases, MagiC provides a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Method: MagiC includes 5,500 weakly supervised and 900 human-curated QA examples, evaluating 15 models across four dimensions: correctness, reasoning, grounding, and self-correction.

Result: The benchmark introduces new metrics (MagiScore, StepSense) and reveals limitations in current visual reasoning approaches.

Conclusion: MagiC highlights gaps in grounded reasoning and offers insights for improving vision-language models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models have led to impressive
performance in visual question answering and multimodal reasoning. However, it
remains unclear whether these models genuinely perform grounded visual
reasoning or rely on superficial patterns and dataset biases. In this work, we
introduce MagiC, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate grounded
multimodal cognition, assessing not only answer accuracy but also the quality
of step-by-step reasoning and its alignment with relevant visual evidence. Our
benchmark includes approximately 5,500 weakly supervised QA examples generated
from strong model outputs and 900 human-curated examples with fine-grained
annotations, including answers, rationales, and bounding box groundings. We
evaluate 15 vision-language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters across
four dimensions: final answer correctness, reasoning validity, grounding
fidelity, and self-correction ability. MagiC further includes diagnostic
settings to probe model robustness under adversarial visual cues and assess
their capacity for introspective error correction. We introduce new metrics
such as MagiScore and StepSense, and provide comprehensive analyses that reveal
key limitations and opportunities in current approaches to grounded visual
reasoning.

*Sherry X. Chen,Yi Wei,Luowei Zhou,Suren Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADIEE introduces an automated dataset creation approach to train a scoring model for instruction-guided image editing evaluation, outperforming existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of effective automated evaluation for instruction-guided image editing, especially with open-source VLMs' alignment issues and proprietary models' transparency and cost inefficiencies.

Method: Generate a large-scale dataset (100K+ samples) to fine-tune a modified LLaVA-NeXT-8B model, decoding numeric scores from a custom token.

Result: The scorer outperforms open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5, improving score correlation with human ratings by 17.24% and pair-wise comparison accuracy by up to 9.35%.

Conclusion: ADIEE's scorer is effective for automated evaluation, enhancing model performance and enabling applications like best edit selection and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in instruction-guided image editing underscore the need for
effective automated evaluation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
explored as judges, open-source models struggle with alignment, and proprietary
models lack transparency and cost efficiency. Additionally, no public training
datasets exist to fine-tune open-source VLMs, only small benchmarks with
diverse evaluation schemes. To address this, we introduce ADIEE, an automated
dataset creation approach which is then used to train a scoring model for
instruction-guided image editing evaluation. We generate a large-scale dataset
with over 100K samples and use it to fine-tune a LLaVA-NeXT-8B model modified
to decode a numeric score from a custom token. The resulting scorer outperforms
all open-source VLMs and Gemini-Pro 1.5 across all benchmarks, achieving a
0.0696 (+17.24%) gain in score correlation with human ratings on AURORA-Bench,
and improving pair-wise comparison accuracy by 4.03% (+7.21%) on GenAI-Bench
and 4.75% (+9.35%) on AURORA-Bench, respectively, compared to the
state-of-the-art. The scorer can act as a reward model, enabling automated best
edit selection and model fine-tuning. Notably, the proposed scorer can boost
MagicBrush model's average evaluation score on ImagenHub from 5.90 to 6.43
(+8.98%).

Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurate and scalable foundation-skin tone color blending in VTO applications.

Method: Proposes a method approximating Kubelka-Munk theory for faster image synthesis and builds a scalable end-to-end framework using e-commerce product data.

Result: Outperforms other techniques, validated with real-world makeup images.

Conclusion: The framework enhances realism and scalability in foundation makeup VTO.

Abstract: Augmented reality is revolutionizing beauty industry with virtual try-on
(VTO) applications, which empowers users to try a wide variety of products

*Daniel A. P. Oliveira,David Martins de Matos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a contrastive reinforcement learning approach to improve entity identity consistency in visual storytelling, showing significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual storytelling models often fail to maintain consistent character and object identities across frames, leading to incoherent references.

Method: Proposes a contrastive reinforcement learning framework with synthetic negative examples and a dual-component reward function, fine-tuning Qwen Storyteller.

Result: Improvements include grounding mAP (14.8%), F1 (17.1%), pronoun grounding accuracy, and cross-frame persistence (13.7%). Well-structured stories increased by 23.3%.

Conclusion: The contrastive framework effectively enhances entity identity consistency and storytelling coherence.

Abstract: Visual storytelling systems, particularly large vision-language models,
struggle to maintain character and object identity across frames,
  often failing to recognize when entities in different images represent the
same individuals or objects,
  leading to inconsistent references and referential hallucinations.
  This occurs because models lack explicit training on when to establish entity
connections across frames.
  We propose a contrastive reinforcement learning approach that trains models
to discriminate between coherent image sequences
  and stories from unrelated images.
  We extend the Story Reasoning dataset with synthetic negative examples to
teach appropriate entity connection behavior.
  We employ Direct Preference Optimization with a dual-component reward
function that promotes grounding and re-identification of entities
  in real stories while penalizing incorrect entity connections in synthetic
contexts.
  Using this contrastive framework, we fine-tune Qwen Storyteller (based on
Qwen2.5-VL 7B).
  Evaluation shows improvements in grounding mAP from 0.27 to 0.31 (+14.8%), F1
from 0.35 to 0.41 (+17.1%).
  Pronoun grounding accuracy improved across all pronoun types except ``its'',
  and cross-frame character and object persistence increased
  across all frame counts, with entities appearing in 5 or more frames
advancing from 29.3% to 33.3% (+13.7%).
  Well-structured stories, containing the chain-of-thought and grounded story,
increased from 79.1% to 97.5% (+23.3%).

*Haotian Wang,Aoran Xiao,Xiaoqin Zhang,Meng Yang,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PacGDC is a label-efficient technique for generalizable depth completion, using pseudo geometries and scale manipulation to reduce annotation effort while enhancing data diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training generalizable depth completion models requires large-scale labeled datasets, which are costly to collect. PacGDC aims to minimize annotation effort while improving data diversity.

Method: PacGDC synthesizes pseudo geometries by manipulating scene scales of depth maps using multiple depth foundation models. It incorporates interpolation, relocation, and unlabeled images for further diversity.

Result: PacGDC achieves strong generalizability across benchmarks, performing well in diverse scenes and depth conditions under zero-shot and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: PacGDC offers a scalable and efficient solution for depth completion, reducing reliance on labeled data while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: Generalizable depth completion enables the acquisition of dense metric depth
maps for unseen environments, offering robust perception capabilities for
various downstream tasks. However, training such models typically requires
large-scale datasets with metric depth labels, which are often labor-intensive
to collect. This paper presents PacGDC, a label-efficient technique that
enhances data diversity with minimal annotation effort for generalizable depth
completion. PacGDC builds on novel insights into inherent ambiguities and
consistencies in object shapes and positions during 2D-to-3D projection,
allowing the synthesis of numerous pseudo geometries for the same visual scene.
This process greatly broadens available geometries by manipulating scene scales
of the corresponding depth maps. To leverage this property, we propose a new
data synthesis pipeline that uses multiple depth foundation models as scale
manipulators. These models robustly provide pseudo depth labels with varied
scene scales, affecting both local objects and global layouts, while ensuring
projection consistency that supports generalization. To further diversify
geometries, we incorporate interpolation and relocation strategies, as well as
unlabeled images, extending the data coverage beyond the individual use of
foundation models. Extensive experiments show that PacGDC achieves remarkable
generalizability across multiple benchmarks, excelling in diverse scene
semantics/scales and depth sparsity/patterns under both zero-shot and few-shot
settings. Code: https://github.com/Wang-xjtu/PacGDC.

*Hong Xu,Shireen Y. Elhabian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces adaptive mechanisms for particle-based shape modeling to improve representation of anatomical variability by adjusting particle configurations to local geometric features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack self-adaptivity in particle configurations, limiting accurate representation of complex anatomical variability.

Method: Two mechanisms are proposed: (1) a neighborhood correspondence loss for high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm for regularization.

Result: The approach is evaluated on challenging datasets, showing improved adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and benchmarking against existing methods.

Conclusion: The introduced mechanisms enhance surface adaptivity while maintaining consistent particle configurations, improving anatomical shape modeling.

Abstract: Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) is a family of approaches that
automatically quantifies shape variability across anatomical cohorts by
positioning particles (pseudo landmarks) on shape surfaces in a consistent
configuration. Recent advances incorporate implicit radial basis function
representations as self-supervised signals to better capture the complex
geometric properties of anatomical structures. However, these methods still
lack self-adaptivity -- that is, the ability to automatically adjust particle
configurations to local geometric features of each surface, which is essential
for accurately representing complex anatomical variability. This paper
introduces two mechanisms to increase surface adaptivity while maintaining
consistent particle configurations: (1) a novel neighborhood correspondence
loss to enable high adaptivity and (2) a geodesic correspondence algorithm that
regularizes optimization to enforce geodesic neighborhood consistency. We
evaluate the efficacy and scalability of our approach on challenging datasets,
providing a detailed analysis of the adaptivity-correspondence trade-off and
benchmarking against existing methods on surface representation accuracy and
correspondence metrics.

TL;DR: The paper introduces MSAGSM, a lightweight module enhancing GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and spatial attention, improving event spotting in sports videos. It also presents the TTA dataset for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PES models lack sufficient temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability, limiting their performance in fine-grained action recognition.

Method: Proposes MSAGSM, integrating multi-scale temporal dilations and multi-head spatial attention into GSM for better temporal and spatial modeling.

Result: MSAGSM consistently improves performance across benchmarks with minimal overhead, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: MSAGSM is an effective, plug-and-play solution for PES, and the TTA dataset advances the field for table tennis event spotting.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level
recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES
models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as Gate Shift
Module (GSM) or Gate Shift Fuse (GSF) to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with
temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive
field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift
Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal dilations and
multi-head spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short- and
long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a
lightweight plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated with various 2D
backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis
Australia (TTA) dataset-the first PES benchmark for table tennis-containing
over 4800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across five PES
benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with
minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for cross-category animal motion transfer that preserves species-specific habits, leveraging a habit-preservation module and LLM for unobserved species.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on human motion and neglect animal habitual behaviors, creating a gap in animation and VR applications.

Method: Proposes a generative framework with a habit-preservation module and LLM integration for motion transfer to unobserved species.

Result: Validated on the DeformingThings4D-skl dataset, showing superior performance in preserving habitual behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework effectively bridges the gap in animal motion transfer, preserving species-specific habits and extending to new species.

Abstract: Animal motion embodies species-specific behavioral habits, making the
transfer of motion across categories a critical yet complex task for
applications in animation and virtual reality. Existing motion transfer
methods, primarily focused on human motion, emphasize skeletal alignment
(motion retargeting) or stylistic consistency (motion style transfer), often
neglecting the preservation of distinct habitual behaviors in animals. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel habit-preserved motion transfer framework
for cross-category animal motion. Built upon a generative framework, our model
introduces a habit-preservation module with category-specific habit encoder,
allowing it to learn motion priors that capture distinctive habitual
characteristics. Furthermore, we integrate a large language model (LLM) to
facilitate the motion transfer to previously unobserved species. To evaluate
the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce the DeformingThings4D-skl
dataset, a quadruped dataset with skeletal bindings, and conduct extensive
experiments and quantitative analyses, which validate the superiority of our
proposed model.

*Yongtang Bao,Chengjie Tang,Yuze Wang,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seg-Wild is an interactive segmentation method for unconstrained photo collections, addressing transient occlusions and lighting inconsistencies using 3D Gaussian Splatting and feature embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unconstrained photo collections are easier to obtain but suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient occlusions, making segmentation difficult. Existing methods fail to handle these challenges.

Method: Seg-Wild integrates multi-dimensional feature embeddings with 3D Gaussian Splatting for interactive segmentation. It uses the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to smooth anomalies and projects 3D Gaussians onto 2D planes for evaluation.

Result: Seg-Wild outperforms previous methods in segmentation and reconstruction quality for in-the-wild scenes.

Conclusion: Seg-Wild effectively addresses segmentation challenges in unconstrained photo collections, offering improved results and a benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Reconstructing and segmenting scenes from unconstrained photo collections
obtained from the Internet is a novel but challenging task. Unconstrained photo
collections are easier to get than well-captured photo collections. These
unconstrained images suffer from inconsistent lighting and transient
occlusions, which makes segmentation challenging. Previous segmentation methods
cannot address transient occlusions or accurately restore the scene's lighting
conditions. Therefore, we propose Seg-Wild, an interactive segmentation method
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting for unconstrained image collections, suitable
for in-the-wild scenes. We integrate multi-dimensional feature embeddings for
each 3D Gaussian and calculate the feature similarity between the feature
embeddings and the segmentation target to achieve interactive segmentation in
the 3D scene. Additionally, we introduce the Spiky 3D Gaussian Cutter (SGC) to
smooth abnormal 3D Gaussians. We project the 3D Gaussians onto a 2D plane and
calculate the ratio of 3D Gaussians that need to be cut using the SAM mask. We
also designed a benchmark to evaluate segmentation quality in in-the-wild
scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to previous methods,
Seg-Wild achieves better segmentation results and reconstruction quality. Our
code will be available at https://github.com/Sugar0725/Seg-Wild.

TL;DR: EscherNet++ is a masked fine-tuned diffusion model for zero-shot novel view synthesis and amodal completion, outperforming existing methods with simpler pipelines and better cross-view dependency handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis and amodal completion are multi-stage and inefficient, lacking cross-view dependency consideration. EscherNet++ aims to simplify this with an end-to-end approach.

Method: Uses masked fine-tuning (input-level and feature-level masking) to enable end-to-end novel view synthesis and amodal completion. Integrates with feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results: PSNR improved by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks. Reconstruction time reduced by 95%.

Conclusion: EscherNet++ offers a scalable, efficient solution for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, even with limited training data.

Abstract: We propose EscherNet++, a masked fine-tuned diffusion model that can
synthesize novel views of objects in a zero-shot manner with amodal completion
ability. Existing approaches utilize multiple stages and complex pipelines to
first hallucinate missing parts of the image and then perform novel view
synthesis, which fail to consider cross-view dependencies and require redundant
storage and computing for separate stages. Instead, we apply masked fine-tuning
including input-level and feature-level masking to enable an end-to-end model
with the improved ability to synthesize novel views and conduct amodal
completion. In addition, we empirically integrate our model with other
feed-forward image-to-mesh models without extra training and achieve
competitive results with reconstruction time decreased by 95%, thanks to its
ability to synthesize arbitrary query views. Our method's scalable nature
further enhances fast 3D reconstruction. Despite fine-tuning on a smaller
dataset and batch size, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, improving
PSNR by 3.9 and Volume IoU by 0.28 on occluded tasks in 10-input settings,
while also generalizing to real-world occluded reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces EPIC, a prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy for efficient text-image classification, reducing computational costs and trainable parameters while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) are computationally expensive to fine-tune, prompting the need for efficient interaction strategies.

Method: EPIC uses temporal prompts on intermediate layers and similarity-based prompt interaction to align modalities efficiently.

Result: EPIC reduces computational costs (1% of foundation model parameters) and outperforms others on UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE, matching MM-IMDB performance.

Conclusion: EPIC offers an efficient, resource-saving solution for multimodal tasks without compromising performance.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained multimodal models (LMMs) generally
emerge to integrate the vision and language modalities, achieving considerable
success in multimodal tasks, such as text-image classification. The growing
size of LMMs, however, results in a significant computational cost for
fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. Hence, prompt-based interaction
strategy is studied to align modalities more efficiently. In this context, we
propose a novel efficient prompt-based multimodal interaction strategy, namely
Efficient Prompt Interaction for text-image Classification (EPIC).
Specifically, we utilize temporal prompts on intermediate layers, and integrate
different modalities with similarity-based prompt interaction, to leverage
sufficient information exchange between modalities. Utilizing this approach,
our method achieves reduced computational resource consumption and fewer
trainable parameters (about 1\% of the foundation model) compared to other
fine-tuning strategies. Furthermore, it demonstrates superior performance on
the UPMC-Food101 and SNLI-VE datasets, while achieving comparable performance
on the MM-IMDB dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack strong reasoning for complex tasks, prompting the development of Corvid.

Method: Corvid uses a hybrid vision encoder, GateMixer, and a two-stage CoT training approach with MCoT-Instruct-287K. Inference-time scaling with self-verification improves reasoning.

Result: Corvid surpasses similar MLLMs in mathematical and science reasoning.

Conclusion: Corvid advances MLLM reasoning capabilities, offering a robust solution for complex tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated exceptional performance in multimodal perception and
understanding. However, leading open-source MLLMs exhibit significant
limitations in complex and structured reasoning, particularly in tasks
requiring deep reasoning for decision-making and problem-solving. In this work,
we present Corvid, an MLLM with enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
capabilities. Architecturally, Corvid incorporates a hybrid vision encoder for
informative visual representation and a meticulously designed connector
(GateMixer) to facilitate cross-modal alignment. To enhance Corvid's CoT
reasoning capabilities, we introduce MCoT-Instruct-287K, a high-quality
multimodal CoT instruction-following dataset, refined and standardized from
diverse public reasoning sources. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune Corvid
with a two-stage CoT-formatted training approach to progressively enhance its
step-by-step reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we propose an effective
inference-time scaling strategy that enables Corvid to mitigate over-reasoning
and under-reasoning through self-verification. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Corvid outperforms existing o1-like MLLMs and state-of-the-art
MLLMs with similar parameter scales, with notable strengths in mathematical
reasoning and science problem-solving. Project page:

Conclusion: High-resolution data and effective feature aggregation are crucial for advancing practical 3D anomaly detection, as demonstrated by MiniShift and Simple3D.

Abstract: In industrial point cloud analysis, detecting subtle anomalies demands
high-resolution spatial data, yet prevailing benchmarks emphasize
low-resolution inputs. To address this disparity, we propose a scalable

intricate geometric details with minimal computational overhead, achieving
real-time inference exceeding 20 fps. Extensive evaluations on MiniShift and
established benchmarks demonstrate that Simple3D surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in both accuracy and speed, highlighting the pivotal role of
high-resolution data and effective feature aggregation in advancing practical

Method: Proposes DSANet with AFSA (channel-wise similarity for adjacent frames) and LGSA (fusion of local and global features) modules to mitigate noise and improve segmentation.

Result: DSANet outperforms existing methods in accuracy on four datasets and achieves higher inference FPS by avoiding pixel-level dependencies.

Conclusion: DSANet effectively enhances noise robustness in ultrasound segmentation, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to current approaches.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a prevalent diagnostic tool known for its simplicity
and non-invasiveness. However, its inherent characteristics often introduce
substantial noise, posing considerable challenges for automated lesion or organ
segmentation in ultrasound video sequences. To address these limitations, we
propose the Dual Semantic-Aware Network (DSANet), a novel framework designed to
enhance noise robustness in ultrasound video segmentation by fostering mutual
semantic awareness between local and global features. Specifically, we
introduce an Adjacent-Frame Semantic-Aware (AFSA) module, which constructs a
channel-wise similarity matrix to guide feature fusion across adjacent frames,
effectively mitigating the impact of random noise without relying on
pixel-level relationships. Additionally, we propose a Local-and-Global
Semantic-Aware (LGSA) module that reorganizes and fuses temporal unconditional
local features, which capture spatial details independently at each frame, with
conditional global features that incorporate temporal context from adjacent
frames. This integration facilitates multi-level semantic representation,
significantly improving the model's resilience to noise interference. Extensive
evaluations on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSANet substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy. Moreover, since
our model avoids pixel-level feature dependencies, it achieves significantly
higher inference FPS than video-based methods, and even surpasses some
image-based models. Code can be found in

*M. A. Rasel,Sameem Abdul Kareem,Zhenli Kwan,Shin Shen Yong,Unaizah Obaidellah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is proposed for detecting the blue-white veil (BWV) in skin lesions, achieving high accuracy across datasets and using explainable AI for interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Melanoma is deadly, and BWV is a key diagnostic feature, but research on automated BWV detection is limited.

Method: A DCNN is trained on annotated datasets created via color threshold techniques, with custom layers for BWV classification.

Result: The model achieves 85.71%-95.05% accuracy across datasets and outperforms existing BWV detection models.

Conclusion: The approach improves BWV detection, aiding early melanoma diagnosis, and is enhanced by explainable AI.

Abstract: Melanoma, one of the deadliest types of skin cancer, accounts for thousands
of fatalities globally. The bluish, blue-whitish, or blue-white veil (BWV) is a
critical feature for diagnosing melanoma, yet research into detecting BWV in
dermatological images is limited. This study utilizes a non-annotated skin
lesion dataset, which is converted into an annotated dataset using a proposed
imaging algorithm based on color threshold techniques on lesion patches and
color palettes. A Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) is designed and
trained separately on three individual and combined dermoscopic datasets, using
custom layers instead of standard activation function layers. The model is
developed to categorize skin lesions based on the presence of BWV. The proposed
DCNN demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional BWV detection
models across different datasets. The model achieves a testing accuracy of
85.71% on the augmented PH2 dataset, 95.00% on the augmented ISIC archive
dataset, 95.05% on the combined augmented (PH2+ISIC archive) dataset, and
90.00% on the Derm7pt dataset. An explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
algorithm is subsequently applied to interpret the DCNN's decision-making
process regarding BWV detection. The proposed approach, coupled with XAI,
significantly improves the detection of BWV in skin lesions, outperforming
existing models and providing a robust tool for early melanoma diagnosis.

*Jeonghoon Song,Sunghun Kim,Jaegyun Im,Byeongjoon Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Objectomaly improves OoD segmentation by refining anomaly scores and boundaries using object-level priors, achieving top performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mask-based OoD segmentation methods struggle with boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores, and false positives from background noise.

Method: Objectomaly uses a three-stage framework: Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS), Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC), and Meticulous Boundary Precision (MBP).

Result: State-of-the-art performance on benchmarks (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR95 down to 0.07, F1-score up to 83.44).

Conclusion: Objectomaly is robust and generalizable, validated by ablation studies and real-world driving videos.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OoD) segmentation is critical for safety-sensitive
applications like autonomous driving. However, existing mask-based methods
often suffer from boundary imprecision, inconsistent anomaly scores within
objects, and false positives from background noise. We propose
\textbf{\textit{Objectomaly}}, an objectness-aware refinement framework that
incorporates object-level priors. Objectomaly consists of three stages: (1)
Coarse Anomaly Scoring (CAS) using an existing OoD backbone, (2)
Objectness-Aware Score Calibration (OASC) leveraging SAM-generated instance
masks for object-level score normalization, and (3) Meticulous Boundary
Precision (MBP) applying Laplacian filtering and Gaussian smoothing for contour
refinement. Objectomaly achieves state-of-the-art performance on key OoD
segmentation benchmarks, including SMIYC AnomalyTrack/ObstacleTrack and
RoadAnomaly, improving both pixel-level (AuPRC up to 96.99, FPR$_{95}$ down to
0.07) and component-level (F1$-$score up to 83.44) metrics. Ablation studies
and qualitative results on real-world driving videos further validate the
robustness and generalizability of our method. Code will be released upon
publication.

### [81] [Degradation-Agnostic Statistical Facial Feature Transformation for Blind Face Restoration in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07464)
*Chang-Hwan Son*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel GAN-based blind face image restoration (FIR) framework is proposed to address weather-induced degradations, integrating local Statistical Facial Feature Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). It outperforms existing methods in restoring facial structures and textures under adverse weather.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adverse weather degrades image quality, reducing face recognition accuracy. Current FIR models lack dedicated modules for weather-induced degradations, leading to distorted facial features.

Method: The framework combines local SFFT for enhancing facial structure and color fidelity by aligning statistical distributions, and DAFE for robust feature extraction under adverse weather.

Result: The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art GAN and diffusion-based FIR methods, especially in suppressing texture distortions and reconstructing facial structures accurately.

Conclusion: The SFFT and DAFE modules effectively enhance structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face restoration under challenging weather conditions.

Abstract: With the increasing deployment of intelligent CCTV systems in outdoor
environments, there is a growing demand for face recognition systems optimized
for challenging weather conditions. Adverse weather significantly degrades
image quality, which in turn reduces recognition accuracy. Although recent face
image restoration (FIR) models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs)
and diffusion models have shown progress, their performance remains limited due
to the lack of dedicated modules that explicitly address weather-induced
degradations. This leads to distorted facial textures and structures. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel GAN-based blind FIR framework
that integrates two key components: local Statistical Facial Feature
Transformation (SFFT) and Degradation-Agnostic Feature Embedding (DAFE). The
local SFFT module enhances facial structure and color fidelity by aligning the
local statistical distributions of low-quality (LQ) facial regions with those
of high-quality (HQ) counterparts. Complementarily, the DAFE module enables
robust statistical facial feature extraction under adverse weather conditions
by aligning LQ and HQ encoder representations, thereby making the restoration
process adaptive to severe weather-induced degradations. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed degradation-agnostic SFFT model outperforms
existing state-of-the-art FIR methods based on GAN and diffusion models,
particularly in suppressing texture distortions and accurately reconstructing
facial structures. Furthermore, both the SFFT and DAFE modules are empirically
validated in enhancing structural fidelity and perceptual quality in face
restoration under challenging weather scenarios.

### [82] [Temporal Unlearnable Examples: Preventing Personal Video Data from Unauthorized Exploitation by Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07483)
*Qiangqiang Wu,Yi Yu,Chenqi Kong,Ziquan Liu,Jia Wan,Haoliang Li,Alex C. Kot,Antoni B. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a generative framework for Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs) to protect video data-privacy from unauthorized use in Visual Object Tracking (VOT), addressing inefficiencies and limitations of existing image-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The VOT community has neglected video data-privacy, with private videos often used without consent for training commercial models. Current methods for preventing unauthorized data use are image-focused and ineffective for videos.

Method: The authors propose a novel generative framework for TUEs, incorporating a temporal contrastive loss to corrupt tracker learning. This ensures trackers rely on unlearnable noise, ignoring original data.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed TUE framework effectively safeguards video data-privacy against unauthorized exploitation in VOT, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g.,
YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT).
However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as
many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models
without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first
investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation
by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use
primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly
applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency,
limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we
propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable
Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on
large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on
unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure
and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of
TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the
learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT
models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Online Map Association (OMA), a benchmark for associating global SD maps with online HD maps to improve autonomous vehicle navigation. It includes a dataset and a baseline method, Map Association Transformer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle with integrating global SD maps and online HD maps for hybrid navigation, limiting their real-world usability.

Method: Proposes the OMA benchmark with 480k roads and 260k lane paths, and introduces Map Association Transformer, using path-aware and spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: OMA enhances planning capabilities by enabling geometric and topological understanding between maps.

Conclusion: The work addresses a critical gap in autonomous navigation by providing a benchmark and baseline method for hybrid map association.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles rely on global standard-definition (SD) maps for
road-level route planning and online local high-definition (HD) maps for
lane-level navigation. However, recent work concentrates on construct online HD
maps, often overlooking the association of global SD maps with online HD maps
for hybrid navigation, making challenges in utilizing online HD maps in the
real world. Observing the lack of the capability of autonomous vehicles in
navigation, we introduce \textbf{O}nline \textbf{M}ap \textbf{A}ssociation, the
first benchmark for the association of hybrid navigation-oriented online maps,
which enhances the planning capabilities of autonomous vehicles. Based on
existing datasets, the OMA contains 480k of roads and 260k of lane paths and
provides the corresponding metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.
Additionally, we propose a novel framework, named Map Association Transformer,
as the baseline method, using path-aware attention and spatial attention
mechanisms to enable the understanding of geometric and topological
correspondences. The code and dataset can be accessed at

TL;DR: DMPO introduces a novel method for aligning diffusion models with human preferences by minimizing reverse KL divergence, outperforming existing techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve diffusion models by aligning them with human preferences, addressing suboptimal optimization in existing methods.

Method: Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), minimizing reverse KL divergence for alignment.

Result: DMPO outperforms existing baselines by at least 64.6% in PickScore across datasets.

Conclusion: DMPO provides a robust and principled approach for preference alignment in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and
versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of
language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the
models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment
from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference
optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference
Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion
models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the
same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to
justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to
validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic
metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO
can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically
outperforming all existing diffusion alignment baselines by at least 64.6% in
PickScore across all evaluation datasets, demonstrating the method's
superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO
unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging
principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

*Shuaijin Wan,Huaijiang Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GGMotion introduces a group graph dynamics-kinematics network to model human motion by leveraging physical priors, improving realism and performance in motion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods neglect physical dependencies between joints, leading to unrealistic motions and increased learning difficulty.

Method: GGMotion uses a radial field for spatio-temporal dependencies, inter/intra-group interaction modules, and equivariant MLPs for joint updates. An auxiliary loss supervises motion priors.

Result: Achieves superior performance on Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW benchmarks for short-term motion prediction.

Conclusion: GGMotion effectively models human motion with physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Human motion is a continuous physical process in 3D space, governed by
complex dynamic and kinematic constraints. Existing methods typically represent
the human pose as an abstract graph structure, neglecting the intrinsic
physical dependencies between joints, which increases learning difficulty and
makes the model prone to generating unrealistic motions. In this paper, we
propose GGMotion, a group graph dynamics-kinematics network that models human
topology in groups to better leverage dynamics and kinematics priors. To
preserve the geometric equivariance in 3D space, we propose a novel radial
field for the graph network that captures more comprehensive spatio-temporal
dependencies by aggregating joint features through spatial and temporal edges.
Inter-group and intra-group interaction modules are employed to capture the
dependencies of joints at different scales. Combined with equivariant
multilayer perceptrons (MLP), joint position features are updated in each group
through parallelized dynamics-kinematics propagation to improve physical
plausibility. Meanwhile, we introduce an auxiliary loss to supervise motion
priors during training. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks,
including Human3.6M, CMU-Mocap, and 3DPW, demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of our approach, achieving a significant performance margin in
short-term motion prediction. The code is available at

*Bangning Wei,Joshua Maraval,Meriem Outtas,Kidiyo Kpalma,Nicolas Ramin,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MUVOD, a multi-view video dataset for 4D object segmentation in dynamic scenes, addressing the lack of labeled data. It includes 17 scenes with 7830 RGB images and segmentation masks, covering 73 categories. A baseline method and evaluation metric are provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of extensive, accurately labeled multi-view video datasets hinders progress in 4D object segmentation for dynamic scenes. MUVOD aims to fill this gap.

Method: The dataset includes 17 scenes with 9-46 views each, totaling 7830 RGB images and segmentation masks. A baseline segmentation approach and evaluation metric are proposed.

Result: MUVOD provides 459 instances across 73 categories, enabling benchmarking for multi-view video segmentation. A subset is also proposed for 3D object segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: MUVOD serves as a foundational benchmark for 4D and 3D object segmentation, encouraging advancements in dynamic scene understanding.

Abstract: The application of methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) have steadily gained popularity in the field of 3D
object segmentation in static scenes. These approaches demonstrate efficacy in
a range of 3D scene understanding and editing tasks. Nevertheless, the 4D
object segmentation of dynamic scenes remains an underexplored field due to the
absence of a sufficiently extensive and accurately labelled multi-view video
dataset. In this paper, we present MUVOD, a new multi-view video dataset for
training and evaluating object segmentation in reconstructed real-world
scenarios. The 17 selected scenes, describing various indoor or outdoor
activities, are collected from different sources of datasets originating from
various types of camera rigs. Each scene contains a minimum of 9 views and a
maximum of 46 views. We provide 7830 RGB images (30 frames per video) with
their corresponding segmentation mask in 4D motion, meaning that any object of
interest in the scene could be tracked across temporal frames of a given view
or across different views belonging to the same camera rig. This dataset, which
contains 459 instances of 73 categories, is intended as a basic benchmark for
the evaluation of multi-view video segmentation methods. We also present an
evaluation metric and a baseline segmentation approach to encourage and
evaluate progress in this evolving field. Additionally, we propose a new
benchmark for 3D object segmentation task with a subset of annotated multi-view
images selected from our MUVOD dataset. This subset contains 50 objects of
different conditions in different scenarios, providing a more comprehensive
analysis of state-of-the-art 3D object segmentation methods. Our proposed MUVOD
dataset is available at https://volumetric-repository.labs.b-com.com/#/muvod.

*Mingyang Song,Yang Zhang,Marko Mihajlovic,Siyu Tang,Markus Gross,Tunç Ozan Aydın*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spline-based trajectory representation is proposed to improve spatial coherence and temporal interpolation in dense point modeling, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for trajectory modeling either lack spatial coherence due to neural network biases or rely on heuristic-based techniques. The potential of implicit representations for sparse temporal signals is also under-explored.

Method: The paper introduces a spline-based trajectory representation with explicit knot degrees of freedom, enabling efficient velocity derivation. A low-rank time-variant spatial encoding is proposed to model knot characteristics.

Result: The method excels in temporal interpolation for sparse inputs and achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction while enhancing motion coherence.

Conclusion: The spline-based approach offers a superior alternative to existing techniques, improving spatial and temporal modeling without relying on heuristic constraints.

Abstract: Trajectory modeling of dense points usually employs implicit deformation
fields, represented as neural networks that map coordinates to relate canonical
spatial positions to temporal offsets. However, the inductive biases inherent
in neural networks can hinder spatial coherence in ill-posed scenarios. Current
methods focus either on enhancing encoding strategies for deformation fields,
often resulting in opaque and less intuitive models, or adopt explicit
techniques like linear blend skinning, which rely on heuristic-based node
initialization. Additionally, the potential of implicit representations for
interpolating sparse temporal signals remains under-explored. To address these
challenges, we propose a spline-based trajectory representation, where the
number of knots explicitly determines the degrees of freedom. This approach
enables efficient analytical derivation of velocities, preserving spatial
coherence and accelerations, while mitigating temporal fluctuations. To model
knot characteristics in both spatial and temporal domains, we introduce a novel
low-rank time-variant spatial encoding, replacing conventional coupled
spatiotemporal techniques. Our method demonstrates superior performance in
temporal interpolation for fitting continuous fields with sparse inputs.
Furthermore, it achieves competitive dynamic scene reconstruction quality
compared to state-of-the-art methods while enhancing motion coherence without
relying on linear blend skinning or as-rigid-as-possible constraints.

*Joelle Hanna,Linus Scheibenreif,Damian Borth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPEX is a remote sensing foundation model using mixture-of-modality experts to address modality mismatch and fine-tuning challenges. It employs modality-conditioned token routing and pruning for efficient task-specific adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models focus on specific modalities, causing mismatches with application needs and high fine-tuning costs for small datasets.

Method: MAPEX pre-trains on multi-modal data with modality-conditioned token routing and uses modality-aware pruning for task-specific adaptation.

Result: MAPEX outperforms fully supervised training and state-of-the-art foundation models on diverse remote sensing datasets.

Conclusion: MAPEX effectively bridges modality gaps and simplifies fine-tuning, offering a scalable solution for remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Remote sensing data is commonly used for tasks such as flood mapping,
wildfire detection, or land-use studies. For each task, scientists carefully
choose appropriate modalities or leverage data from purpose-built instruments.
Recent work on remote sensing foundation models pre-trains computer vision
models on large amounts of remote sensing data. These large-scale models tend
to focus on specific modalities, often optical RGB or multispectral data. For
many important applications, this introduces a mismatch between the application
modalities and the pre-training data. Moreover, the large size of foundation
models makes them expensive and difficult to fine-tune on typically small
datasets for each task. We address this mismatch with MAPEX, a remote sensing
foundation model based on mixture-of-modality experts. MAPEX is pre-trained on
multi-modal remote sensing data with a novel modality-conditioned token routing
mechanism that elicits modality-specific experts. To apply the model on a
specific task, we propose a modality aware pruning technique, which only
retains experts specialized for the task modalities. This yields efficient
modality-specific models while simplifying fine-tuning and deployment for the
modalities of interest. We experimentally validate MAPEX on diverse remote
sensing datasets and show strong performance compared to fully supervised
training and state-of-the-art remote sensing foundation models. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates the 'linear reasoning bottleneck' in Visual-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing the Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC). It reveals that the bottleneck stems from reasoning pathway failures, not poor perception, and proposes task-dependent interventions for alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and address the limitations of VLMs in abstract reasoning tasks, particularly the linear separability bottleneck, and explore solutions for better alignment.

Method: Introduces the LSC metric, uses postfix tuning as a control, and examines task-dependent interventions (activating pathways or adapting weights).

Result: Finds widespread bottlenecks due to reasoning pathway failures, identifies dormant reasoning pathways, and shows that deeper adaptation can degrade performance on new prompts.

Conclusion: Robust reasoning in VLMs requires targeted alignment, not just better representation learning, offering a new analytical lens for VLM performance.

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art Visual-Language Models (VLMs) are seemingly limited by
the linear separabilty of their visual embeddings on abstract reasoning tasks.
This work investigates this "linear reasoning bottleneck" by introducing the
Linear Separability Ceiling (LSC), the performance of a simple linear
classifier on a VLM's visual embeddings. We find this bottleneck is widespread
and stems not from poor perception, but from failures in the language model's
reasoning pathways. We demonstrate this is a solvable alignment issue. The
required intervention, however, is task-dependent: activating existing pathways
suffices for semantic concepts, while complex relational reasoning requires
adapting core model weights. Using postfix tuning as a methodological control,
we find strong evidence for powerful, dormant reasoning pathways within VLMs.
However, for complex relational tasks requiring deeper adaptation, explicitly
improving representation quality causes the model to fail on new prompt formats
despite its embeddings remaining well separated. Ultimately, this work provides
a new lens for VLM analysis, showing that robust reasoning is a matter of
targeted alignment, not simply improved representation learning.

*Chunyan Wang,Dong Zhang,Jinhui Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework (DGKD-WLSS) improves weakly-supervised semantic segmentation in low-light by combining diffusion-guided knowledge distillation and depth-guided feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail in low-light due to degraded image quality and weak supervision constraints, leading to unreliable class activation maps.

Method: DGKD-WLSS uses diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation for feature alignment, and depth maps for structural feature enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-light weakly-supervised semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: DGKD-WLSS effectively addresses low-light challenges, offering a robust solution for weakly-supervised tasks.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to assign category labels to
each pixel using weak annotations, significantly reducing manual annotation
costs. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable progress in well-lit
scenarios, their performance significantly degrades in low-light environments
due to two fundamental limitations: severe image quality degradation (e.g., low
contrast, noise, and color distortion) and the inherent constraints of weak
supervision. These factors collectively lead to unreliable class activation
maps and semantically ambiguous pseudo-labels, ultimately compromising the
model's ability to learn discriminative feature representations. To address
these problems, we propose Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation for
Weakly-Supervised Low-light Semantic Segmentation (DGKD-WLSS), a novel
framework that synergistically combines Diffusion-Guided Knowledge Distillation
(DGKD) with Depth-Guided Feature Fusion (DGF2). DGKD aligns normal-light and
low-light features via diffusion-based denoising and knowledge distillation,
while DGF2 integrates depth maps as illumination-invariant geometric priors to
enhance structural feature learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DGKD-WLSS, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in
weakly supervised semantic segmentation tasks under low-light conditions. The

Conclusion: HOTA enables accurate, large-scale 3D flood mapping for rapid disaster response.

Abstract: Floods are among the most frequent natural hazards and cause significant
social and economic damage. Timely, large-scale information on flood extent and
depth is essential for disaster response; however, existing products often
trade spatial detail for coverage or ignore flood depth altogether. To bridge
this gap, this work presents HOTA: Hierarchical Overlap-Tiling Aggregation, a
plug-and-play, multi-scale inference strategy. When combined with SegFormer and
a dual-constraint depth estimation module, this approach forms a complete 3D
flood-mapping pipeline. HOTA applies overlapping tiles of different sizes to
multispectral Sentinel-2 images only during inference, enabling the SegFormer
model to capture both local features and kilometre-scale inundation without
changing the network weights or retraining. The subsequent depth module is
based on a digital elevation model (DEM) differencing method, which refines the
2D mask and estimates flood depth by enforcing (i) zero depth along the flood
boundary and (ii) near-constant flood volume with respect to the DEM. A case
study on the March 2021 Kempsey (Australia) flood shows that HOTA, when coupled
with SegFormer, improves IoU from 73\% (U-Net baseline) to 84\%. The resulting
3D surface achieves a mean absolute boundary error of less than 0.5 m. These
results demonstrate that HOTA can produce accurate, large-area 3D flood maps
suitable for rapid disaster response.

*Kuiyuan Sun,Yuxuan Zhang,Jichao Zhang,Jiaming Liu,Wei Wang,Niculae Sebe,Yao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stable-Hair v2 is a diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer framework, the first to use multi-view diffusion models for high-fidelity, view-consistent hair transfer. It introduces a multi-view training pipeline and novel training strategy, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based methods lack consistency and quality in multi-view hair generation, limiting real-world applications like digital humans.

Method: Proposes a multi-view training pipeline with a Bald Converter, inpainting model, and face-finetuned diffusion model. Uses polar-azimuth embeddings and temporal attention for consistency.

Result: Achieves detailed, realistic hairstyle transfer with seamless multi-view consistency, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Stable-Hair v2 sets a new benchmark for multi-view hair transfer, demonstrating robust and high-fidelity results.

Abstract: While diffusion-based methods have shown impressive capabilities in capturing
diverse and complex hairstyles, their ability to generate consistent and
high-quality multi-view outputs -- crucial for real-world applications such as
digital humans and virtual avatars -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we
propose Stable-Hair v2, a novel diffusion-based multi-view hair transfer
framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage
multi-view diffusion models for robust, high-fidelity, and view-consistent hair
transfer across multiple perspectives. We introduce a comprehensive multi-view
training data generation pipeline comprising a diffusion-based Bald Converter,
a data-augment inpainting model, and a face-finetuned multi-view diffusion
model to generate high-quality triplet data, including bald images, reference
hairstyles, and view-aligned source-bald pairs. Our multi-view hair transfer
model integrates polar-azimuth embeddings for pose conditioning and temporal
attention layers to ensure smooth transitions between views. To optimize this
model, we design a novel multi-stage training strategy consisting of
pose-controllable latent IdentityNet training, hair extractor training, and
temporal attention training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
accurately transfers detailed and realistic hairstyles to source subjects while
achieving seamless and consistent results across views, significantly
outperforming existing methods and establishing a new benchmark in multi-view
hair transfer. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges like occlusions, background clutter, and target reappearance in video object tracking.

Method: Hierarchical motion estimation (linear prediction + non-linear refinement) and optimized memory bank (long-term/short-term distinction).

Result: 9.6% and 7.2% relative AUC improvements on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model; larger gains on smaller models.

Conclusion: The trainless, low-overhead enhancements effectively boost long-term tracking performance.

Abstract: This paper presents enhancements to the SAM2 framework for video object
tracking task, addressing challenges such as occlusions, background clutter,
and target reappearance. We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation
strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear
refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training.
In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and
short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term
occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent
improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model,
achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2,
and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the

TL;DR: LOSC improves open-vocabulary segmentation in lidar scans by refining noisy image-based labels and training a 3D network, outperforming SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the noise and sparsity in point labels from image-based VLMs for lidar scans in driving scenarios.

Method: Consolidate labels for spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to augmentations, then train a 3D network (LOSC).

Result: LOSC significantly outperforms SOTA in zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and panoptic segmentation on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: LOSC is a simple yet effective method for enhancing lidar scan segmentation using refined image-based labels.

Abstract: We study the use of image-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
open-vocabulary segmentation of lidar scans in driving settings. Classically,
image semantics can be back-projected onto 3D point clouds. Yet, resulting
point labels are noisy and sparse. We consolidate these labels to enforce both
spatio-temporal consistency and robustness to image-level augmentations. We
then train a 3D network based on these refined labels. This simple method,
called LOSC, outperforms the SOTA of zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic and
panoptic segmentation on both nuScenes and SemanticKITTI, with significant
margins.

*Siting Wang,Luoyang Sun,Cheng Deng,Kun Shao,Minnan Pei,Zheng Tian,Haifeng Zhang,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpatialViz-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating spatial visualization in MLLMs, revealing gaps in their performance despite advancements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for spatial visualization in MLLMs are embedded in broader tests, lack reliability, and may overlap with training data.

Method: Introduces SpatialViz-Bench, a multi-modal benchmark with 12 tasks across 4 sub-abilities, totaling 1,180 problems, to evaluate 33 MLLMs.

Result: Reveals performance variations, unexpected model behaviors (e.g., 2D-to-3D cliffs, misaligned difficulty perception), and reliance on formula derivation over visualization.

Conclusion: State-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle with spatial visualization, highlighting a critical gap. The benchmark is publicly available.

Abstract: Humans can directly imagine and manipulate visual images in their minds, a
capability known as spatial visualization. While multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) support imagination-based reasoning, spatial visualization
remains insufficiently evaluated, typically embedded within broader
mathematical and logical assessments. Existing evaluations often rely on IQ
tests or math competitions that may overlap with training data, compromising
assessment reliability. To this end, we introduce SpatialViz-Bench, a
comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for spatial visualization with 12 tasks
across 4 sub-abilities, comprising 1,180 automatically generated problems. Our
evaluation of 33 state-of-the-art MLLMs not only reveals wide performance
variations and demonstrates the benchmark's strong discriminative power, but
also uncovers counter-intuitive findings: models exhibit unexpected behaviors
by showing difficulty perception that misaligns with human intuition,
displaying dramatic 2D-to-3D performance cliffs, and defaulting to formula
derivation despite spatial tasks requiring visualization alone. SpatialVizBench
empirically demonstrates that state-of-the-art MLLMs continue to exhibit
deficiencies in spatial visualization tasks, thereby addressing a significant
lacuna in the field. The benchmark is publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLU introduces a Vision-Language Uncertainty framework for reliable UQ and failure prediction in VLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of reliable uncertainty quantification and failure prediction in Vision-Language Models.

Method: ViLU integrates visual and textual embeddings via cross-attention, training a binary classifier for uncertainty prediction using weighted binary cross-entropy loss.

Result: Significant performance gains on datasets like ImageNet-1k, CC12M, and LAION-400M, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: ViLU's architecture and training are critical for effective uncertainty quantification, offering a robust post-hoc solution for VLMs.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open
challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new
Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes
uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations.
ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating
the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned
textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based
on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier
to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary
cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed
approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text
embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive
experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method
compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to
standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale
image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight
the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective
uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found

*Zhitao Wang,Hengyu Man,Wenrui Li,Xingtao Wang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T-GVC is a novel generative video coding framework that uses trajectory-guided motion sampling and diffusion processes to improve video reconstruction in ultra-low bitrate scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods are limited by domain specificity or reliance on high-level text guidance, often failing to capture motion details and producing unrealistic results.

Method: T-GVC employs semantic-aware sparse motion sampling and trajectory-aligned loss constraints in diffusion processes to bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantics.

Result: T-GVC outperforms traditional codecs and state-of-the-art methods in ultra-low bitrate conditions and achieves better motion control than text-guided approaches.

Conclusion: T-GVC introduces a new direction for generative video coding by leveraging geometric motion modeling, offering improved performance and motion accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging
paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate
reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong
generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain
specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on
high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and
results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose
a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC
employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge
low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting
pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic
importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving
critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating
trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a
training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible
motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative
models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both
traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods
under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our
approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided
methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided
by geometric motion modeling.

*F. Xavier Gaya-Morey,Julia Sanchez-Perez,Cristina Manresa-Yee,Jose M. Buades-Rubio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses age-related bias in deep learning-based Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems, focusing on the elderly. It identifies disparities in recognition and attention, proposes three mitigation strategies, and demonstrates improved accuracy for elderly individuals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning FER models often exhibit demographic biases, particularly age-related, compromising fairness and reliability. This study aims to understand and mitigate these biases, especially for the elderly.

Method: The study investigates recognition performance across age groups, identifies affected expressions, and analyzes model attention using Explainable AI (XAI). It proposes three bias mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted Loss, evaluated on AffectNet and benchmark datasets.

Result: Results show improved recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, especially for expressions like "neutral", "sadness", and "anger". Saliency heatmaps indicate models attend to more relevant facial regions for each age group.

Conclusion: Age-related bias in FER can be mitigated with simple training modifications, and approximate demographic labels are valuable for fairness in affective computing.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) systems based on deep learning have
achieved impressive performance in recent years. However, these models often
exhibit demographic biases, particularly with respect to age, which can
compromise their fairness and reliability. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of age-related bias in deep FER models, with a particular
focus on the elderly population. We first investigate whether recognition
performance varies across age groups, which expressions are most affected, and
whether model attention differs depending on age. Using Explainable AI (XAI)
techniques, we identify systematic disparities in expression recognition and
attention patterns, especially for "neutral", "sadness", and "anger" in elderly
individuals. Based on these findings, we propose and evaluate three bias
mitigation strategies: Multi-task Learning, Multi-modal Input, and Age-weighted
Loss. Our models are trained on a large-scale dataset, AffectNet, with
automatically estimated age labels and validated on balanced benchmark datasets
that include underrepresented age groups. Results show consistent improvements
in recognition accuracy for elderly individuals, particularly for the most
error-prone expressions. Saliency heatmap analysis reveals that models trained
with age-aware strategies attend to more relevant facial regions for each age
group, helping to explain the observed improvements. These findings suggest
that age-related bias in FER can be effectively mitigated using simple training
modifications, and that even approximate demographic labels can be valuable for
promoting fairness in large-scale affective computing systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MolCLIP combines cell video and molecular data to improve drug MoA recognition using a multimodal approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on spatial cell features but ignore temporal dynamics and molecular data, limiting MoA understanding.

Method: Proposes MolCLIP, a visual language model integrating microscopic cell videos and molecular data with a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework and metric learning.

Result: Achieves 51.2% and 20.5% mAP improvements in drug identification and MoA recognition on MitoDataset.

Conclusion: MolCLIP effectively leverages multimodal data to enhance MoA recognition, addressing limitations of prior methods.

Abstract: Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules
interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical
application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by
relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various
drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while
overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more
suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules
can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates
that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This
paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic
cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP
framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular
latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP
to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the
MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5%
in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ARNet, a deep learning model for efficient keypoint annotation in cervical vertebrae analysis to predict pediatric orthodontic growth potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate growth potential estimation is crucial for effective pediatric orthodontic treatment, but manual keypoint annotation is labor-intensive.

Method: ARNet, an interactive deep learning model, uses an Interaction-guided recalibration network and morphology-aware loss to streamline keypoint annotation.

Result: ARNet reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and performs well across datasets, proving its applicability in medical imaging.

Conclusion: ARNet advances pediatric orthodontics by providing an efficient AI-assisted tool for growth potential assessment.

Abstract: In pediatric orthodontics, accurate estimation of growth potential is
essential for developing effective treatment strategies. Our research aims to
predict this potential by identifying the growth peak and analyzing cervical
vertebra morphology solely through lateral cephalometric radiographs. We
accomplish this by comprehensively analyzing cervical vertebral maturation
(CVM) features from these radiographs. This methodology provides clinicians
with a reliable and efficient tool to determine the optimal timings for
orthodontic interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes. A crucial
aspect of this approach is the meticulous annotation of keypoints on the
cervical vertebrae, a task often challenged by its labor-intensive nature. To
mitigate this, we introduce Attend-and-Refine Network (ARNet), a
user-interactive, deep learning-based model designed to streamline the
annotation process. ARNet features Interaction-guided recalibration network,
which adaptively recalibrates image features in response to user feedback,
coupled with a morphology-aware loss function that preserves the structural
consistency of keypoints. This novel approach substantially reduces manual
effort in keypoint identification, thereby enhancing the efficiency and
accuracy of the process. Extensively validated across various datasets, ARNet
demonstrates remarkable performance and exhibits wide-ranging applicability in
medical imaging. In conclusion, our research offers an effective AI-assisted
diagnostic tool for assessing growth potential in pediatric orthodontics,
marking a significant advancement in the field.

TL;DR: The paper introduces AU-DFER, an AU-enhanced dynamic facial expression recognition architecture that integrates AU-expression knowledge to improve deep learning models. It outperforms SOTA methods and addresses data label imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance dynamic facial expression recognition by incorporating quantified AU-expression knowledge and tackling data imbalance issues in existing datasets.

Method: AU-DFER integrates AU knowledge via a weight matrix and AU loss, validated on mainstream DFER models and datasets.

Result: The architecture outperforms SOTA methods without extra computation and improves results. It also addresses label imbalance effectively.

Conclusion: Integrating AU knowledge and diverse loss function designs enhances DFER, highlighting the importance of addressing data imbalance.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition(DFER) is a rapidly evolving field of
research that focuses on the recognition of time-series facial expressions.
While previous research on DFER has concentrated on feature learning from a
deep learning perspective, we put forward an AU-enhanced Dynamic Facial
Expression Recognition architecture, namely AU-DFER, that incorporates
AU-expression knowledge to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning modeling.
In particular, the contribution of the Action Units(AUs) to different
expressions is quantified, and a weight matrix is designed to incorporate a
priori knowledge. Subsequently, the knowledge is integrated with the learning
outcomes of a conventional deep learning network through the introduction of AU
loss. The design is incorporated into the existing optimal model for dynamic
expression recognition for the purpose of validation. Experiments are conducted
on three recent mainstream open-source approaches to DFER on the principal
datasets in this field. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture
outperforms the state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods without the need for additional
arithmetic and generally produces improved results. Furthermore, we investigate
the potential of AU loss function redesign to address data label imbalance
issues in established dynamic expression datasets. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate quantified AU-expression
knowledge into various DFER models. We also devise strategies to tackle label
imbalance, or minor class problems. Our findings suggest that employing a
diverse strategy of loss function design can enhance the effectiveness of DFER.
This underscores the criticality of addressing data imbalance challenges in
mainstream datasets within this domain. The source code is available at

TL;DR: The paper introduces rationale-enhanced decoding (RED) to improve multi-modal reasoning in large vision-language models (LVLMs) by ensuring generated rationales are utilized, unlike standard chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs often ignore generated rationales in CoT reasoning, undermining grounding and accuracy.

Method: Reformulates multi-modal CoT as KL-constrained reward maximization and proposes RED, a plug-and-play decoding strategy that harmonizes visual and rationale information.

Result: RED consistently outperforms standard CoT and other methods across benchmarks and LVLMs, enhancing faithfulness and accuracy.

Conclusion: RED provides a practical solution for more reliable rationale-grounded multi-modal systems.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities by integrating pre-trained vision encoders with large language
models (LLMs). Similar to single-modal LLMs, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting
has been adapted for LVLMs to enhance multi-modal reasoning by generating
intermediate rationales based on visual and textual inputs. While CoT is
assumed to improve grounding and accuracy in LVLMs, our experiments reveal a
key challenge: existing LVLMs often ignore the contents of generated rationales
in CoT reasoning. To address this, we re-formulate multi-modal CoT reasoning as
a KL-constrained reward maximization focused on rationale-conditional
log-likelihood. As the optimal solution, we propose rationale-enhanced decoding
(RED), a novel plug-and-play inference-time decoding strategy. RED harmonizes
visual and rationale information by multiplying distinct image-conditional and
rationale-conditional next token distributions. Extensive experiments show that
RED consistently and significantly improves reasoning over standard CoT and
other decoding methods across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs. Our work offers a
practical and effective approach to improve both the faithfulness and accuracy
of CoT reasoning in LVLMs, paving the way for more reliable rationale-grounded
multi-modal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Tree-Mamba, a novel method for underwater monocular depth estimation (UMDE), addressing challenges like degraded images and unreliable depth labels. It proposes a tree-aware scanning strategy and a new benchmark dataset, BlueDepth, achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods struggle with UMDE due to inflexible state scanning and unreliable depth labels in existing datasets. The paper aims to improve depth estimation accuracy in underwater environments.

Method: The authors develop Tree-Mamba, featuring a tree-aware scanning strategy that constructs a minimum spanning tree based on feature similarity and aggregates spatial topological features through traversals. They also create the BlueDepth dataset with reliable depth labels.

Result: Tree-Mamba outperforms leading methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating strong multi-scale feature representation and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed Tree-Mamba and BlueDepth dataset effectively address UMDE challenges, offering improved accuracy and reliable training data for future research.

Abstract: Underwater Monocular Depth Estimation (UMDE) is a critical task that aims to
estimate high-precision depth maps from underwater degraded images caused by
light absorption and scattering effects in marine environments. Recently,
Mamba-based methods have achieved promising performance across various vision
tasks; however, they struggle with the UMDE task because their inflexible state
scanning strategies fail to model the structural features of underwater images
effectively. Meanwhile, existing UMDE datasets usually contain unreliable depth
labels, leading to incorrect object-depth relationships between underwater
images and their corresponding depth maps. To overcome these limitations, we
develop a novel tree-aware Mamba method, dubbed Tree-Mamba, for estimating
accurate monocular depth maps from underwater degraded images. Specifically, we
propose a tree-aware scanning strategy that adaptively constructs a minimum
spanning tree based on feature similarity. The spatial topological features
among the tree nodes are then flexibly aggregated through bottom-up and
top-down traversals, enabling stronger multi-scale feature representation
capabilities. Moreover, we construct an underwater depth estimation benchmark
(called BlueDepth), which consists of 38,162 underwater image pairs with
reliable depth labels. This benchmark serves as a foundational dataset for
training existing deep learning-based UMDE methods to learn accurate
object-depth relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed Tree-Mamba over several leading methods in both qualitative
results and quantitative evaluations with competitive computational efficiency.

*Wei Shang,Dongwei Ren,Wanying Zhang,Pengfei Zhu,Qinghua Hu,Wangmeng Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to address local motion blur in images by using a trainable mask predictor and an intra-frame motion analyzer, reducing computational costs while improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deblurring methods struggle with inefficient resource allocation and handling spatially varying blur patterns.

Method: A trainable mask predictor identifies blurred regions, and structural reparameterization optimizes inference. An intra-frame motion analyzer translates pixel displacements into motion trajectories for adaptive blur restoration.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing FLOPs by 49% and achieving superior performance on blur datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses local motion blur with computational efficiency and improved accuracy.

Abstract: Local motion blur in digital images originates from the relative motion
between dynamic objects and static imaging systems during exposure. Existing
deblurring methods face significant challenges in addressing this problem due
to their inefficient allocation of computational resources and inadequate
handling of spatially varying blur patterns. To overcome these limitations, we
first propose a trainable mask predictor that identifies blurred regions in the
image. During training, we employ blur masks to exclude sharp regions. For
inference optimization, we implement structural reparameterization by
converting $3\times 3$ convolutions to computationally efficient $1\times 1$
convolutions, enabling pixel-level pruning of sharp areas to reduce
computation. Second, we develop an intra-frame motion analyzer that translates
relative pixel displacements into motion trajectories, establishing adaptive
guidance for region-specific blur restoration. Our method is trained end-to-end
using a combination of reconstruction loss, reblur loss, and mask loss guided
by annotated blur masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods on both local and global blur datasets while
reducing FLOPs by 49\% compared to SOTA models (e.g., LMD-ViT). The source code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossVLAD is a benchmark dataset for evaluating cross-task adversarial attacks on unified vision-language models (VLMs), introducing CRAFT as an efficient attack method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing security challenges in unified VLMs due to adversarial inputs needing effectiveness across unpredictable task instructions.

Method: Introduces CrossVLAD, a dataset with GPT-4 annotations, and CRAFT, a region-based attack framework.

Result: CRAFT outperforms existing methods in cross-task attack performance and targeted object-change success rates.

Conclusion: CRAFT effectively adversarially influences unified VLMs across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Unified vision-language models(VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress,
enabling a single model to flexibly address diverse tasks through different
instructions within a shared computational architecture. This instruction-based
control mechanism creates unique security challenges, as adversarial inputs
must remain effective across multiple task instructions that may be
unpredictably applied to process the same malicious content. In this paper, we
introduce CrossVLAD, a new benchmark dataset carefully curated from MSCOCO with
GPT-4-assisted annotations for systematically evaluating cross-task adversarial
attacks on unified VLMs. CrossVLAD centers on the object-change
objective-consistently manipulating a target object's classification across
four downstream tasks-and proposes a novel success rate metric that measures
simultaneous misclassification across all tasks, providing a rigorous
evaluation of adversarial transferability. To tackle this challenge, we present
CRAFT (Cross-task Region-based Attack Framework with Token-alignment), an
efficient region-centric attack method. Extensive experiments on Florence-2 and
other popular unified VLMs demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches in both overall cross-task attack performance and targeted
object-change success rates, highlighting its effectiveness in adversarially

### [107] [Understanding Dataset Bias in Medical Imaging: A Case Study on Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07722)
*Ethan Dack,Chengliang Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study revisits the 'Name that dataset' task for chest X-ray datasets to explore bias, applying transformations to identify shortcuts in AI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate if dataset bias exists in medical imaging datasets, given their sensitivity and popularity in research.

Method: Applied dataset transformations and tested various network architectures on NIH, CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR, and PadChest datasets.

Result: Findings aim to reveal whether AI methods rely on dataset bias or focus on pathology.

Conclusion: Encourages explainable research and more open-source medical datasets; code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Recent work has revisited the infamous task Name that dataset and established
that in non-medical datasets, there is an underlying bias and achieved high
Accuracies on the dataset origin task. In this work, we revisit the same task
applied to popular open-source chest X-ray datasets. Medical images are
naturally more difficult to release for open-source due to their sensitive
nature, which has led to certain open-source datasets being extremely popular
for research purposes. By performing the same task, we wish to explore whether
dataset bias also exists in these datasets. % We deliberately try to increase
the difficulty of the task by dataset transformations. We apply simple
transformations of the datasets to try to identify bias. Given the importance
of AI applications in medical imaging, it's vital to establish whether modern
methods are taking shortcuts or are focused on the relevant pathology. We
implement a range of different network architectures on the datasets: NIH,
CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. We hope this work will encourage more
explainable research being performed in medical imaging and the creation of
more open-source datasets in the medical domain. The corresponding code will be
released upon acceptance.

*Yukang Chen,Wei Huang,Baifeng Shi,Qinghao Hu,Hanrong Ye,Ligeng Zhu,Zhijian Liu,Pavlo Molchanov,Jan Kautz,Xiaojuan Qi,Sifei Liu,Hongxu Yin,Yao Lu,Song Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for scaling reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos using reinforcement learning, featuring a dataset, training pipeline, and infrastructure for efficient long video RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of long video reasoning in VLMs by integrating a large-scale dataset, a two-stage training pipeline, and efficient RL infrastructure.

Method: Combines chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP) for efficient training.

Result: LongVILA-R1-7B outperforms benchmarks like VideoMME and matches Gemini-1.5-Pro in reasoning tasks, with MR-SP achieving 2.1x speedup in RL training.

Conclusion: LongVILA-R1 advances long video reasoning in VLMs, with released training system supporting RL on diverse modalities and models.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in
vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement
learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by
integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset,
LongVideo-Reason, comprising 52K long video QA pairs with high-quality
reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs;
(2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought
supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a
training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement
Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a
vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for
efficient rollout and prefilling. In experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves
strong performance on long video QA benchmarks such as VideoMME. It also
outperforms Video-R1-7B and even matches Gemini-1.5-Pro across temporal
reasoning, goal and purpose reasoning, spatial reasoning, and plot reasoning on
our LongVideo-Reason-eval benchmark. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to
2.1x speedup on long video RL training. LongVILA-R1 demonstrates consistent
performance gains as the number of input video frames scales. LongVILA-R1 marks
a firm step towards long video reasoning in VLMs. In addition, we release our
training system for public availability that supports RL training on various
modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and
even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it
supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames / around 256k
tokens).

*Théo Danielou,Daniel Tordjman,Pierre Manceron,Corentin Dancette*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A simplified 3D promptable segmentation method is introduced to address the limitations of SAM in handling 3D medical imaging, reducing inference time and complexity while maintaining high performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM's 2D architecture is inefficient for 3D medical imaging (e.g., CT/MRI), requiring complex adaptations like autoregressive or sliding-window strategies, which increase inference time and resource usage.

Method: The proposed method, inspired by SegVol, simplifies 3D segmentation by eliminating sliding-window complexities and improving efficiency.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced inference time and simplified prompt management.

Conclusion: The approach effectively adapts promptable segmentation to 3D medical imaging, offering a practical solution for clinical use.

Abstract: Promptable segmentation, introduced by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), is a
promising approach for medical imaging, as it enables clinicians to guide and
refine model predictions interactively. However, SAM's architecture is designed
for 2D images and does not extend naturally to 3D volumetric data such as CT or
MRI scans. Adapting 2D models to 3D typically involves autoregressive
strategies, where predictions are propagated slice by slice, resulting in
increased inference complexity. Processing large 3D volumes also requires
significant computational resources, often leading existing 3D methods to also
adopt complex strategies like sliding-window inference to manage memory usage,
at the cost of longer inference times and greater implementation complexity. In
this paper, we present a simplified 3D promptable segmentation method, inspired
by SegVol, designed to reduce inference time and eliminate prompt management
complexities associated with sliding windows while achieving state-of-the-art
performance.

### [110] [Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning: Evaluation and Methodology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07999)
*Haochen Wang,Xiangtai Li,Zilong Huang,Anran Wang,Jiacong Wang,Tao Zhang,Jiani Zheng,Sule Bai,Zijian Kang,Jiashi Feng,Zhuochen Wang,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TreeBench is a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning, focusing on traceable evidence and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR, a training paradigm, improves performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models lack a holistic benchmark for evaluating visual grounded reasoning capabilities, especially for traceable evidence and complex reasoning.

Method: TreeBench is built on three principles: focused visual perception, traceable evidence via bounding boxes, and second-order reasoning. TreeVGR uses reinforcement learning to jointly supervise localization and reasoning.

Result: TreeBench includes 405 challenging QA pairs, with advanced models scoring below 60% accuracy. TreeVGR improves performance on V* Bench, MME-RealWorld, and TreeBench.

Conclusion: Traceability is crucial for advancing vision-grounded reasoning, and TreeBench and TreeVGR provide effective tools for evaluation and improvement.

Abstract: Models like OpenAI-o3 pioneer visual grounded reasoning by dynamically
referencing visual regions, just like human "thinking with images". However, no
benchmark exists to evaluate these capabilities holistically. To bridge this
gap, we propose TreeBench (Traceable Evidence Evaluation Benchmark), a
diagnostic benchmark built on three principles: (1) focused visual perception
of subtle targets in complex scenes, (2) traceable evidence via bounding box
evaluation, and (3) second-order reasoning to test object interactions and
spatial hierarchies beyond simple object localization. Prioritizing images with
dense objects, we initially sample 1K high-quality images from SA-1B, and
incorporate eight LMM experts to manually annotate questions, candidate
options, and answers for each image. After three stages of quality control,
TreeBench consists of 405 challenging visual question-answering pairs, even the
most advanced models struggle with this benchmark, where none of them reach 60%
accuracy, e.g., OpenAI-o3 scores only 54.87. Furthermore, we introduce TreeVGR
(Traceable Evidence Enhanced Visual Grounded Reasoning), a training paradigm to
supervise localization and reasoning jointly with reinforcement learning,
enabling accurate localizations and explainable reasoning pathways. Initialized
from Qwen2.5-VL-7B, it improves V* Bench (+16.8), MME-RealWorld (+12.6), and
TreeBench (+13.4), proving traceability is key to advancing vision-grounded
reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/Haochen-Wang409/TreeVGR.

### [111] [Energy-Guided Decoding for Object Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07731)
*Xixi Liu,Ailin Deng,Christopher Zach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an energy-based decoding method to reduce object hallucination and bias in large vision-language models, improving accuracy and F1 scores across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the imbalance in 'Yes' ratios and object hallucination in VLMs for safer deployment.

Method: Energy-based decoding dynamically selects hidden states from layers with minimal energy scores.

Result: Improves accuracy by 4.82% and reduces yes-ratio bias by 8.81% across three benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively mitigates bias and enhances performance in VLMs.

Abstract: Mitigating object hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) is
critical to their safe deployment. Existing methods either are restricted to
specific decoding methods, or demand sophisticated modifications to visual
inputs, or rely on knowledge from external models. In this work, we first
reveal the phenomenon that VLMs exhibit significant imbalance in the ``Yes''
ratio ( \ie, the fraction of ``Yes'' answers among the total number of
questions) across three different visual question answering (VQA) datasets.
Furthermore, we propose an energy-based decoding method, which dynamically
selects the hidden states from the layer with minimal energy score. It is
simple yet effective in reducing the bias for the yes ratio while boosting
performance across three benchmarks (POPE, MME, and MMVP). Our method
consistently improves accuracy and F1 score on three VQA datasets across three
commonly used VLMs over several baseline methods. The average accuracy
improvement is 4.82% compared to greedy decoding. Moreover, the average
yes-ratio gap reduction is 8.81%, meaning the proposed method is less biased as
shown in Figure 1.

### [112] [EEvAct: Early Event-Based Action Recognition with High-Rate Two-Stream Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07734)
*Michael Neumeier,Jules Lecomte,Nils Kazinski,Soubarna Banik,Bing Li,Axel von Arnim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stream spiking neural network (SNN) improves early human activity recognition with event-based vision sensors, outperforming previous methods by 2% in accuracy on the THU EACT-50 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early recognition of human activities is vital for safety and responsiveness in human-robot interfaces, and event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution but current methods limit early prediction.

Method: The paper introduces a high-rate two-stream SNN to process events for early predictions, benchmarked using Top-1 and Top-5 scores over growing observation times.

Result: The proposed SNN outperforms prior work by 2% in final accuracy on the THU EACT-50 dataset.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates practical impact in early action triggering for human motion capture in sports, showcasing its real-world applicability.

Abstract: Recognizing human activities early is crucial for the safety and
responsiveness of human-robot and human-machine interfaces. Due to their high
temporal resolution and low latency, event-based vision sensors are a perfect
match for this early recognition demand. However, most existing processing
approaches accumulate events to low-rate frames or space-time voxels which
limits the early prediction capabilities. In contrast, spiking neural networks
(SNNs) can process the events at a high-rate for early predictions, but most
works still fall short on final accuracy. In this work, we introduce a
high-rate two-stream SNN which closes this gap by outperforming previous work
by 2% in final accuracy on the large-scale THU EACT-50 dataset. We benchmark
the SNNs within a novel early event-based recognition framework by reporting
Top-1 and Top-5 recognition scores for growing observation time. Finally, we
exemplify the impact of these methods on a real-world task of early action
triggering for human motion capture in sports.

*David Pujol-Perich,Sergio Escalera,Albert Clapés*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SDST, a sparse-dense side-tuning architecture for Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), addressing limitations of prior methods by focusing on sparse moment retrieval and enhancing context modeling with a novel attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for VTG rely on frozen pre-trained backbones, limiting adaptability. Side-tuning (ST) offers a parameter-efficient alternative but overlooks the sparse nature of Moment Retrieval (MR).

Method: Proposes SDST, an anchor-free ST architecture, and introduces Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention for better context modeling. Integrates InternVideo2 backbone into ST framework.

Result: Achieves highly competitive or state-of-the-art results on QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, reducing parameters by up to 73%.

Conclusion: SDST significantly improves ST methods for VTG, offering better performance and efficiency, with publicly available code.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) involves Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight
Detection (HD) based on textual queries. For this, most methods rely solely on
final-layer features of frozen large pre-trained backbones, limiting their
adaptability to new domains. While full fine-tuning is often impractical,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning -- and particularly side-tuning (ST) -- has
emerged as an effective alternative. However, prior ST approaches this problem
from a frame-level refinement perspective, overlooking the inherent sparse
nature of MR. To address this, we propose the Sparse-Dense Side-Tuner (SDST),
the first anchor-free ST architecture for VTG. We also introduce the
Reference-based Deformable Self-Attention, a novel mechanism that enhances the
context modeling of the deformable attention -- a key limitation of existing
anchor-free methods. Additionally, we present the first effective integration
of InternVideo2 backbone into an ST framework, showing its profound
implications in performance. Overall, our method significantly improves
existing ST methods, achieving highly competitive or SOTA results on
QVHighlights, TACoS, and Charades-STA, while reducing up to a 73% the parameter
count w.r.t. the existing SOTA methods. The code is publicly accessible at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-RAFT improves fluorescence-guided neurosurgery by enabling cross-modal image alignment between blue and white light hyperspectral images, reducing errors by 36.6% over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing surgical decision-making with real-time quantitative fluorescence measurements requires accurate cross-modal image alignment in dynamic surgical environments.

Method: Introduces X-RAFT, a modified RAFT optical flow model with distinct encoders for each modality, fine-tuned self-supervised using flow-cycle-consistency.

Result: Achieves 36.6% error reduction over naive baselines and 27.83% over CrossRAFT.

Conclusion: X-RAFT effectively addresses cross-modal alignment challenges, promising improved surgical outcomes with public release planned post-review.

Abstract: Integration of hyperspectral imaging into fluorescence-guided neurosurgery
has the potential to improve surgical decision making by providing quantitative
fluorescence measurements in real-time. Quantitative fluorescence requires
paired spectral data in fluorescence (blue light) and reflectance (white light)
mode. Blue and white image acquisition needs to be performed sequentially in a
potentially dynamic surgical environment. A key component to the fluorescence
quantification process is therefore the ability to find dense cross-modal image
correspondences between two hyperspectral images taken under these drastically
different lighting conditions. We address this challenge with the introduction
of X-RAFT, a Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT) optical flow model
modified for cross-modal inputs. We propose using distinct image encoders for
each modality pair, and fine-tune these in a self-supervised manner using
flow-cycle-consistency on our neurosurgical hyperspectral data. We show an
error reduction of 36.6% across our evaluation metrics when comparing to a
naive baseline and 27.83% reduction compared to an existing cross-modal optical
flow method (CrossRAFT). Our code and models will be made publicly available
after the review process.

*Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Bardia Hejazi,Konstantin Poka,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning-based method improves geometric accuracy in additive manufacturing by comparing CAD and XCT volumes, outperforming traditional DVC methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing geometric inaccuracies in AM components caused by shrinkage and deformations, which are critical for industries like automotive, medical, and aerospace.

Method: Uses a deep learning approach with dynamic patch-based processing for high-resolution XCT volumes and introduces a Binary Difference Map (BDM) for evaluation.

Result: Achieves 9.2% better Dice Score and 9.9% higher voxel match rate than classic DVC, reducing processing time from days to minutes.

Conclusion: The method enhances AM reliability and efficiency, paving the way for closed-loop compensation in production.

Abstract: Quality control in additive manufacturing (AM) is vital for industrial
applications in areas such as the automotive, medical and aerospace sectors.
Geometric inaccuracies caused by shrinkage and deformations can compromise the
life and performance of additively manufactured components. Such deviations can
be quantified using Digital Volume Correlation (DVC), which compares the
computer-aided design (CAD) model with the X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT)
geometry of the components produced. However, accurate registration between the
two modalities is challenging due to the absence of a ground truth or reference
deformation field. In addition, the extremely large data size of
high-resolution XCT volumes makes computation difficult. In this work, we
present a deep learning-based approach for estimating voxel-wise deformations
between CAD and XCT volumes. Our method uses a dynamic patch-based processing
strategy to handle high-resolution volumes. In addition to the Dice Score, we
introduce a Binary Difference Map (BDM) that quantifies voxel-wise mismatches
between binarized CAD and XCT volumes to evaluate the accuracy of the
registration. Our approach shows a 9.2\% improvement in the Dice Score and a
9.9\% improvement in the voxel match rate compared to classic DVC methods,
while reducing the interaction time from days to minutes. This work sets the
foundation for deep learning-based DVC methods to generate compensation meshes
that can then be used in closed-loop correlations during the AM production
process. Such a system would be of great interest to industries since the
manufacturing process will become more reliable and efficient, saving time and
material.

*Dren Fazlija,Monty-Maximilian Zühlke,Johanna Schrader,Arkadij Orlov,Clara Stein,Iyiola E. Olatunji,Daniel Kudenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOOTER is a framework for evaluating unrestricted adversarial attacks, providing guidelines, tools, and a benchmark dataset, revealing mismatches between human and model perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional defenses against adversarial attacks rely on norm-bounded constraints, but unrestricted attacks bypass these, requiring human evaluation for imperceptibility. Current methods lack statistical rigor, necessitating a unified framework.

Method: Introduces SCOOTER, an open-source framework with best-practice guidelines, large-scale human vs. model comparisons, and tools for annotation and analysis.

Result: Human evaluations showed three color-space and three diffusion-based attacks failed to produce imperceptible images. GPT-4o detected only four of six attacks.

Conclusion: Automated vision systems misalign with human perception, highlighting the need for SCOOTER as a benchmark for unrestricted adversarial attack evaluation.

Abstract: Unrestricted adversarial attacks aim to fool computer vision models without
being constrained by $\ell_p$-norm bounds to remain imperceptible to humans,
for example, by changing an object's color. This allows attackers to circumvent
traditional, norm-bounded defense strategies such as adversarial training or
certified defense strategies. However, due to their unrestricted nature, there
are also no guarantees of norm-based imperceptibility, necessitating human
evaluations to verify just how authentic these adversarial examples look. While
some related work assesses this vital quality of adversarial attacks, none
provide statistically significant insights. This issue necessitates a unified
framework that supports and streamlines such an assessment for evaluating and
comparing unrestricted attacks. To close this gap, we introduce SCOOTER - an
open-source, statistically powered framework for evaluating unrestricted
adversarial examples. Our contributions are: $(i)$ best-practice guidelines for
crowd-study power, compensation, and Likert equivalence bounds to measure
imperceptibility; $(ii)$ the first large-scale human vs. model comparison
across 346 human participants showing that three color-space attacks and three
diffusion-based attacks fail to produce imperceptible images. Furthermore, we
found that GPT-4o can serve as a preliminary test for imperceptibility, but it
only consistently detects adversarial examples for four out of six tested
attacks; $(iii)$ open-source software tools, including a browser-based task
template to collect annotations and analysis scripts in Python and R; $(iv)$ an
ImageNet-derived benchmark dataset containing 3K real images, 7K adversarial
examples, and over 34K human ratings. Our findings demonstrate that automated
vision systems do not align with human perception, reinforcing the need for a
ground-truth SCOOTER benchmark.

*Mélanie Roschewitz,Raghav Mehta,Fabio de Sousa Ribeiro,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates calibration techniques for image classification under dataset shift, comparing post-hoc and in-training methods. Key findings include the effectiveness of entropy regularization with label smoothing, robustness of post-hoc calibrators with OOD exposure, and the trade-off between in-distribution and shifted calibration. Ensembling and finetuning from foundation models yield the best results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and improve calibration robustness in image classification under real-world dataset shifts, providing practical guidelines for practitioners.

Method: Comparison of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques across eight classification tasks and various natural shifts, analyzing interactions and trade-offs.

Result: Entropy regularization with label smoothing works best; post-hoc calibrators with OOD exposure are robust; ensembling and finetuning from foundation models improve calibration.

Conclusion: Effective calibration under shift requires combining in-training and post-hoc methods, with ensembling and finetuning offering the best robustness.

Abstract: We conduct an extensive study on the state of calibration under real-world
dataset shift for image classification. Our work provides important insights on
the choice of post-hoc and in-training calibration techniques, and yields
practical guidelines for all practitioners interested in robust calibration
under shift. We compare various post-hoc calibration methods, and their
interactions with common in-training calibration strategies (e.g., label
smoothing), across a wide range of natural shifts, on eight different
classification tasks across several imaging domains. We find that: (i)
simultaneously applying entropy regularisation and label smoothing yield the
best calibrated raw probabilities under dataset shift, (ii) post-hoc
calibrators exposed to a small amount of semantic out-of-distribution data
(unrelated to the task) are most robust under shift, (iii) recent calibration
methods specifically aimed at increasing calibration under shifts do not
necessarily offer significant improvements over simpler post-hoc calibration
methods, (iv) improving calibration under shifts often comes at the cost of
worsening in-distribution calibration. Importantly, these findings hold for
randomly initialised classifiers, as well as for those finetuned from
foundation models, the latter being consistently better calibrated compared to
models trained from scratch. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of
ensembling effects, finding that (i) applying calibration prior to ensembling
(instead of after) is more effective for calibration under shifts, (ii) for
ensembles, OOD exposure deteriorates the ID-shifted calibration trade-off,
(iii) ensembling remains one of the most effective methods to improve
calibration robustness and, combined with finetuning from foundation models,
yields best calibration results overall.

TL;DR: The paper introduces S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset for evaluating language-guided spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, addressing biases in existing datasets and challenging current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D vision-language research lacks focus on spatial reasoning, with datasets often biased by semantic cues. This gap hinders genuine spatial understanding in AI systems.

Method: The authors created S\textsc{urprise}3D, a dataset with 200k+ vision-language pairs from 900+ indoor scenes, featuring 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries devoid of object names to avoid biases.

Result: Benchmarks show current 3D visual grounding methods and 3D-LLMs struggle with the dataset, highlighting its necessity for advancing spatial reasoning in AI.

Conclusion: S\textsc{urprise}3D and the 3D-SRS benchmark aim to improve spatially aware AI, supporting embodied interaction and robotic planning.

Abstract: The integration of language and 3D perception is critical for embodied AI and
robotic systems to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world.
Spatial reasoning, a key capability for understanding spatial relationships
between objects, remains underexplored in current 3D vision-language research.
Existing datasets often mix semantic cues (e.g., object name) with spatial
context, leading models to rely on superficial shortcuts rather than genuinely
interpreting spatial relationships. To address this gap, we introduce
S\textsc{urprise}3D, a novel dataset designed to evaluate language-guided
spatial reasoning segmentation in complex 3D scenes. S\textsc{urprise}3D
consists of more than 200k vision language pairs across 900+ detailed indoor
scenes from ScanNet++ v2, including more than 2.8k unique object classes. The
dataset contains 89k+ human-annotated spatial queries deliberately crafted
without object name, thereby mitigating shortcut biases in spatial
understanding. These queries comprehensively cover various spatial reasoning
skills, such as relative position, narrative perspective, parametric
perspective, and absolute distance reasoning. Initial benchmarks demonstrate
significant challenges for current state-of-the-art expert 3D visual grounding
methods and 3D-LLMs, underscoring the necessity of our dataset and the
accompanying 3D Spatial Reasoning Segmentation (3D-SRS) benchmark suite.
S\textsc{urprise}3D and 3D-SRS aim to facilitate advancements in spatially
aware AI, paving the way for effective embodied interaction and robotic
planning. The code and datasets can be found in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing rPPG models lack accuracy, robustness, and generalization in complex scenarios.

Method: Uses 3D CNNs, differential frame fusion, TSM with self-attention, and a dynamic hybrid loss function.

Result: Achieves MAE of 7.58 on MMPD test set, surpassing state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: The proposed network demonstrates superior robustness and generalization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Non-contact remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology enables heart rate
measurement from facial videos. However, existing network models still face
challenges in accu racy, robustness, and generalization capability under
complex scenarios. This paper proposes an end-to-end rPPG extraction network
that employs 3D convolutional neural networks to reconstruct accurate rPPG
signals from raw facial videos. We introduce a differential frame fusion module
that integrates differential frames with original frames, enabling frame-level
representations to capture blood volume pulse (BVP) variations. Additionally,
we incorporate Temporal Shift Module (TSM) with self-attention mechanisms,
which effectively enhance rPPG features with minimal computational overhead.
Furthermore, we propose a novel dynamic hybrid loss function that provides
stronger supervision for the network, effectively mitigating over fitting.
Comprehensive experiments were conducted on not only the PURE and UBFC-rPPG
datasets but also the challenging MMPD dataset under complex scenarios,
involving both intra dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, which demonstrate
the superior robustness and generalization capability of our network.
Specifically, after training on PURE, our model achieved a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 7.58 on the MMPD test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art models.

*Xi Xiao,Yunbei Zhang,Xingjian Li,Tianyang Wang,Xiao Wang,Yuxiang Wei,Jihun Hamm,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViaPT introduces instance-aware prompts for vision transformers, combining them with dataset-level prompts using PCA, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional VPT uses static dataset-level prompts, leading to sub-optimal performance due to dataset variance. ViaPT aims to address this by incorporating instance-specific information.

Method: ViaPT generates instance-aware prompts per input, fuses them with dataset-level prompts using PCA, and balances dataset- and instance-level knowledge.

Result: ViaPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 34 diverse datasets, reducing learnable parameters compared to VPT-Deep.

Conclusion: ViaPT establishes a new paradigm for optimizing visual prompts, effectively balancing dataset and instance knowledge for improved performance.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) has emerged as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning
paradigm for vision transformers, with conventional approaches utilizing
dataset-level prompts that remain the same across all input instances. We
observe that this strategy results in sub-optimal performance due to high
variance in downstream datasets. To address this challenge, we propose Visual
Instance-aware Prompt Tuning (ViaPT), which generates instance-aware prompts
based on each individual input and fuses them with dataset-level prompts,
leveraging Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to retain important prompting
information. Moreover, we reveal that VPT-Deep and VPT-Shallow represent two
corner cases based on a conceptual understanding, in which they fail to
effectively capture instance-specific information, while random dimension
reduction on prompts only yields performance between the two extremes. Instead,
ViaPT overcomes these limitations by balancing dataset-level and instance-level
knowledge, while reducing the amount of learnable parameters compared to
VPT-Deep. Extensive experiments across 34 diverse datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a new
paradigm for analyzing and optimizing visual prompts for vision transformers.

### [121] [Synergistic Prompting for Robust Visual Recognition with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07802)
*Zhihui Zhang,Luanyuan Dai,Qika Lin,Yunfeng Diao,Guangyin Jin,Yufei Guo,Jing Zhang,Xiaoshuai Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework to address performance degradation in multi-modal models due to missing or incomplete inputs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prompt-based methods for handling missing modalities lack flexibility and reliability, especially when critical modalities are absent.

Method: The SyP framework introduces a Dynamic Adapter for adaptive prompt generation and a Synergistic Prompting Strategy to balance information across modalities.

Result: SyP achieves significant performance improvements on three visual recognition datasets, showing robustness under various missing conditions.

Conclusion: The SyP framework effectively handles missing modalities, demonstrating superior adaptability and reliability compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Large-scale multi-modal models have demonstrated remarkable performance
across various visual recognition tasks by leveraging extensive paired
multi-modal training data. However, in real-world applications, the presence of
missing or incomplete modality inputs often leads to significant performance
degradation. Recent research has focused on prompt-based strategies to tackle
this issue; however, existing methods are hindered by two major limitations:
(1) static prompts lack the flexibility to adapt to varying missing-data
conditions, and (2) basic prompt-tuning methods struggle to ensure reliable
performance when critical modalities are missing.To address these challenges,
we propose a novel Synergistic Prompting (SyP) framework for robust visual
recognition with missing modalities. The proposed SyP introduces two key
innovations: (I) a Dynamic Adapter, which computes adaptive scaling factors to
dynamically generate prompts, replacing static parameters for flexible
multi-modal adaptation, and (II) a Synergistic Prompting Strategy, which
combines static and dynamic prompts to balance information across modalities,
ensuring robust reasoning even when key modalities are missing. The proposed
SyP achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches
across three widely-used visual recognition datasets, demonstrating robustness
under diverse missing rates and conditions. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies validate its effectiveness in handling missing modalities, highlighting
its superior adaptability and reliability.

### [122] [Patient-specific vs Multi-Patient Vision Transformer for Markerless Tumor Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07811)
*Gauthier Rotsart de Hertaing,Dani Manjah,Benoit Macq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based approach for markerless lung tumor motion forecasting, comparing patient-specific (PS) and multi-patient (MP) training strategies under clinical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate lung tumor motion forecasting is crucial for proton therapy, but current deep learning methods lack exploration of transformer architectures despite their success in trajectory forecasting.

Method: Two models (PS and MP) were trained using DRRs from 31 patients, with a 32nd for evaluation. PS used patient-specific data, while MP generalized across patients. Performance was measured using ADE and FDE on planning (T1) and treatment (T2) data.

Result: PS models outperformed MP on T1 data, especially with larger datasets, but MP showed robustness to anatomical variability and comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.

Conclusion: ViT-based markerless forecasting is feasible. PS offers precision, while MP provides robust, ready-to-use performance for clinical settings.

Abstract: Background: Accurate forecasting of lung tumor motion is essential for
precise dose delivery in proton therapy. While current markerless methods
mostly rely on deep learning, transformer-based architectures remain unexplored
in this domain, despite their proven performance in trajectory forecasting.
  Purpose: This work introduces a markerless forecasting approach for lung
tumor motion using Vision Transformers (ViT). Two training strategies are
evaluated under clinically realistic constraints: a patient-specific (PS)
approach that learns individualized motion patterns, and a multi-patient (MP)
model designed for generalization. The comparison explicitly accounts for the
limited number of images that can be generated between planning and treatment
sessions.
  Methods: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) derived from planning
4DCT scans of 31 patients were used to train the MP model; a 32nd patient was
held out for evaluation. PS models were trained using only the target patient's
planning data. Both models used 16 DRRs per input and predicted tumor motion
over a 1-second horizon. Performance was assessed using Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), on both planning (T1) and
treatment (T2) data.
  Results: On T1 data, PS models outperformed MP models across all training set
sizes, especially with larger datasets (up to 25,000 DRRs, p < 0.05). However,
MP models demonstrated stronger robustness to inter-fractional anatomical
variability and achieved comparable performance on T2 data without retraining.
  Conclusions: This is the first study to apply ViT architectures to markerless
tumor motion forecasting. While PS models achieve higher precision, MP models
offer robust out-of-the-box performance, well-suited for time-constrained
clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of content-based puzzle solvers under realistic corruptions like missing pieces and eroded edges, finding deep learning models, especially Positional Diffusion, adapt better than heuristic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current puzzle solvers lack evaluation under real-world challenges like fragmented artefacts or shredded documents, limiting their practical application.

Method: Introduces three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions (missing pieces, eroded edges, eroded contents) and evaluates heuristic and deep learning-based solvers.

Result: Standard solvers decline rapidly with corruption, but deep learning models improve robustness via fine-tuning. Positional Diffusion model performs best.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for research to enhance automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts, with deep learning showing promise.

Abstract: Content-based puzzle solvers have been extensively studied, demonstrating
significant progress in computational techniques. However, their evaluation
often lacks realistic challenges crucial for real-world applications, such as
the reassembly of fragmented artefacts or shredded documents. In this work, we
investigate the robustness of State-Of-The-Art content-based puzzle solvers
introducing three types of jigsaw puzzle corruptions: missing pieces, eroded
edges, and eroded contents. Evaluating both heuristic and deep learning-based
solvers, we analyse their ability to handle these corruptions and identify key
limitations. Our results show that solvers developed for standard puzzles have
a rapid decline in performance if more pieces are corrupted. However, deep
learning models can significantly improve their robustness through fine-tuning
with augmented data. Notably, the advanced Positional Diffusion model adapts
particularly well, outperforming its competitors in most experiments. Based on
our findings, we highlight promising research directions for enhancing the
automated reconstruction of real-world artefacts.

*Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Dingyou Wang,Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yu Wu,Guanbin Li,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimCIS is a novel framework for class-incremental/continual image segmentation (CIS) that addresses plasticity loss and data order reliance by leveraging highly aggregated image features for query assignment and introducing cross-stage consistency and visual query replay.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoupled frameworks in CIS suffer from plasticity loss and heavy reliance on input data order, prompting the need for a more robust solution.

Method: SimCIS directly selects image features for query assignment to ensure perfect alignment and introduces cross-stage consistency and visual query replay to combat catastrophic forgetting.

Result: SimCIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders.

Conclusion: SimCIS provides a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS, effectively balancing plasticity and objectness preservation.

Abstract: Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image
segmenter in stages, where the set of available categories differs at each
stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which
mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often
decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study,
however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of
plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct
an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly
aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks
through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple
yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image
features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve
objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to
promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we
introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual
query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks,
settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.

*Paul McHard,Florent P. Audonnet,Oliver Summerell,Sebastian Andraos,Paul Henderson,Gerardo Aragon-Camarasa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 3D-ADAM, a large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for high-precision 3D anomaly detection, addressing the lack of real-world industrial datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surface defects significantly reduce manufacturing yield, but current defect detection methods lack real-world applicability due to insufficient datasets.

Method: The authors created 3D-ADAM, a dataset with 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 parts, including 27,346 annotated defects and 8,110 machine element features, captured in real industrial conditions.

Result: Evaluation of state-of-the-art models shows 3D-ADAM presents a significant challenge, highlighting its industrial relevance and quality.

Conclusion: 3D-ADAM aims to advance robust 3D anomaly detection models for modern manufacturing by providing a realistic benchmark.

Abstract: Surface defects are one of the largest contributors to low yield in the
manufacturing sector. Accurate and reliable detection of defects during the
manufacturing process is therefore of great value across the sector.
State-of-the-art approaches to automated defect detection yield impressive
performance on current datasets, yet still fall short in real-world
manufacturing settings and developing improved methods relies on large datasets
representative of real-world scenarios. Unfortunately, high-quality,
high-precision RGB+3D industrial anomaly detection datasets are scarce, and
typically do not reflect real-world industrial deployment scenarios. To address
this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, the first large-scale industry-relevant dataset for
high-precision 3D Anomaly Detection. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution
scans across 217 unique parts, captured using 4 industrial depth imaging
sensors. It includes 27,346 annotated defect instances from 12 categories,
covering the breadth of industrial surface defects. 3D-ADAM uniquely captures
an additional 8,110 annotations of machine element features, spanning the range
of relevant mechanical design form factors. Unlike existing datasets, 3D-ADAM
is captured in a real industrial environment with variations in part position
and orientation, camera positioning, ambient lighting conditions, as well as
partial occlusions. Our evaluation of SOTA models across various RGB+3D anomaly
detection tasks demonstrates the significant challenge this dataset presents to
current approaches. We further validated the industrial relevance and quality
of the dataset through an expert labelling survey conducted by industry
partners. By providing this challenging benchmark, 3D-ADAM aims to accelerate
the development of robust 3D Anomaly Detection models capable of meeting the
demands of modern manufacturing environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: THUNDER is a benchmark for digital pathology foundation models, enabling efficient comparison, feature analysis, and robustness assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of evaluating concurrent methods in digital pathology and ensure reliable usage in healthcare.

Method: Introduces THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark supporting diverse datasets, downstream tasks, and feature space analysis.

Result: Comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16 datasets, with public code availability.

Conclusion: THUNDER provides a dynamic, easy-to-use tool for benchmarking digital pathology models, emphasizing robustness and uncertainty.

Abstract: Progress in a research field can be hard to assess, in particular when many
concurrent methods are proposed in a short period of time. This is the case in
digital pathology, where many foundation models have been released recently to
serve as feature extractors for tile-level images, being used in a variety of
downstream tasks, both for tile- and slide-level problems. Benchmarking
available methods then becomes paramount to get a clearer view of the research
landscape. In particular, in critical domains such as healthcare, a benchmark
should not only focus on evaluating downstream performance, but also provide
insights about the main differences between methods, and importantly, further
consider uncertainty and robustness to ensure a reliable usage of proposed
models. For these reasons, we introduce THUNDER, a tile-level benchmark for
digital pathology foundation models, allowing for efficient comparison of many
models on diverse datasets with a series of downstream tasks, studying their
feature spaces and assessing the robustness and uncertainty of predictions
informed by their embeddings. THUNDER is a fast, easy-to-use, dynamic benchmark
that can already support a large variety of state-of-the-art foundation, as
well as local user-defined models for direct tile-based comparison. In this
paper, we provide a comprehensive comparison of 23 foundation models on 16
different datasets covering diverse tasks, feature analysis, and robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLURPP combines latent diffusion models and scene decomposition for efficient underwater image restoration, outperforming existing methods in speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing underwater image restoration methods are computationally intensive and produce artifacts in complex scenes.

Method: SLURPP integrates pretrained latent diffusion models with explicit scene decomposition and uses a physics-based synthetic data pipeline for training.

Result: SLURPP is 200X faster than current methods and improves PSNR by ~3 dB on synthetic benchmarks, with better real-world performance.

Conclusion: SLURPP advances underwater image restoration by balancing efficiency and accuracy, validated by synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Underwater image restoration algorithms seek to restore the color, contrast,
and appearance of a scene that is imaged underwater. They are a critical tool
in applications ranging from marine ecology and aquaculture to underwater
construction and archaeology. While existing pixel-domain diffusion-based image
restoration approaches are effective at restoring simple scenes with limited
depth variation, they are computationally intensive and often generate
unrealistic artifacts when applied to scenes with complex geometry and
significant depth variation. In this work we overcome these limitations by
combining a novel network architecture (SLURPP) with an accurate synthetic data
generation pipeline. SLURPP combines pretrained latent diffusion models --
which encode strong priors on the geometry and depth of scenes -- with an
explicit scene decomposition -- which allows one to model and account for the
effects of light attenuation and backscattering. To train SLURPP we design a
physics-based underwater image synthesis pipeline that applies varied and
realistic underwater degradation effects to existing terrestrial image
datasets. This approach enables the generation of diverse training data with
dense medium/degradation annotations. We evaluate our method extensively on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, SLURPP is over 200X faster than existing diffusion-based
methods while offering ~ 3 dB improvement in PSNR on synthetic benchmarks. It
also offers compelling qualitative improvements on real-world data. Project

*Jinhong Wang,Tajamul Ashraf,Zongyan Han,Jorma Laaksonen,Rao Mohammad Anwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MIRA, a framework to improve factual accuracy in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for medical diagnosis by optimizing retrieval-augmented generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often produce factually inconsistent responses in medical contexts, and existing retrieval-augmented methods face challenges like insufficient or excessive retrieval, leading to errors.

Method: MIRA includes a calibrated Rethinking and Rearrangement module to manage retrieval and a medical RAG framework integrating image embeddings and a knowledge base with query-rewrite for multimodal reasoning.

Result: MIRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on medical VQA and report generation benchmarks, significantly improving factual accuracy.

Conclusion: MIRA effectively balances inherent model knowledge with external references, enhancing reliability in AI-assisted medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced
AI-assisted medical diagnosis, but they often generate factually inconsistent
responses that deviate from established medical knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhances factual accuracy by integrating external sources, but
it presents two key challenges. First, insufficient retrieval can miss critical
information, whereas excessive retrieval can introduce irrelevant or misleading
content, disrupting model output. Second, even when the model initially
provides correct answers, over-reliance on retrieved data can lead to factual
errors. To address these issues, we introduce the Multimodal Intelligent
Retrieval and Augmentation (MIRA) framework, designed to optimize factual
accuracy in MLLM. MIRA consists of two key components: (1) a calibrated
Rethinking and Rearrangement module that dynamically adjusts the number of
retrieved contexts to manage factual risk, and (2) A medical RAG framework
integrating image embeddings and a medical knowledge base with a query-rewrite
module for efficient multimodal reasoning. This enables the model to
effectively integrate both its inherent knowledge and external references. Our
evaluation of publicly available medical VQA and report generation benchmarks
demonstrates that MIRA substantially enhances factual accuracy and overall
performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An embedded, unsupervised architecture for feature point detection and description is proposed, based on a quantized SuperPoint CNN, optimized for resource-limited platforms like FPGAs, achieving 54 fps on 640x480 images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate position estimation is crucial for navigation in autonomous systems, requiring efficient feature extraction methods for VSLAM.

Method: Quantized SuperPoint CNN implemented on an FPGA SoC (AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+), using Brevitas and FINN for optimization and quantisation.

Result: Achieved 54 fps on 640x480 images, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions, with experiments on the TUM dataset validating performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method efficiently balances computational demands and detection quality, enabling high-performance VSLAM on resource-limited platforms.

Abstract: Accurate position estimation is essential for modern navigation systems
deployed in autonomous platforms, including ground vehicles, marine vessels,
and aerial drones. In this context, Visual Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping (VSLAM) - which includes Visual Odometry - relies heavily on the
reliable extraction of salient feature points from the visual input data. In
this work, we propose an embedded implementation of an unsupervised
architecture capable of detecting and describing feature points. It is based on
a quantised SuperPoint convolutional neural network. Our objective is to
minimise the computational demands of the model while preserving high detection
quality, thus facilitating efficient deployment on platforms with limited
resources, such as mobile or embedded systems. We implemented the solution on
an FPGA System-on-Chip (SoC) platform, specifically the AMD/Xilinx Zynq
UltraScale+, where we evaluated the performance of Deep Learning Processing
Units (DPUs) and we also used the Brevitas library and the FINN framework to
perform model quantisation and hardware-aware optimisation. This allowed us to
process 640 x 480 pixel images at up to 54 fps on an FPGA platform,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in the field. We conducted experiments
on the TUM dataset to demonstrate and discuss the impact of different
quantisation techniques on the accuracy and performance of the model in a
visual odometry task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy called CiCi is proposed for rPPG tasks, leveraging spatio-temporal consistency and inconsistency in signals to enhance real-time adaptation without source data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing limitations of existing rPPG models in real-world deployment due to privacy concerns and real-time adaptation challenges.

Method: Introduces the CiCi framework, combining consistency and inconsistency priors in rPPG signals, with a gradient dynamic control mechanism for stable adaptation.

Result: Outperforms existing techniques on five datasets under TTA protocol, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The CiCi framework effectively enhances real-time self-supervised adaptation for rPPG tasks without needing source data.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as a promising non-invasive
method for monitoring physiological signals using the camera. Although various
domain adaptation and generalization methods were proposed to promote the
adaptability of deep-based rPPG models in unseen deployment environments,
considerations in aspects like privacy concerns and real-time adaptation
restrict their application in real-world deployment. Thus, we aim to propose a
novel fully Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) strategy tailored for rPPG tasks in this
work. Specifically, based on prior knowledge in physiology and our
observations, we noticed not only there is spatio-temporal consistency in the
frequency domain of rPPG signals, but also that inconsistency in the time
domain was significant. Given this, by leveraging both consistency and
inconsistency priors, we introduce an innovative expert knowledge-based
self-supervised
\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}n\textbf{C}onsistency-\textbf{i}ntegration
(\textbf{CiCi}) framework to enhances model adaptation during inference.
Besides, our approach further incorporates a gradient dynamic control mechanism
to mitigate potential conflicts between priors, ensuring stable adaptation
across instances. Through extensive experiments on five diverse datasets under
the TTA protocol, our method consistently outperforms existing techniques,
presenting state-of-the-art performance in real-time self-supervised adaptation
without accessing source data. The code will be released later.

TL;DR: A real-time ID algorithm for mice in home cages improves tracking accuracy and reduces ID switches by combining custom ear tags, a multiple object tracker, a transformer-based ID classifier, and a tracklet associator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated monitoring of laboratory mice enhances data accuracy and animal welfare, but individual identification is challenging due to housing density and similar appearances.

Method: Developed a pipeline with MouseTracks (tracker), Mouseformer (ID classifier), and MouseMap (tracklet associator) to assign IDs based on ear tags at 30 fps.

Result: The pipeline improves tracking efficiency and reduces ID switches across mouse strains and environments compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed system enables accurate, real-time monitoring of mice, benefiting research and animal welfare.

Abstract: Continuous, automated monitoring of laboratory mice enables more accurate
data collection and improves animal welfare through real-time insights.
Researchers can achieve a more dynamic and clinically relevant characterization
of disease progression and therapeutic effects by integrating behavioral and
physiological monitoring in the home cage. However, providing individual mouse
metrics is difficult because of their housing density, similar appearances,
high mobility, and frequent interactions. To address these challenges, we
develop a real-time identification (ID) algorithm that accurately assigns ID
predictions to mice wearing custom ear tags in digital home cages monitored by
cameras. Our pipeline consists of three parts: (1) a custom multiple object
tracker (MouseTracks) that combines appearance and motion cues from mice; (2) a
transformer-based ID classifier (Mouseformer); and (3) a tracklet associator
linear program to assign final ID predictions to tracklets (MouseMap). Our
models assign an animal ID based on custom ear tags at 30 frames per second
with 24/7 cage coverage. We show that our custom tracking and ID pipeline
improves tracking efficiency and lowers ID switches across mouse strains and
various environmental factors compared to current mouse tracking methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the domain gap between Martian and terrestrial imagery necessitate a specialized solution for mission rehearsal and robotic simulation.

Method: Proposes M3arsSynth for 3D environment reconstruction from NASA's PDS stereo images and MarsGen for video synthesis, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data.

Result: Achieves superior visual fidelity and 3D structural consistency compared to terrestrial-trained models.

Conclusion: The holistic solution effectively addresses Martian video synthesis challenges, enabling realistic and geometrically consistent outputs.

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic Martian landscape videos is crucial for mission
rehearsal and robotic simulation. However, this task poses unique challenges
due to the scarcity of high-quality Martian data and the significant domain gap
between Martian and terrestrial imagery. To address these challenges, we
propose a holistic solution composed of two key components: 1) A data curation
pipeline Multimodal Mars Synthesis (M3arsSynth), which reconstructs 3D Martian
environments from real stereo navigation images, sourced from NASA's Planetary
Data System (PDS), and renders high-fidelity multiview 3D video sequences. 2) A
Martian terrain video generator, MarsGen, which synthesizes novel videos
visually realistic and geometrically consistent with the 3D structure encoded
in the data. Our M3arsSynth engine spans a wide range of Martian terrains and
acquisition dates, enabling the generation of physically accurate 3D surface
models at metric-scale resolution. MarsGen, fine-tuned on M3arsSynth data,
synthesizes videos conditioned on an initial image frame and, optionally,
camera trajectories or textual prompts, allowing for video generation in novel
environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms video
synthesis models trained on terrestrial datasets, achieving superior visual
fidelity and 3D structural consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geometry Forcing improves video diffusion models by aligning intermediate representations with pretrained geometric features, enhancing 3D consistency and visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models often lack geometric-aware structure, failing to capture the 3D nature of the physical world.

Method: Proposes Geometry Forcing with Angular and Scale Alignment objectives to align diffusion representations with geometric features.

Result: Substantial improvement in visual quality and 3D consistency over baselines in view- and action-conditioned video generation.

Conclusion: Geometry Forcing effectively bridges the gap between video diffusion models and 3D world representations.

Abstract: Videos inherently represent 2D projections of a dynamic 3D world. However,
our analysis suggests that video diffusion models trained solely on raw video
data often fail to capture meaningful geometric-aware structure in their
learned representations. To bridge this gap between video diffusion models and
the underlying 3D nature of the physical world, we propose Geometry Forcing, a
simple yet effective method that encourages video diffusion models to
internalize latent 3D representations. Our key insight is to guide the model's
intermediate representations toward geometry-aware structure by aligning them
with features from a pretrained geometric foundation model. To this end, we
introduce two complementary alignment objectives: Angular Alignment, which
enforces directional consistency via cosine similarity, and Scale Alignment,
which preserves scale-related information by regressing unnormalized geometric
features from normalized diffusion representation. We evaluate Geometry Forcing
on both camera view-conditioned and action-conditioned video generation tasks.

### [135] [OST-Bench: Evaluating the Capabilities of MLLMs in Online Spatio-temporal Scene Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07984)
*JingLi Lin,Chenming Zhu,Runsen Xu,Xiaohan Mao,Xihui Liu,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OST-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating Online Spatio-Temporal understanding in MLLMs, highlighting challenges in dynamic reasoning and memory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack evaluation of real-world embodied perception, focusing on offline settings. OST-Bench addresses this gap by testing online, incremental reasoning.

Method: OST-Bench uses 1.4k scenes and 10k QA pairs from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes to evaluate MLLMs under online exploration settings.

Result: Leading MLLMs perform poorly on complex spatio-temporal tasks, with accuracy declining as exploration and memory demands increase.

Conclusion: OST-Bench reveals key challenges in online embodied reasoning, emphasizing the need for improved memory and spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown
remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex
reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline
settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a
benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the
perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect
emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired
observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current
visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning.
OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception.
Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k
scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and
ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that
they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the
online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and
the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common
error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial
reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly
drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core
challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To
foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and
benchmark are available. Our project page is:

### [136] [CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985)
*Bijay Gurung,David T. Hoffmann,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper investigates why CLIP models struggle with binding (e.g., distinguishing object-attribute pairs) and identifies data properties as the key issue, not batch size or hard negatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP models fail at binding tasks (e.g., mixing object colors), and prior fixes like hard negatives or architecture changes didn't fully resolve the issue. The authors suspect data properties are the root cause.

Method: They analyze CLIP's binding performance using a synthetic dataset, focusing on data properties like attribute density, caption completeness, and saliency bias.

Result: Natural data properties (low attribute density, incomplete captions, saliency bias) harm binding. Scaling batch size or adding hard negatives doesn't help; only data with specific properties enables reliable binding.

Conclusion: Data properties, not training tricks, are critical for CLIP to learn binding. Addressing these properties can improve CLIP's performance on binding tasks.

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of
applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for
multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major
limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and,
as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow
submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous
attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the
architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect
that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in
the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this
work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data
properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We
find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density,
incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to
describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on
binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling
the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly
creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the
data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect
binding.

*Jeongseok Hyun,Sukjun Hwang,Su Ho Han,Taeoh Kim,Inwoong Lee,Dongyoon Wee,Joon-Young Lee,Seon Joo Kim,Minho Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STTM is a training-free spatio-temporal token merging method for video LLMs, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy by exploiting local redundancy in video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs face quadratic computational scaling with token count, limiting efficiency. STTM addresses this by leveraging overlooked spatial and temporal redundancy.

Method: STTM transforms frames into multi-granular spatial tokens via quadtree search, then merges tokens temporally. It is query-agnostic, enabling KV cache reuse.

Result: STTM achieves 2× speed-up with 0.5% accuracy drop (50% token budget) and 3× speed-up with 2% drop (30% budget), outperforming existing methods on six benchmarks.

Conclusion: STTM efficiently reduces computational cost in video LLMs by merging tokens, maintaining high accuracy and enabling practical speed-ups.

Abstract: Video large language models (LLMs) achieve strong video understanding by
leveraging a large number of spatio-temporal tokens, but suffer from quadratic
computational scaling with token count. To address this, we propose a
training-free spatio-temporal token merging method, named STTM. Our key insight
is to exploit local spatial and temporal redundancy in video data which has
been overlooked in prior work. STTM first transforms each frame into
multi-granular spatial tokens using a coarse-to-fine search over a quadtree
structure, then performs directed pairwise merging across the temporal
dimension. This decomposed merging approach outperforms existing token
reduction methods across six video QA benchmarks. Notably, STTM achieves a
2$\times$ speed-up with only a 0.5% accuracy drop under a 50% token budget, and
a 3$\times$ speed-up with just a 2% drop under a 30% budget. Moreover, STTM is
query-agnostic, allowing KV cache reuse across different questions for the same
video. The project page is available at https://www.jshyun.me/projects/sttm.

*Weihao Xia,Cengiz Oztireli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BASIC is a unified, multigranular evaluation framework for brain visual decoding, addressing limitations of coarse metrics by quantifying structural fidelity, inferential alignment, and contextual coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding rely on coarse metrics, lack neuroscientific foundation, and miss fine-grained distinctions, prompting the need for a more comprehensive framework.

Method: BASIC introduces hierarchical segmentation-based metrics for structural fidelity and uses multimodal large language models for semantic-level comparisons, benchmarking diverse visual decoding methods.

Result: The framework provides discriminative, interpretable, and comprehensive evaluation of brain visual decoding methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: BASIC offers a more refined and neuroscientifically grounded approach to evaluating visual decoding methods, enhancing interpretability and granularity.

Abstract: Existing evaluation protocols for brain visual decoding predominantly rely on
coarse metrics that obscure inter-model differences, lack neuroscientific
foundation, and fail to capture fine-grained visual distinctions. To address
these limitations, we introduce BASIC, a unified, multigranular evaluation
framework that jointly quantifies structural fidelity, inferential alignment,
and contextual coherence between decoded and ground truth images. For the
structural level, we introduce a hierarchical suite of segmentation-based
metrics, including foreground, semantic, instance, and component masks,
anchored in granularity-aware correspondence across mask structures. For the
semantic level, we extract structured scene representations encompassing
objects, attributes, and relationships using multimodal large language models,
enabling detailed, scalable, and context-rich comparisons with ground-truth
stimuli. We benchmark a diverse set of visual decoding methods across multiple
stimulus-neuroimaging datasets within this unified evaluation framework.
Together, these criteria provide a more discriminative, interpretable, and
comprehensive foundation for measuring brain visual decoding methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for few-shot keypoint detection using sketches, overcoming cross-modal and style challenges with prototypical methods and domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the lack of source data in few-shot keypoint detection by using sketches as a source-free alternative.

Method: Combines a prototypical setup, grid-based locator, and prototypical domain adaptation.

Result: Successful few-shot convergence across novel keypoints and classes.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages sketches for keypoint detection in few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Keypoint detection, integral to modern machine perception, faces challenges
in few-shot learning, particularly when source data from the same distribution
as the query is unavailable. This gap is addressed by leveraging sketches, a
popular form of human expression, providing a source-free alternative. However,
challenges arise in mastering cross-modal embeddings and handling user-specific
sketch styles. Our proposed framework overcomes these hurdles with a
prototypical setup, combined with a grid-based locator and prototypical domain
adaptation. We also demonstrate success in few-shot convergence across novel
keypoints and classes through extensive experiments.

*Shivam Duggal,Sanghyun Byun,William T. Freeman,Antonio Torralba,Phillip Isola*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KARL is a single-pass adaptive tokenizer inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity, predicting token counts for images efficiently while matching performance of multi-pass methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-length representations in visual learning ignore complexity variations. KARL addresses this by adapting token length based on image complexity, inspired by Algorithmic Information Theory.

Method: KARL predicts token counts in a single forward pass, halting when approximate Kolmogorov Complexity is reached. It uses a training procedure similar to Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning.

Result: KARL matches adaptive tokenizers' performance in a single pass, with scaling laws analyzed for encoder/decoder size and tokenization types.

Conclusion: KARL aligns with human intuition on image complexity, bridging adaptive tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory.

Abstract: According to Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT) -- Intelligent
representations compress data into the shortest possible program that can
reconstruct its content, exhibiting low Kolmogorov Complexity (KC). In
contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length
representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or
familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating
variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over
multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov
Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which
predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward
pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a
proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely
resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to
conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality.
KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a
single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of
encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more.
Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive
Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted
image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs.
out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.

TL;DR: The paper introduces \NickName, a method to enhance VQ-VAEs by improving codebook representation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the performance gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs by minimizing information loss and optimizing codebooks.

Method: Retains latent dimensions and uses sub-codebooks for quantization, evaluated on 512p and 2k zero-shot benchmarks.

Result: \NickName outperforms existing methods, achieving superior rFID (0.49 vs. 0.91) on ImageNet and better PSNR on zero-shot benchmarks.

Conclusion: \NickName sets a new standard for VQ-VAEs in high-fidelity image reconstruction, with potential for HD image processing.

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are fundamental models
that compress continuous visual data into discrete tokens. Existing methods
have tried to improve the quantization strategy for better reconstruction
quality, however, there still exists a large gap between VQ-VAEs and VAEs. To
narrow this gap, we propose \NickName, a novel method to augment the
representation capability of discrete codebooks, facilitating easier
optimization for codebooks and minimizing information loss, thereby enhancing
reconstruction quality. Specifically, we propose to retain the latent dimension
to preserve encoded features and incorporate a set of sub-codebooks for
quantization. Furthermore, we construct comprehensive zero-shot benchmarks
featuring resolutions of 512p and 2k to evaluate the reconstruction performance
of existing methods rigorously. \NickName~achieves the \textbf{state-of-the-art
performance on both ImageNet and $8$ zero-shot benchmarks} across all VQ-VAEs.
Notably, compared with SD-VAE, we outperform them on ImageNet significantly,
with rFID $\textbf{0.49}$ v.s. $\textbf{0.91}$, and achieve superior PSNR on
all zero-shot benchmarks. These results highlight the superiority of
\NickName~in reconstruction and pave the way for preserving fidelity in HD
image processing tasks. Code will be publicly available at

*Helen Qu,Sang Michael Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores how word co-occurrence statistics in CLIP/LMM pretraining data affect compositional generalization, showing strong correlations between PMI and model accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the impact of concept combinations in training data on CLIP/LMM performance, particularly for uncommon pairings.

Method: Uses PMI to measure co-occurrence, tests with synthetic and edited natural images, and evaluates CLIP/LMM performance.

Result: Strong correlation between PMI and accuracy (r=0.97 for CLIP), with similar effects in LMMs (r=0.70 for TextVQA).

Conclusion: Highlights the need for better algorithms to improve compositional generalization without scaling training data combinatorially.

Abstract: CLIP and large multimodal models (LMMs) have better accuracy on examples
involving concepts that are highly represented in the training data. However,
the role of concept combinations in the training data on compositional
generalization is largely unclear -- for instance, how does accuracy vary when
a common object appears in an uncommon pairing with another object? In this
paper, we investigate how word co-occurrence statistics in the pretraining
dataset (a proxy for co-occurrence of visual concepts) impacts CLIP/LMM
performance. To disentangle the effects of word co-occurrence frequencies from
single-word frequencies, we measure co-occurrence with pointwise mutual
information (PMI), which normalizes the joint probability of two words
co-occurring by the probability of co-occurring independently. Using
synthetically generated images with a variety of concept pairs, we show a
strong correlation between PMI in the CLIP pretraining data and zero-shot
accuracy in CLIP models trained on LAION-400M (r=0.97 and 14% accuracy gap
between images in the top and bottom 5% of PMI values), demonstrating that even
accuracy on common concepts is affected by the combination of concepts in the
image. Leveraging this finding, we reproduce this effect in natural images by
editing them to contain pairs with varying PMI, resulting in a correlation of
r=0.75. Finally, we demonstrate that this behavior in CLIP transfers to LMMs
built on top of CLIP (r=0.70 for TextVQA, r=0.62 for VQAv2). Our findings
highlight the need for algorithms and architectures that improve compositional
generalization in multimodal models without scaling the training data
combinatorially. Our code is available at

### [143] [A Language-Driven Framework for Improving Personalized Recommendations: Merging LLMs with Traditional Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07251)
*Aaron Goldstein,Ayan Dutta*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: The paper proposes an LLM-enhanced framework for personalized movie recommendations, combining traditional algorithms with text-based user preferences, outperforming SVD and SVD++ in metrics like hit rate and NDCG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional recommendation algorithms lack personalization for text-based user preferences, prompting the use of LLMs to mimic human-like recommendations.

Method: Leverages LLMs to refine SVD/SVD++ outputs from the MovieLens dataset, using automated or manual preference profiles, and evaluates performance with hit rates and ranking metrics.

Result: The framework significantly outperforms SVD/SVD++ (e.g., ~6x higher cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x NDCG) despite slight computational overhead.

Conclusion: LLM-enhanced recommendation systems offer superior personalization and performance, though with increased computational cost.

Abstract: Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide
personalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,
e.g., "I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor". Large Language
Models (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural
language processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework
that mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge
of an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation
systems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with
language-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,
implemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the
MovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base
algorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit
rates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our
framework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use
rating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test
split. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on
users' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more
personalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly
surpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of
up to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a
slight increase in computational overhead.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SD-GS is a dynamic Gaussian splatting framework that reduces storage costs and improves motion modeling for complex scenes using a deformable anchor grid and deformation-aware densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the trade-off between storage costs and motion modeling in current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction.

Method: Introduces a deformable anchor grid for efficient scene representation and a deformation-aware densification strategy for adaptive anchor growth.

Result: Achieves 60% reduction in model size and 100% improvement in FPS compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SD-GS enhances computational efficiency and visual quality for dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Current 4D Gaussian frameworks for dynamic scene reconstruction deliver
impressive visual fidelity and rendering speed, however, the inherent trade-off
between storage costs and the ability to characterize complex physical motions
significantly limits the practical application of these methods. To tackle
these problems, we propose SD-GS, a compact and efficient dynamic Gaussian
splatting framework for complex dynamic scene reconstruction, featuring two key
contributions. First, we introduce a deformable anchor grid, a hierarchical and
memory-efficient scene representation where each anchor point derives multiple
3D Gaussians in its local spatiotemporal region and serves as the geometric
backbone of the 3D scene. Second, to enhance modeling capability for complex
motions, we present a deformation-aware densification strategy that adaptively
grows anchors in under-reconstructed high-dynamic regions while reducing
redundancy in static areas, achieving superior visual quality with fewer
anchors. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art
methods, SD-GS achieves an average of 60\% reduction in model size and an
average of 100\% improvement in FPS, significantly enhancing computational
efficiency while maintaining or even surpassing visual quality.

TL;DR: The paper addresses challenges in matting algorithms for capture stage content, proposing insights, guidelines, and an efficient pipeline for improved workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing matting algorithms struggle with capture stage content, necessitating better solutions for high-end recordings.

Method: The authors analyze challenges, propose guidelines, and demonstrate an efficient pipeline for adapting state-of-the-art approaches without extensive annotations.

Result: A validation methodology using a diffusion model shows the benefits of their approach.

Conclusion: The work provides practical insights and solutions to improve matting for capture stage content.

Abstract: Capture stages are high-end sources of state-of-the-art recordings for
downstream applications in movies, games, and other media. One crucial step in
almost all pipelines is the matting of images to isolate the captured
performances from the background. While common matting algorithms deliver
remarkable performance in other applications like teleconferencing and mobile
entertainment, we found that they struggle significantly with the peculiarities
of capture stage content. The goal of our work is to share insights into those
challenges as a curated list of those characteristics along with a constructive
discussion for proactive intervention and present a guideline to practitioners
for an improved workflow to mitigate unresolved challenges. To this end, we
also demonstrate an efficient pipeline to adapt state-of-the-art approaches to
such custom setups without the need of extensive annotations, both offline and
real-time. For an objective evaluation, we propose a validation methodology
based on a leading diffusion model that highlights the benefits of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rendering reflective objects in 3DGS is challenging, especially for inverse rendering and relighting. Existing methods struggle with high-frequency details and artifacts.

Method: Uses a hybrid rendering model combining forward and deferred rendering to recover geometry and separate appearances. Includes a physically-based deferred rendering branch for BRDF and lighting decomposition.

Result: Improves novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and relighting while maintaining efficiency.

Conclusion: RTR-GS effectively addresses challenges in rendering reflective objects and enhances performance in inverse rendering tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
novel view synthesis. However, rendering reflective objects remains a
significant challenge, particularly in inverse rendering and relighting. We
introduce RTR-GS, a novel inverse rendering framework capable of robustly
rendering objects with arbitrary reflectance properties, decomposing BRDF and
lighting, and delivering credible relighting results. Given a collection of
multi-view images, our method effectively recovers geometric structure through
a hybrid rendering model that combines forward rendering for radiance transfer
with deferred rendering for reflections. This approach successfully separates
high-frequency and low-frequency appearances, mitigating floating artifacts
caused by spherical harmonic overfitting when handling high-frequency details.
We further refine BRDF and lighting decomposition using an additional
physically-based deferred rendering branch. Experimental results show that our
method enhances novel view synthesis, normal estimation, decomposition, and
relighting while maintaining efficient training inference process.

TL;DR: Proposes input-driven layer dropping (LD) for dynamic speech models in edge/IoT, outperforming random dropping and matching early exit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing layer dropping methods in dynamic architectures for resource-varying edge/IoT settings.

Method: Uses input features and a lightweight layer selector to optimize layer combinations during inference.

Result: Outperforms random dropping and matches early exit on 4 speech/audio benchmarks.

Conclusion: Input-driven LD effectively transforms static models into dynamic ones with minimal architecture changes.

Abstract: Curating foundation speech models for edge and IoT settings, where
computational resources vary over time, requires dynamic architectures
featuring adaptable reduction strategies. One emerging approach is layer
dropping ($\mathcal{LD}$) which skips fraction of the layers of a backbone
network during inference to reduce the computational load. This allows
transforming static models into dynamic ones. However, existing approaches
exhibit limitations either in the mode of selecting layers or by significantly
modifying the neural architecture. To this end, we propose input-driven
$\mathcal{LD}$ that employs the network's input features and a lightweight
layer selecting network to determine the optimum combination of processing
layers. Extensive experimentation on 4 speech and audio public benchmarks,
using two different pre-trained foundation models, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our approach, thoroughly outperforming random dropping and
producing on-par (or better) results to early exit.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ASE_Res_UNet, an advanced deep learning model for segmenting curvilinear structures in noisy fluorescence microscopy images, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmenting curvilinear structures in noisy or low-contrast fluorescence microscopy images is challenging, especially in dense filament networks.

Method: Developed ASE_Res_UNet by enhancing U-Net with residual blocks and adaptive SE attention mechanisms. Evaluated using synthetic datasets mimicking real microscopy images.

Result: ASE_Res_UNet outperformed variants and state-of-the-art models, excelling in noise resilience and detecting low-intensity structures.

Conclusion: ASE_Res_UNet generalizes well to real microscopy images and other curvilinear structures, showing promise for disease diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Segmenting curvilinear structures in fluorescence microscopy remains a
challenging task, particularly under noisy conditions and in dense filament
networks commonly seen in vivo. To address this, we created two original
datasets consisting of hundreds of synthetic images of fluorescently labelled
microtubules within cells. These datasets are precisely annotated and closely
mimic real microscopy images, including realistic noise. The second dataset
presents an additional challenge, by simulating varying fluorescence
intensities along filaments that complicate segmentation. While deep learning
has shown strong potential in biomedical image analysis, its performance often
declines in noisy or low-contrast conditions. To overcome this limitation, we
developed a novel advanced architecture: the Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation
Residual U-Net (ASE_Res_UNet). This model enhanced the standard U-Net by
integrating residual blocks in the encoder and adaptive SE attention mechanisms
in the decoder. Through ablation studies and comprehensive visual and
quantitative evaluations, ASE_Res_UNet consistently outperformed its variants,
namely standard U-Net, ASE_UNet and Res_UNet architectures. These improvements,
particularly in noise resilience and detecting fine, low-intensity structures,
were largely attributed to the adaptive SE attention module that we created. We
further benchmarked ASE_Res_UNet against various state-of-the-art models, and
found it achieved superior performance on our most challenging dataset.
Finally, the model also generalized well to real microscopy images of stained
microtubules as well as to other curvilinear structures. Indeed, it
successfully segmented retinal blood vessels and nerves in noisy or
low-contrast biomedical images, demonstrating its strong potential for
applications in disease diagnosis and treatment.

TL;DR: A novel framework for extracting crowd motion patterns and semantics using mmWave radar, combining signal processing, graph theory, and flow analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for high-fidelity extraction of crowd motion patterns and semantics using mmWave radar, addressing challenges in complex crowd scenarios.

Method: Proposes a signal processing pipeline for mmWave flow fields, transforms them into directed geometric graphs, and analyzes local Jacobian, curl, and divergence for semantics.

Result: Achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction and accurate inference of crowd semantics (e.g., turns, boundaries, dispersions) in experiments with up to 20 people.

Conclusion: Validates the framework's effectiveness for crowd analytics, demonstrating potential for diverse applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for extracting underlying crowd
motion patterns and inferring crowd semantics using mmWave radar. First, our
proposed signal processing pipeline combines optical flow estimation concepts
from vision with novel statistical and morphological noise filtering to
generate high-fidelity mmWave flow fields - compact 2D vector representations
of crowd motion. We then introduce a novel approach that transforms these
fields into directed geometric graphs, where edges capture dominant flow
currents, vertices mark crowd splitting or merging, and flow distribution is
quantified across edges. Finally, we show that by analyzing the local Jacobian
and computing the corresponding curl and divergence, we can extract key crowd
semantics for both structured and diffused crowds. We conduct 21 experiments on
crowds of up to (and including) 20 people across 3 areas, using commodity
mmWave radar. Our framework achieves high-fidelity graph reconstruction of the
underlying flow structure, even for complex crowd patterns, demonstrating
strong spatial alignment and precise quantitative characterization of flow
split ratios. Finally, our curl and divergence analysis accurately infers key
crowd semantics, e.g., abrupt turns, boundaries where flow directions shift,
dispersions, and gatherings. Overall, these findings validate our framework,
underscoring its potential for various crowd analytics applications.

### [150] [LangNavBench: Evaluation of Natural Language Understanding in Semantic Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07299)
*Sonia Raychaudhuri,Enrico Cancelli,Tommaso Campari,Lamberto Ballan,Manolis Savva,Angel X. Chang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LangNav introduces a language-focused benchmark for semantic navigation, testing agents' ability to ground instructions. LangNavBench evaluates models on attributes, spatial cues, and hierarchies. MLFM, a new method, outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack a clear, language-centric evaluation for semantic navigation, limiting understanding of how agents ground instructions.

Method: LangNav is a manually verified dataset for testing object descriptions at varying detail levels. LangNavBench benchmarks models on language understanding. MLFM, a multi-layered semantic map method, is proposed.

Result: LangNav has lower error rates than existing datasets. MLFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on LangNav.

Conclusion: LangNav and LangNavBench provide a thorough language-centric evaluation, with MLFM showing superior performance in semantic navigation.

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in
language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target
object described in natural language. Despite these advances, we still lack a
clear, language-focused benchmark for testing how well such agents ground the
words in their instructions. We address this gap with LangNav, an open-set
dataset specifically created to test an agent's ability to locate objects
described at different levels of detail, from broad category names to fine
attributes and object-object relations. Every description in LangNav was
manually checked, yielding a lower error rate than existing lifelong- and
semantic-navigation datasets. On top of LangNav we build LangNavBench, a
benchmark that measures how well current semantic-navigation methods understand
and act on these descriptions while moving toward their targets. LangNavBench
allows us to systematically compare models on their handling of attributes,
spatial and relational cues, and category hierarchies, offering the first
thorough, language-centric evaluation of embodied navigation systems. We also
present Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a method that builds a queryable
multi-layered semantic map, particularly effective when dealing with small
objects or instructions involving spatial relations. MLFM outperforms
state-of-the-art mapping-based navigation baselines on the LangNav dataset.

*Nishit V. Pandya,Andrey Labunets,Sicun Gao,Earlence Fernandes*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper evaluates the robustness of prompt injection defenses in LLMs, demonstrating their vulnerability to optimization-based attacks, with success rates up to 70%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the effectiveness of existing defenses against prompt injection attacks in LLMs, particularly in whitebox settings.

Method: Constructs a novel attention-based attack algorithm and tests it on two recent defenses (SecAlign and StruQ).

Result: Shows defenses fail under strong attacks, with success rates up to 70% and modest token budget increases.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for more robust defenses against prompt injection in LLMs.

Abstract: A popular class of defenses against prompt injection attacks on large
language models (LLMs) relies on fine-tuning the model to separate instructions
and data, so that the LLM does not follow instructions that might be present
with data. There are several academic systems and production-level
implementations of this idea. We evaluate the robustness of this class of
prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting by constructing strong
optimization-based attacks and showing that the defenses do not provide the
claimed security properties. Specifically, we construct a novel attention-based
attack algorithm for text-based LLMs and apply it to two recent whitebox
defenses SecAlign (CCS 2025) and StruQ (USENIX Security 2025), showing attacks
with success rates of up to 70% with modest increase in attacker budget in
terms of tokens. Our findings make fundamental progress towards understanding
the robustness of prompt injection defenses in the whitebox setting. We release
our code and attacks at https://github.com/nishitvp/better_opts_attacks

TL;DR: The paper investigates electromagnetic signal injection attacks on CMOS image sensors, revealing rainbow-like artifacts that disrupt object detection models, exposing a critical vulnerability in visual perception systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image sensors are crucial for safety- and security-critical systems, but their analog domain is vulnerable to undetected manipulation, posing risks to decision-making processes.

Method: The study explores electromagnetic interference attacks on CMOS image sensors, analyzing induced color artifacts and their impact on object detection models.

Result: The attacks cause rainbow-like artifacts that propagate through processing pipelines, leading to significant mispredictions in object detection models.

Conclusion: The findings expose a critical vulnerability in visual perception systems, emphasizing the need for robust defenses against physical-layer attacks.

Abstract: Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical
systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and
industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to
make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic
signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors,
allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering
conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented
attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced
in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic
interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on
state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts
propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant
mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored
vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more
robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based translation agents are limited to text-only inputs, missing out on valuable visual and contextual cues that human translators use.

Method: ViDove integrates multimodal memory and long-short term memory modules with domain-specific knowledge, inspired by human translators' workflow.

Result: ViDove achieves a 28% improvement in BLEU scores and 15% in SubER, excelling in subtitle generation and general translation tasks.

Conclusion: ViDove demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal inputs in translation, introducing DoveBench as a new benchmark for long-form video subtitling and translation.

Abstract: LLM-based translation agents have achieved highly human-like translation
results and are capable of handling longer and more complex contexts with
greater efficiency. However, they are typically limited to text-only inputs. In
this paper, we introduce ViDove, a translation agent system designed for
multimodal input. Inspired by the workflow of human translators, ViDove
leverages visual and contextual background information to enhance the
translation process. Additionally, we integrate a multimodal memory system and
long-short term memory modules enriched with domain-specific knowledge,
enabling the agent to perform more accurately and adaptively in real-world
scenarios. As a result, ViDove achieves significantly higher translation
quality in both subtitle generation and general translation tasks, with a 28%
improvement in BLEU scores and a 15% improvement in SubER compared to previous
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, we introduce DoveBench, a new benchmark
for long-form automatic video subtitling and translation, featuring 17 hours of
high-quality, human-annotated data. Our code is available here:

### [155] [Growing Transformers: Modular Composition and Layer-wise Expansion on a Frozen Substrate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07129)
*A. Bochkov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a constructive approach to scaling LLMs using non-trainable embeddings, enabling modular composition and layer-wise growth for efficient and flexible model development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the resource-intensive and inflexible nature of monolithic LLM training by exploring alternative, scalable methods.

Method: Uses fixed embeddings as a universal docking port for modular composition (merging specialist models) and progressive layer-wise growth (stacking layers incrementally).

Result: Merged MoE models show improved performance without forgetting, and layer-wise growth demonstrates stable convergence and depth-correlated reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: Suggests a shift towards biological-like, incremental AI development, enabling resource-efficient scaling and democratized AI ecosystem.

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for scaling large language models (LLMs) involves
monolithic, end-to-end training, a resource-intensive process that lacks
flexibility. This paper explores an alternative, constructive approach to model
development, built upon the foundation of non-trainable, deterministic input
embeddings. In prior [1], we established that high-level semantic reasoning can
emerge in Transformers using frozen embeddings derived from the visual
structure of Unicode glyphs. Here, we demonstrate that this fixed
representational substrate acts as a universal "docking port," enabling two
powerful and efficient scaling paradigms: seamless modular composition and
progressive layer-wise growth.
  First, we show that specialist models trained on disparate datasets (e.g.,
Russian and Chinese text) can be merged into a single, more capable
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, post-training, with zero architectural
modification. This is achieved by simply averaging their output logits. The
resulting MoE model exhibits immediate performance improvements on reasoning
benchmarks like MMLU, surpassing its constituent experts without catastrophic
forgetting. Second, we introduce a layer-wise constructive training
methodology, where a deep Transformer is "grown" by progressively stacking and
training one layer at a time. This method demonstrates stable convergence and a
clear correlation between model depth and the emergence of complex reasoning
abilities, such as those required for SQuAD.
  Our findings suggest a paradigm shift from monolithic optimization towards a
more biological or constructive model of AI development, where complexity is
built incrementally and modules can be composed freely. This opens new avenues
for resource-efficient scaling, continual learning, and a more democratized
ecosystem for building powerful AI systems. We release all code and models to
facilitate further research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MUSE improves LLM uncertainty quantification by aggregating diverse model outputs using Jensen-Shannon Divergence, outperforming single-model and naive ensemble methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show inconsistent behavior, highlighting the need for better uncertainty quantification, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: Proposes MUSE, which uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs.

Result: Experiments show MUSE enhances calibration and predictive performance over baselines.

Conclusion: Model diversity and MUSE's aggregation method improve uncertainty estimates in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often behave inconsistently across inputs,
indicating uncertainty and motivating the need for its quantification in
high-stakes settings. Prior work on calibration and uncertainty quantification
often focuses on individual models, overlooking the potential of model
diversity. We hypothesize that LLMs make complementary predictions due to
differences in training and the Zipfian nature of language, and that
aggregating their outputs leads to more reliable uncertainty estimates. To
leverage this, we propose MUSE (Multi-LLM Uncertainty via Subset Ensembles), a
simple information-theoretic method that uses Jensen-Shannon Divergence to
identify and aggregate well-calibrated subsets of LLMs. Experiments on binary
prediction tasks demonstrate improved calibration and predictive performance
compared to single-model and naive ensemble baselines.

TL;DR: The paper addresses reward hacking in RLHF by proposing a unified reward modeling framework combining BT single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions, improving robustness and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF is vulnerable to reward hacking, especially in OOD settings, and existing methods struggle with multi-objective reward functions due to limited high-quality data.

Method: A unified framework jointly trains BT single-objective and multi-objective regression-based reward functions using a shared embedding space.

Result: The framework enhances robustness in OOD settings and improves scoring performance, with a 7B model outperforming a 70B baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively mitigates reward hacking and improves reward model performance, particularly in challenging OOD scenarios.

Abstract: Reward models trained on human preference data have demonstrated strong
effectiveness in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human intent under
the framework of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). However,
RLHF remains vulnerable to reward hacking, where the policy exploits
imperfections in the reward function rather than genuinely learning the
intended behavior. Although significant efforts have been made to mitigate
reward hacking, they predominantly focus on and evaluate in-distribution
scenarios, where the training and testing data for the reward model share the
same distribution. In this paper, we empirically show that state-of-the-art
methods struggle in more challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We
further demonstrate that incorporating fine-grained multi-attribute scores
helps address this challenge. However, the limited availability of high-quality
data often leads to weak performance of multi-objective reward functions, which
can negatively impact overall performance and become the bottleneck. To address
this issue, we propose a unified reward modeling framework that jointly trains
Bradley--Terry (BT) single-objective and multi-objective regression-based
reward functions using a shared embedding space. We theoretically establish a
connection between the BT loss and the regression objective and highlight their
complementary benefits. Specifically, the regression task enhances the
single-objective reward function's ability to mitigate reward hacking in
challenging OOD settings, while BT-based training improves the scoring
capability of the multi-objective reward function, enabling a 7B model to
outperform a 70B baseline. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves both the robustness and the scoring
performance of reward models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a stable, inversion-free framework for context-aware low-rank approximation in neural networks, addressing numerical instabilities in existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical instabilities due to reliance on explicit Gram matrix computation and inversion, degrading approximation quality.

Method: Introduces a novel inversion-free regularized framework based on stable decompositions, handling GPU memory limits, near-singular matrices, and insufficient data.

Result: The method overcomes numerical pitfalls, handles challenging scenarios, and provides convergence guarantees with explicit error bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves stability and reliability in context-aware low-rank approximation for neural networks.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that context-aware low-rank approximation is a useful
tool for compression and fine-tuning of modern large-scale neural networks. In
this type of approximation, a norm is weighted by a matrix of input
activations, significantly improving metrics over the unweighted case.
Nevertheless, existing methods for neural networks suffer from numerical
instabilities due to their reliance on classical formulas involving explicit
Gram matrix computation and their subsequent inversion. We demonstrate that
this can degrade the approximation quality or cause numerically singular
matrices.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel inversion-free regularized
framework that is based entirely on stable decompositions and overcomes the
numerical pitfalls of prior art. Our method can handle possible challenging
scenarios: (1) when calibration matrices exceed GPU memory capacity, (2) when
input activation matrices are nearly singular, and even (3) when insufficient
data prevents unique approximation. For the latter, we prove that our solution
converges to a desired approximation and derive explicit error bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a clustering mechanism for O*NET occupations using BERT-based techniques and dimensionality reduction to map varying definitions across firms/countries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occupational definitions vary across firms/countries, requiring a mapping mechanism for expanding O*NET data.

Method: Pipeline with BERT-based techniques, clustering approaches, and dimensionality reduction, optimized with a specialized silhouette approach.

Result: Improved clustering performance and automated occupation distinction, aiding career transitions.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable solution for mapping occupational definitions, benefiting career path analysis.

Abstract: In this study, we focused on proposing an optimal clustering mechanism for
the occupations defined in the well-known US-based occupational database,
O*NET. Even though all occupations are defined according to well-conducted
surveys in the US, their definitions can vary for different firms and
countries. Hence, if one wants to expand the data that is already collected in
O*NET for the occupations defined with different tasks, a map between the
definitions will be a vital requirement. We proposed a pipeline using several
BERT-based techniques with various clustering approaches to obtain such a map.
We also examined the effect of dimensionality reduction approaches on several
metrics used in measuring performance of clustering algorithms. Finally, we
improved our results by using a specialized silhouette approach. This new
clustering-based mapping approach with dimensionality reduction may help
distinguish the occupations automatically, creating new paths for people
wanting to change their careers.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GuardVal, a dynamic evaluation protocol for jailbreak attacks on LLMs, addressing gaps in current benchmarks and offering insights into model vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to fully assess LLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks, necessitating a more robust evaluation method.

Method: GuardVal dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's state, with an optimization method to prevent stagnation.

Result: Applied to models like Mistral-7b and GPT-4, GuardVal reveals distinct behavioral patterns and deeper vulnerabilities.

Conclusion: GuardVal provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLM robustness, informing future research and development of secure models.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks reveal critical vulnerabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) by causing them to generate harmful or unethical content. Evaluating
these threats is particularly challenging due to the evolving nature of LLMs
and the sophistication required in effectively probing their vulnerabilities.
Current benchmarks and evaluation methods struggle to fully address these
challenges, leaving gaps in the assessment of LLM vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we review existing jailbreak evaluation practices and identify three
assumed desiderata for an effective jailbreak evaluation protocol. To address
these challenges, we introduce GuardVal, a new evaluation protocol that
dynamically generates and refines jailbreak prompts based on the defender LLM's
state, providing a more accurate assessment of defender LLMs' capacity to
handle safety-critical situations. Moreover, we propose a new optimization
method that prevents stagnation during prompt refinement, ensuring the
generation of increasingly effective jailbreak prompts that expose deeper
weaknesses in the defender LLMs. We apply this protocol to a diverse set of
models, from Mistral-7b to GPT-4, across 10 safety domains. Our findings
highlight distinct behavioral patterns among the models, offering a
comprehensive view of their robustness. Furthermore, our evaluation process
deepens the understanding of LLM behavior, leading to insights that can inform
future research and drive the development of more secure models.

TL;DR: DeMul, a description-free multi-prompt learning method, directly distills LLM knowledge into prompts, outperforming existing methods on 11 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on unreliable text-based responses from LLMs for prompts, leading to variability and low reliability.

Method: DeMul eliminates description extraction, directly distilling LLM knowledge into continuous vector prompts and incorporating prompt weighting.

Result: Superior performance on 11 recognition datasets.

Conclusion: DeMul offers a more robust and effective approach for prompt learning in VLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLM) have shown
promising potential for effectively adapting to downstream tasks through prompt
learning, without the need for additional annotated paired datasets. To
supplement the text information in VLM trained on correlations with vision
data, new approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) in prompts have
been proposed, enhancing robustness to unseen and diverse data. Existing
methods typically extract text-based responses (i.e., descriptions) from LLM to
incorporate into prompts; however, this approach suffers from high variability
and low reliability. In this work, we propose Description-free Multi-prompt
Learning(DeMul), a novel method that eliminates the process of extracting
descriptions and instead directly distills knowledge from LLM into prompts. By
adopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics
while still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby
eliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates. Additionally, in a
multi-prompt setting, we empirically demonstrate the potential of prompt
weighting in reflecting the importance of different prompts during training.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior performance
across 11 recognition datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer, improves ice layer thickness estimation in radargrams by leveraging attention mechanisms, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate monitoring of ice layer thickness is vital for climate models and ice dynamics, but current methods lack robustness in handling noise and long-range dependencies.

Method: ST-GRIT uses inductive geometric graph learning for spatial features and separate temporal/spatial attention blocks to model dependencies.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Greenland ice sheet data with lower root mean-squared error.

Conclusion: ST-GRIT's attention mechanisms enhance noise handling and dependency capture, offering a superior approach for ice layer analysis.

Abstract: Understanding the thickness and variability of internal ice layers in radar
imagery is crucial for monitoring snow accumulation, assessing ice dynamics,
and reducing uncertainties in climate models. Radar sensors, capable of
penetrating ice, provide detailed radargram images of these internal layers. In
this work, we present ST-GRIT, a spatio-temporal graph transformer for ice
layer thickness, designed to process these radargrams and capture the
spatiotemporal relationships between shallow and deep ice layers. ST-GRIT
leverages an inductive geometric graph learning framework to extract local
spatial features as feature embeddings and employs a series of temporal and
spatial attention blocks separately to model long-range dependencies
effectively in both dimensions. Experimental evaluation on radargram data from
the Greenland ice sheet demonstrates that ST-GRIT consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods and other baseline graph neural networks by
achieving lower root mean-squared error. These results highlight the advantages
of self-attention mechanisms on graphs over pure graph neural networks,
including the ability to handle noise, avoid oversmoothing, and capture
long-range dependencies. Moreover, the use of separate spatial and temporal
attention blocks allows for distinct and robust learning of spatial
relationships and temporal patterns, providing a more comprehensive and
effective approach.

TL;DR: DTME-MTL improves multi-task learning by dynamically adapting token space to mitigate negative transfer, avoiding excessive parameter growth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative transfer in Multi-Task Learning (MTL) degrades performance due to conflicting objectives. Fixed transformer architectures limit adaptability.

Method: Proposes Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), which identifies gradient conflicts in token space and applies adaptive solutions without duplicating parameters.

Result: DTME-MTL consistently enhances multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: DTME-MTL offers a scalable and efficient solution for transformer-based MTL by operating in token space.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a
shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative
transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance.
While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their
fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic
network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they
directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic
Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any
transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces
overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying
adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate
negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely
in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter
growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves
multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable
and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

TL;DR: FedCBDR addresses class imbalance in Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) via balanced data replay and task-aware temperature scaling, improving accuracy by 2%-15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in FCIL limits performance due to uneven replay buffer sampling and task disparities.

Method: FedCBDR uses global coordination for balanced replay and task-aware temperature scaling to adjust logits.

Result: Achieves 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FedCBDR effectively mitigates class imbalance in FCIL, enhancing model generalization.

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process
continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various
approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate
forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks.
However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within
the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and
newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing
data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination
mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning
objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has
two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs
global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then
guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve
balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the
task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of
logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces
the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity
to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves
balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and
improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks,
yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: TRIX is a feature-aware adversarial training framework that adaptively assigns adversaries to classes based on their vulnerability, improving fairness and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial training methods treat all classes uniformly, leading to unfair robustness where some classes remain vulnerable. TRIX addresses this by adapting training based on class-wise vulnerabilities.

Method: TRIX assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes and stronger untargeted adversaries to weak classes, with per-class loss weighting and perturbation adjustments.

Result: TRIX improves worst-case class accuracy on clean and adversarial data, reduces inter-class robustness disparities, and maintains overall accuracy.

Conclusion: TRIX advances fair and effective adversarial defense by addressing class-wise vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is a widely adopted defense against adversarial
examples. However, existing approaches typically apply a uniform training
objective across all classes, overlooking disparities in class-wise
vulnerability. This results in adversarial unfairness: classes with well
distinguishable features (strong classes) tend to become more robust, while
classes with overlapping or shared features(weak classes) remain
disproportionately susceptible to adversarial attacks. We observe that strong
classes do not require strong adversaries during training, as their non-robust
features are quickly suppressed. In contrast, weak classes benefit from
stronger adversaries to effectively reduce their vulnerabilities. Motivated by
this, we introduce TRIX, a feature-aware adversarial training framework that
adaptively assigns weaker targeted adversaries to strong classes, promoting
feature diversity via uniformly sampled targets, and stronger untargeted
adversaries to weak classes, enhancing their focused robustness. TRIX further
incorporates per-class loss weighting and perturbation strength adjustments,
building on prior work, to emphasize weak classes during the optimization.
Comprehensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks,
including evaluations under strong attacks such as PGD and AutoAttack,
demonstrate that TRIX significantly improves worst-case class accuracy on both
clean and adversarial data, reducing inter-class robustness disparities, and
preserves overall accuracy. Our results highlight TRIX as a practical step
toward fair and effective adversarial defense.

*Wooseong Jeong,Jegyeong Cho,Youngho Yoon,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: S4T synchronizes multiple tasks during test-time training to address domain shifts, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in generalizing neural networks to unseen domains, especially when handling multiple tasks with unsynchronized adaptation needs.

Method: Proposes S4T, which predicts task relations across domain shifts to synchronize tasks during test-time training.

Result: Empirical results show S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods on multi-task benchmarks.

Conclusion: S4T effectively synchronizes tasks under domain shifts, improving generalization for multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant
challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by
using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by
distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when
models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional
TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation
steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the
requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach
called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the
concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that
predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks
during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional
multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our
empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across
various benchmarks.

*Marie-Christine Pali,Christina Schwaiger,Malik Galijasevic,Valentin K. Ladenhauf,Stephanie Mangesius,Elke R. Gizewski*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised deep learning approach for carotid artery segmentation in multi-sequence MRI data, addressing plaque complexity and limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery plaques is vital for atherosclerosis and stroke risk assessment, but complex morphology and scarce labeled data pose challenges.

Method: Proposes a two-network system: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation, using a multi-level U-Net and semi-supervised learning with input transformations.

Result: Evaluated on 52 patients, the method shows effectiveness, emphasizing fusion strategy importance and expert-validated accuracy.

Conclusion: Fusion strategies and semi-supervised learning improve carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI applications.

Abstract: The analysis of carotid arteries, particularly plaques, in multi-sequence
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data is crucial for assessing the risk of
atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke. In order to evaluate metrics and radiomic
features, quantifying the state of atherosclerosis, accurate segmentation is
important. However, the complex morphology of plaques and the scarcity of
labeled data poses significant challenges. In this work, we address these
problems and propose a semi-supervised deep learning-based approach designed to
effectively integrate multi-sequence MRI data for the segmentation of carotid
artery vessel wall and plaque. The proposed algorithm consists of two networks:
a coarse localization model identifies the region of interest guided by some
prior knowledge on the position and number of carotid arteries, followed by a
fine segmentation model for precise delineation of vessel walls and plaques. To
effectively integrate complementary information across different MRI sequences,
we investigate different fusion strategies and introduce a multi-level
multi-sequence version of U-Net architecture. To address the challenges of
limited labeled data and the complexity of carotid artery MRI, we propose a
semi-supervised approach that enforces consistency under various input
transformations. Our approach is evaluated on 52 patients with
arteriosclerosis, each with five MRI sequences. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and emphasize the role of fusion
point selection in U-Net-based architectures. To validate the accuracy of our
results, we also include an expert-based assessment of model performance. Our
findings highlight the potential of fusion strategies and semi-supervised
learning for improving carotid artery segmentation in data-limited MRI
applications.

*Bardia Hejazi,Keerthana Chand,Tobias Fritsch,Giovanni Bruno*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The study explores deep learning-based compression of XCT data, comparing D-CNN and VQ-VAE architectures for quality and edge preservation in recovered images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient storage of large imaging datasets due to advancements in imaging technologies.

Method: Used D-CNN and VQ-VAE architectures with varying compression rates on XCT data of a sandstone sample, introducing an edge-sensitive metric for quality assessment.

Result: Different architectures and compression rates are needed based on specific data characteristics to preserve quality for analysis.

Conclusion: The findings help scientists choose appropriate storage and analysis strategies for their imaging data.

Abstract: The ever-growing volume of data in imaging sciences stemming from the
advancements in imaging technologies, necessitates efficient and reliable
storage solutions for such large datasets. This study investigates the
compression of industrial X-ray computed tomography (XCT) data using deep
learning autoencoders and examines how these compression algorithms affect the
quality of the recovered data. Two network architectures with different
compression rates were used, a deep convolution neural network (D-CNN) and a
vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE). The XCT data used was from a
sandstone sample with a complex internal pore network. The quality of the
decoded images obtained from the two different deep learning architectures with
different compression rates were quantified and compared to the original input
data. In addition, to improve image decoding quality metrics, we introduced a
metric sensitive to edge preservation, which is crucial for three-dimensional
data analysis. We showed that different architectures and compression rates are
required depending on the specific characteristics needed to be preserved for
later analysis. The findings presented here can aid scientists to determine the
requirements and strategies for their data storage and analysis needs.

*Zhenyu Jin,Yisi Luo,Xile Zhao,Deyu Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GridTD is an unsupervised continuous representation framework for compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, combining multi-resolution grid encoding and tensor decomposition for efficient and accurate high-dimensional image recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unsupervised representations for CI reconstruction struggle to balance representation ability and efficiency, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: GridTD optimizes a lightweight neural network and tensor decomposition model using multi-resolution hash grid encoding, leveraging hierarchical modeling and compactness.

Result: Theoretical analyses and experiments show GridTD outperforms existing methods in tasks like video SCI, spectral SCI, and dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Conclusion: GridTD is a versatile, state-of-the-art method for CI reconstruction, offering superior performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Compressive imaging (CI) reconstruction, such as snapshot compressive imaging
(SCI) and compressive sensing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), aims to recover
high-dimensional images from low-dimensional compressed measurements. This
process critically relies on learning an accurate representation of the
underlying high-dimensional image. However, existing unsupervised
representations may struggle to achieve a desired balance between
representation ability and efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose
Tensor Decomposed multi-resolution Grid encoding (GridTD), an unsupervised
continuous representation framework for CI reconstruction. GridTD optimizes a
lightweight neural network and the input tensor decomposition model whose
parameters are learned via multi-resolution hash grid encoding. It inherently
enjoys the hierarchical modeling ability of multi-resolution grid encoding and
the compactness of tensor decomposition, enabling effective and efficient
reconstruction of high-dimensional images. Theoretical analyses for the
algorithm's Lipschitz property, generalization error bound, and fixed-point
convergence reveal the intrinsic superiority of GridTD as compared with
existing continuous representation models. Extensive experiments across diverse
CI tasks, including video SCI, spectral SCI, and compressive dynamic MRI
reconstruction, consistently demonstrate the superiority of GridTD over
existing methods, positioning GridTD as a versatile and state-of-the-art CI
reconstruction method.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A generative framework synthesizes breast ultrasound (BUS) images with controlled tumor characteristics, enhancing deep learning models for breast cancer diagnosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The scarcity of expert-annotated BUS data limits robust deep learning model development.

Method: The framework integrates clinical descriptions and structural masks to generate tumors, using a semantic-curvature mask generator for diversity. Synthetic masks guide the creation of personalized BUS images.

Result: Quantitative evaluations on six datasets show clinical utility, and visual Turing tests confirm realism.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates realistic BUS images, improving breast cancer diagnosis and supporting clinical applications.

Abstract: The development of robust deep learning models for breast ultrasound (BUS)
image analysis is significantly constrained by the scarcity of expert-annotated
data. To address this limitation, we propose a clinically controllable
generative framework for synthesizing BUS images. This framework integrates
clinical descriptions with structural masks to generate tumors, enabling
fine-grained control over tumor characteristics such as morphology,
echogencity, and shape. Furthermore, we design a semantic-curvature mask
generator, which synthesizes structurally diverse tumor masks guided by
clinical priors. During inference, synthetic tumor masks serve as input to the
generative framework, producing highly personalized synthetic BUS images with
tumors that reflect real-world morphological diversity. Quantitative
evaluations on six public BUS datasets demonstrate the significant clinical
utility of our synthetic images, showing their effectiveness in enhancing
downstream breast cancer diagnosis tasks. Furthermore, visual Turing tests
conducted by experienced sonographers confirm the realism of the generated
images, indicating the framework's potential to support broader clinical
applications.

### [171] [MeD-3D: A Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Precise Recurrence Prediction in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07839)
*Hasaan Maqsood,Saif Ur Rehman Khan*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework integrates multimodal data (CT, MRI, histopathology, clinical, genomic) to improve recurrence prediction in ccRCC, addressing limitations of single-modality models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional prognostic models for ccRCC recurrence rely on single data modalities, leading to suboptimal accuracy due to disease complexity.

Method: The framework uses domain-specific models (CLAM for histopathology, MeD-3D for CT/MRI, MLP for clinical/genomic data) and fuses features via early/late integration, handling incomplete data.

Result: The multimodal DL approach enhances predictive accuracy by combining complementary data sources and accommodates missing modalities.

Conclusion: This framework improves ccRCC recurrence prediction and clinical decision-making by leveraging diverse data types.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of recurrence in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)
remains a major clinical challenge due to the disease complex molecular,
pathological, and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional prognostic models, which
rely on single data modalities such as radiology, histopathology, or genomics,
often fail to capture the full spectrum of disease complexity, resulting in
suboptimal predictive accuracy. This study aims to overcome these limitations
by proposing a deep learning (DL) framework that integrates multimodal data,
including CT, MRI, histopathology whole slide images (WSI), clinical data, and
genomic profiles, to improve the prediction of ccRCC recurrence and enhance
clinical decision-making. The proposed framework utilizes a comprehensive
dataset curated from multiple publicly available sources, including TCGA, TCIA,
and CPTAC. To process the diverse modalities, domain-specific models are
employed: CLAM, a ResNet50-based model, is used for histopathology WSIs, while
MeD-3D, a pre-trained 3D-ResNet18 model, processes CT and MRI images. For
structured clinical and genomic data, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is used.
These models are designed to extract deep feature embeddings from each
modality, which are then fused through an early and late integration
architecture. This fusion strategy enables the model to combine complementary
information from multiple sources. Additionally, the framework is designed to
handle incomplete data, a common challenge in clinical settings, by enabling
inference even when certain modalities are missing.

*Abrar Faiyaz,Nhat Hoang,Giovanni Schifitto,Md Nasir Uddin*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ArteryX is a MATLAB-based toolbox for quantifying vascular features from 3D TOF MRA, addressing limitations of existing methods with high accuracy, efficiency, and minimal user intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cerebrovascular pathology impacts cognitive health, but current MRA evaluations lack quantitative metrics for subtle vascular changes. Existing methods are inconsistent and lack standardization.

Method: ArteryX uses a semi-supervised, vessel-fused network approach for landmarking and tracing, integrating a simulation framework for validation.

Result: Validated in cerebral small vessel disease patients, ArteryX showed improved sensitivity to vascular changes and outperformed existing semi-automated methods.

Conclusion: ArteryX offers a standardized, efficient tool for early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and advancing research on vascular contributions to brain health.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular pathology significantly contributes to cognitive decline and
neurological disorders, underscoring the need for advanced tools to assess
vascular integrity. Three-dimensional Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance
Angiography (3D TOF MRA) is widely used to visualize cerebral vasculature,
however, clinical evaluations generally focus on major arterial abnormalities,
overlooking quantitative metrics critical for understanding subtle vascular
changes. Existing methods for extracting structural, geometrical and
morphological arterial features from MRA - whether manual or automated - face
challenges including user-dependent variability, steep learning curves, and
lack of standardized quantitative validations. We propose a novel
semi-supervised artery evaluation framework, named ArteryX, a MATLAB-based
toolbox that quantifies vascular features with high accuracy and efficiency,
achieving processing times ~10-15 minutes per subject at 0.5 mm resolution with
minimal user intervention. ArteryX employs a vessel-fused network based
landmarking approach to reliably track and manage tracings, effectively
addressing the issue of dangling/disconnected vessels. Validation on human
subjects with cerebral small vessel disease demonstrated its improved
sensitivity to subtle vascular changes and better performance than an existing
semi-automated method. Importantly, the ArteryX toolbox enables quantitative
feature validation by integrating an in-vivo like artery simulation framework
utilizing vessel-fused graph nodes and predefined ground-truth features for
specific artery types. Thus, the ArteryX framework holds promise for
benchmarking feature extraction toolboxes and for seamless integration into
clinical workflows, enabling early detection of cerebrovascular pathology and
standardized comparisons across patient cohorts to advance understanding of
vascular contributions to brain health.

*Youssef ElTantawy,Alexia Karantana,Xin Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep-learning method for wrist bone segmentation in X-rays using simulated CT-generated images to address the challenge of limited annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X-ray image segmentation is crucial for diagnostics but suffers from a lack of high-quality annotated data, especially for small carpal bones.

Method: Utilizes simulated X-ray images from CT volumes with bone labels to train a deep learning model, evaluated on both simulated and real X-ray images.

Result: Achieved Dice scores of 0.80-0.92 on simulated data and demonstrated strong performance on real X-rays.

Conclusion: The method effectively addresses annotation challenges and performs well, with the model and simulation code made available for research.

Abstract: Plain X-ray is one of the most common image modalities for clinical diagnosis
(e.g. bone fracture, pneumonia, cancer screening, etc.). X-ray image
segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems,
yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior
performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large
amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an
annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of
expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in
X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image.
To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of
simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with
their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for
wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated
using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores
ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different
view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray
images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The
trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research
purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.

TL;DR: A label-efficient strategy for chest X-ray diagnosis using CLIP ViT-B/32 model, achieving 20% improvement in AUC over zero-shot baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of limited labeled datasets in medical imaging due to privacy, cost, and case scarcity.

Method: Partial fine-tuning of CLIP's visual encoder, evaluated via zero-shot and few-shot learning (1-16 labeled examples per class).

Result: CLIP's pre-trained features adapt well, showing significant improvement in AUC scores.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, scalable solution for few-shot medical imaging, simulating real-world hospital workflows.

Abstract: Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on
large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to
privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a
label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to
reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest
X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via
partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot
and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests
demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively
adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in
mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this
work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image
archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and
scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this
research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not
been peer reviewed yet. All code is found at

TL;DR: IDEAL-IO improves IDEAL by decoupling density estimation and optical parameter optimization, reducing runtime and memory usage while enabling better designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high memory usage, long runtimes, and mismatched objectives in IDEAL for information-driven imaging system design.

Method: Introduces IDEAL-IO, which alternates between fitting models to measurements and updating optical parameters, decoupling density estimation from optimization.

Result: Reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x, enabling more expressive density models and superior designs.

Conclusion: IDEAL-IO makes information-theoretic optimization practical and scalable for real-world imaging system design.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through
the information content of their measurements alone, enabling
application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding
challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed
to automate this process through gradient-based. In this work, we study IDEAL
across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage,
long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to
end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with
Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density
estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting
models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed
models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory
usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide
optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive
optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing
information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for
real-world imaging system design.
