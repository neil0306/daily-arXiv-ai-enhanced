### [1] [An Empirical Analysis of Discrete Unit Representations in Speech Language Modeling Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05359)
*Yanis Labrak,Richard Dufour,MickaÃ«l Rouvier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Analysis of discrete unit representations in Speech Language Models, focusing on how model architecture, data representation, and training robustness affect speech modeling during continual pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize speech modeling during continual pre-training by adapting existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality and understanding how different factors influence this process.

Method: Systematically examined model architecture, data representation, and training robustness; analyzed speech encoders and clustering granularity across different model scales; investigated cluster distribution and phonemic alignments; explored clustering data selection impact.

Result: Found that optimal discretization strategies vary with model capacity; uncovered both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns in discrete vocabulary usage; highlighted importance of domain matching between discretization training and target applications.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into effective discrete unit representations for SLMs, showing that model capacity, clustering strategies, and domain alignment are critical factors for successful speech modeling adaptation.

Abstract: This paper investigates discrete unit representations in Speech Language
Models (SLMs), focusing on optimizing speech modeling during continual
pre-training. In this paper, we systematically examine how model architecture,
data representation, and training robustness influence the pre-training stage
in which we adapt existing pre-trained language models to the speech modality.
Our experiments highlight the role of speech encoders and clustering
granularity across different model scales, showing how optimal discretization
strategies vary with model capacity. By examining cluster distribution and
phonemic alignments, we investigate the effective use of discrete vocabulary,
uncovering both linguistic and paralinguistic patterns. Additionally, we
explore the impact of clustering data selection on model robustness,
highlighting the importance of domain matching between discretization training
and target applications.

### [2] [Beyond ROUGE: N-Gram Subspace Features for LLM Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05360)
*Jerry Li,Evangelos Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel N-Gram frequency tensor approach for LLM hallucination detection that outperforms traditional metrics and competes with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods rely on metrics like ROUGE, BERTScore, and Perplexity that lack sufficient semantic depth to effectively identify hallucinations in LLM-generated text.

Method: Constructs N-Gram frequency tensor from LLM-generated text to capture richer semantic structure through co-occurrence patterns, then applies tensor decomposition to extract singular values as features for an MLP binary classifier.

Result: Evaluated on HaluEval dataset, shows significant improvements over traditional baselines and competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

Conclusion: The proposed tensor-based approach provides a more effective method for detecting hallucinations in LLM outputs by capturing deeper semantic patterns than traditional metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness across a wide
variety of tasks involving natural language, however, a fundamental problem of
hallucinations still plagues these models, limiting their trustworthiness in
generating consistent, truthful information. Detecting hallucinations has
quickly become an important topic, with various methods such as uncertainty
estimation, LLM Judges, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and consistency
checks showing promise. Many of these methods build upon foundational metrics,
such as ROUGE, BERTScore, or Perplexity, which often lack the semantic depth
necessary to detect hallucinations effectively. In this work, we propose a
novel approach inspired by ROUGE that constructs an N-Gram frequency tensor
from LLM-generated text. This tensor captures richer semantic structure by
encoding co-occurrence patterns, enabling better differentiation between
factual and hallucinated content. We demonstrate this by applying tensor
decomposition methods to extract singular values from each mode and use these
as input features to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) binary classifier for
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated on the HaluEval dataset and
demonstrates significant improvements over traditional baselines, as well as
competitive performance against state-of-the-art LLM judges.

### [3] [A Lightweight Framework for Trigger-Guided LoRA-Based Self-Adaptation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05385)
*Jiacheng Wei,Faguo Wu,Xiao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE is a dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables large language models to adapt and learn from new data during inference time by decomposing complex reasoning into atomic subtasks and performing real-time updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models cannot continuously adapt and learn from new data during reasoning at inference time, limiting their ability to handle dynamic reasoning tasks.

Method: SAGE uses three components: Trigger module for real-time failure detection, Trigger Buffer for clustering anomaly samples with HDBSCAN and stability checks, and Lora Store for dynamic parameter optimization with adapter pool.

Result: SAGE demonstrates excellent accuracy, robustness, and stability on atomic reasoning subtasks through dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully enables adaptive updates during reasoning at inference time, addressing the limitation of static LLM behavior and improving performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models are unable to continuously adapt and learn from new
data during reasoning at inference time. To address this limitation, we propose
that complex reasoning tasks be decomposed into atomic subtasks and introduce
SAGE, a trigger-guided dynamic fine-tuning framework that enables adaptive
updates during reasoning at inference time. SAGE consists of three key
components: (1) a Trigger module that detects reasoning failures through
multiple evaluation metrics in real time; (2) a Trigger Buffer module that
clusters anomaly samples using a streaming clustering process with HDBSCAN,
followed by stability checks and similarity-based merging; and (3) a Lora Store
module that dynamically optimizes parameter updates with an adapter pool for
knowledge retention. Evaluation results show that SAGE demonstrates excellent
accuracy, robustness, and stability on the atomic reasoning subtask through
dynamic knowledge updating during test time.

### [4] [Talk Isn't Always Cheap: Understanding Failure Modes in Multi-Agent Debate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05396)
*Andrea Wynn,Harsh Satija,Gillian Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-agent debate can harm reasoning accuracy, especially with diverse model capabilities, as models prioritize agreement over challenging incorrect reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how diversity in model capabilities affects multi-agent debate outcomes, challenging the assumption that debate always improves reasoning.

Method: Conducted experiments with heterogeneous groups of AI models with varying capabilities, analyzing debate dynamics and accuracy changes over time.

Result: Debate decreased accuracy even when stronger models outnumbered weaker ones, with models frequently shifting from correct to incorrect answers to achieve consensus.

Conclusion: Naive debate applications may degrade performance when agents aren't incentivized to resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning, revealing important failure modes in multi-agent reasoning exchanges.

Abstract: While multi-agent debate has been proposed as a promising strategy for
improving AI reasoning ability, we find that debate can sometimes be harmful
rather than helpful. The prior work has exclusively focused on debates within
homogeneous groups of agents, whereas we explore how diversity in model
capabilities influences the dynamics and outcomes of multi-agent interactions.
Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that debate can lead to a
decrease in accuracy over time -- even in settings where stronger (i.e., more
capable) models outnumber their weaker counterparts. Our analysis reveals that
models frequently shift from correct to incorrect answers in response to peer
reasoning, favoring agreement over challenging flawed reasoning. These results
highlight important failure modes in the exchange of reasons during multi-agent
debate, suggesting that naive applications of debate may cause performance
degradation when agents are neither incentivized nor adequately equipped to
resist persuasive but incorrect reasoning.

### [5] [No Translation Needed: Forecasting Quality from Fertility and Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05425)
*Jessica M. Lundin,Ada Zhang,David Adelani,Cody Carroll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Translation quality can be accurately predicted without running the translation system using token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic metadata, achieving RÂ² scores of 0.66-0.72 across 203 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for predicting translation quality without the computational expense of running actual translation systems, using only simple features and metadata.

Method: Used gradient boosting models with features including token fertility ratios, token counts, and linguistic metadata (language family, script, region) to predict ChrF scores for GPT-4o translations on FLORES-200 benchmark across 203 languages.

Result: Achieved RÂ²=0.66 for translations into English and RÂ²=0.72 for translations from English into other languages. Feature importance analysis showed typological factors dominate predictions into English, while fertility plays larger role for diverse target languages.

Conclusion: Translation quality is shaped by both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, providing new insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation without requiring actual translation system execution.

Abstract: We show that translation quality can be predicted with surprising accuracy
\textit{without ever running the translation system itself}. Using only a
handful of features, token fertility ratios, token counts, and basic linguistic
metadata (language family, script, and region), we can forecast ChrF scores for
GPT-4o translations across 203 languages in the FLORES-200 benchmark. Gradient
boosting models achieve favorable performance ($R^{2}=0.66$ for
XX$\rightarrow$English and $R^{2}=0.72$ for English$\rightarrow$XX). Feature
importance analyses reveal that typological factors dominate predictions into
English, while fertility plays a larger role for translations into diverse
target languages. These findings suggest that translation quality is shaped by
both token-level fertility and broader linguistic typology, offering new
insights for multilingual evaluation and quality estimation.

### [6] [Direct-Scoring NLG Evaluators Can Use Pairwise Comparisons Too](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05440)
*Logan Lawrence,Ashton Williamson,Alexander Shelton*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a direct-scoring method using synthetic summaries to enable absolute scoring for individual text samples while maintaining performance comparable to pairwise evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pairwise comparison methods for evaluating machine-generated text lack the ability to assign absolute scores to individual summaries, which is crucial for thresholding applications.

Method: Uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time, enabling direct scoring of individual text samples rather than just relative comparisons.

Result: Performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise evaluators on SummEval (+0.03), TopicalChat (-0.03), and HANNA (+0.05) benchmarks for sample-level correlations.

Conclusion: The method provides absolute scoring capability while maintaining competitive performance with pairwise approaches, with synthetic in-context summaries released to facilitate future work.

Abstract: As large-language models have been increasingly used as automatic raters for
evaluating free-form content, including document summarization, dialog, and
story generation, work has been dedicated to evaluating such models by
measuring their correlations with human judgment. For \textit{sample-level}
performance, methods which operate by using pairwise comparisons between
machine-generated text perform well but often lack the ability to assign
absolute scores to individual summaries, an ability crucial for use cases that
require thresholding. In this work, we propose a direct-scoring method which
uses synthetic summaries to act as pairwise machine rankings at test time. We
show that our method performs comparably to state-of-the-art pairwise
evaluators in terms of axis-averaged sample-level correlations on the SummEval
(\textbf{+0.03}), TopicalChat (\textbf{-0.03}), and HANNA (\textbf{+0.05})
meta-evaluation benchmarks, and release the synthetic in-context summaries as
data to facilitate future work.

### [7] [From Staff Messages to Actionable Insights: A Multi-Stage LLM Classification Framework for Healthcare Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05484)
*Hajar Sakai,Yi-En Tseng,Mohammadsadegh Mikaeili,Joshua Bosire,Franziska Jovin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-based framework for analyzing hospital call center staff messages to identify topics and classify reasons, achieving up to 79.2% accuracy with HIPAA-compliant processing and visualization tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hospital call centers generate large volumes of text data from patient interactions, but traditional supervised learning requires extensive annotated data and training. LLMs offer a more efficient approach for healthcare analytics.

Method: Multi-stage LLM framework using reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models to identify message topics and classify reasons in multi-class fashion. Includes data security and HIPAA compliance measures.

Result: Best-performing model (o3) achieved 78.4% weighted F1-score and 79.2% accuracy, followed by gpt-5 (75.3% F1-score, 76.2% accuracy). Processed outputs integrated into visualization decision support tool.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient utilization of staff messaging data, identifies training opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality through actionable insights for healthcare professionals.

Abstract: Hospital call centers serve as the primary contact point for patients within
a hospital system. They also generate substantial volumes of staff messages as
navigators process patient requests and communicate with the hospital offices
following the established protocol restrictions and guidelines. This
continuously accumulated large amount of text data can be mined and processed
to retrieve insights; however, traditional supervised learning approaches
require annotated data, extensive training, and model tuning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer a paradigm shift toward more computationally efficient
methodologies for healthcare analytics. This paper presents a multi-stage
LLM-based framework that identifies staff message topics and classifies
messages by their reasons in a multi-class fashion. In the process, multiple
LLM types, including reasoning, general-purpose, and lightweight models, were
evaluated. The best-performing model was o3, achieving 78.4% weighted F1-score
and 79.2% accuracy, followed closely by gpt-5 (75.3% Weighted F1-score and
76.2% accuracy). The proposed methodology incorporates data security measures
and HIPAA compliance requirements essential for healthcare environments. The
processed LLM outputs are integrated into a visualization decision support tool
that transforms the staff messages into actionable insights accessible to
healthcare professionals. This approach enables more efficient utilization of
the collected staff messaging data, identifies navigator training
opportunities, and supports improved patient experience and care quality.

### [8] [The Token Tax: Systematic Bias in Multilingual Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05486)
*Jessica M. Lundin,Ada Zhang,Nihal Karim,Hamza Louzan,Victor Wei,David Adelani,Cody Carroll*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Tokenization inefficiency in morphologically complex languages causes higher computational costs and lower accuracy in LLMs, with fertility (tokens/word) reliably predicting performance on African language benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the structural disadvantages that tokenization inefficiency imposes on morphologically complex, low-resource languages, which inflate compute resources and depress accuracy in natural language processing.

Method: Evaluated 10 large language models on AfriMMLU dataset (9,000 multiple-choice questions across 5 subjects and 16 African languages), analyzing fertility (tokens per word) as a predictor of accuracy and comparing reasoning vs non-reasoning models.

Result: Higher fertility consistently predicts lower accuracy across all models and subjects. Reasoning models (DeepSeek, o1) outperform non-reasoning peers across both high and low resource languages, narrowing accuracy gaps. A doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time.

Conclusion: The findings motivate the need for morphologically aware tokenization, fair pricing models, and multilingual benchmarks to achieve equitable natural language processing for all languages.

Abstract: Tokenization inefficiency imposes structural disadvantages on morphologically
complex, low-resource languages, inflating compute resources and depressing
accuracy. We evaluate 10 large language models (LLMs) on AfriMMLU (9,000 MCQA
items; 5 subjects; 16 African languages) and show that fertility (tokens/word)
reliably predicts accuracy. Higher fertility consistently predicts lower
accuracy across all models and subjects. We further find that reasoning models
(DeepSeek, o1) consistently outperform non-reasoning peers across high and low
resource languages in the AfriMMLU dataset, narrowing accuracy gaps observed in
prior generations. Finally, translating token inflation to economics, a
doubling in tokens results in quadrupled training cost and time, underscoring
the token tax faced by many languages. These results motivate morphologically
aware tokenization, fair pricing, and multilingual benchmarks for equitable
natural language processing (NLP).

### [9] [Biomedical Literature Q&A System Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05505)
*Mansi Garg,Lee-Chi Wang,Bhavesh Ghanchi,Sanjana Dumpala,Shreyash Kakde,Yen Chih Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A biomedical Q&A system using RAG architecture with MiniLM embeddings and fine-tuned Mistral-7B model shows improved accuracy in medical information retrieval and response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address shortcomings of conventional health search engines and bridge the gap between complex biomedical literature and accessible public health knowledge.

Method: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture integrating PubMed articles, Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias. Uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings with FAISS vector search, and fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 optimized with QLoRA.

Result: Substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance compared to baseline models, demonstrated through focused evaluation on breast cancer literature using BERTScore (F1).

Conclusion: RAG-enhanced language models show potential for bridging biomedical literature and public health knowledge, with future directions including multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized medical AI systems.

Abstract: This work presents a Biomedical Literature Question Answering (Q&A) system
based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, designed to
improve access to accurate, evidence-based medical information. Addressing the
shortcomings of conventional health search engines and the lag in public access
to biomedical research, the system integrates diverse sources, including PubMed
articles, curated Q&A datasets, and medical encyclopedias ,to retrieve relevant
information and generate concise, context-aware responses. The retrieval
pipeline uses MiniLM-based semantic embeddings and FAISS vector search, while
answer generation is performed by a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-v0.3 language model
optimized using QLoRA for efficient, low-resource training. The system supports
both general medical queries and domain-specific tasks, with a focused
evaluation on breast cancer literature demonstrating the value of
domain-aligned retrieval. Empirical results, measured using BERTScore (F1),
show substantial improvements in factual consistency and semantic relevance
compared to baseline models. The findings underscore the potential of
RAG-enhanced language models to bridge the gap between complex biomedical
literature and accessible public health knowledge, paving the way for future
work on multilingual adaptation, privacy-preserving inference, and personalized
medical AI systems.

### [10] [Using Contrastive Learning to Improve Two-Way Reasoning in Large Language Models: The Obfuscation Task as a Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05553)
*Serge Lionel Nikiema,Jordan Samhi,Micheline BÃ©nÃ©dicte Moumoula,AlbÃ©rick Euraste DjirÃ©,Abdoul Kader KaborÃ©,Jacques Klein,TegawendÃ© F. BissyandÃ©*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bidirectional reasoning as a test for true AI understanding - models should handle transformations in both directions without reverse training. Current models show cognitive specialization where forward fine-tuning hurts reverse capabilities. Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT) solves this by training with positive, negative, and obfuscation examples to develop genuine bidirectional understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether large language models truly understand concepts or just recognize patterns, using bidirectional reasoning (ability to apply transformations in both directions without explicit reverse training) as a test for genuine comprehension.

Method: Developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT) approach using three example types: positive examples maintaining semantic meaning, negative examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples. Tested current language models and compared with CFT-trained models.

Result: Discovered cognitive specialization - forward fine-tuning improves specific task performance but significantly degrades bidirectional reasoning. CFT successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse performance while maintaining forward capabilities without explicit reverse training.

Conclusion: Bidirectional reasoning serves as both a theoretical framework for assessing genuine AI understanding and a practical training approach (CFT) for developing more capable AI systems that comprehend concepts rather than just recognizing patterns.

Abstract: This research addresses a fundamental question in AI: whether large language
models truly understand concepts or simply recognize patterns. The authors
propose bidirectional reasoning,the ability to apply transformations in both
directions without being explicitly trained on the reverse direction, as a test
for genuine understanding. They argue that true comprehension should naturally
allow reversibility. For example, a model that can change a variable name like
userIndex to i should also be able to infer that i represents a user index
without reverse training. The researchers tested current language models and
discovered what they term cognitive specialization: when models are fine-tuned
on forward tasks, their performance on those tasks improves, but their ability
to reason bidirectionally becomes significantly worse. To address this issue,
they developed Contrastive Fine-Tuning (CFT), which trains models using three
types of examples: positive examples that maintain semantic meaning, negative
examples with different semantics, and forward-direction obfuscation examples.
This approach aims to develop deeper understanding rather than surface-level
pattern recognition and allows reverse capabilities to develop naturally
without explicit reverse training. Their experiments demonstrated that CFT
successfully achieved bidirectional reasoning, enabling strong reverse
performance while maintaining forward task capabilities. The authors conclude
that bidirectional reasoning serves both as a theoretical framework for
assessing genuine understanding and as a practical training approach for
developing more capable AI systems.

### [11] [Ad hoc conventions generalize to new referents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05566)
*Anya Ji,Claire Augusta Bergey,Ron Eliav,Yoav Artzi,Robert D. Hawkins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: People develop shared naming systems through conceptual alignment rather than arbitrary labeling, with new naming conventions generalizing to unseen similar objects following Shepard's law.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how people establish shared naming conventions for novel objects and whether these conventions are arbitrary labels or reflect deeper conceptual alignment that generalizes to new referents.

Method: Dyadic communication study with 302 participants using the KiloGram dataset of abstract tangram images. Pairs coordinated on referential conventions for one set of images, then alignment was measured for undiscussed images.

Result: Strong evidence for generalization - partners showed increased alignment for undiscussed images relative to pre-test labels. Generalization decayed nonlinearly with visual similarity (following Shepard's law) and was robust across different levels of image nameability.

Conclusion: Ad hoc naming conventions are not arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, suggesting implications for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

Abstract: How do people talk about things they've never talked about before? One view
suggests that a new shared naming system establishes an arbitrary link to a
specific target, like proper names that cannot extend beyond their bearers. An
alternative view proposes that forming a shared way of describing objects
involves broader conceptual alignment, reshaping each individual's semantic
space in ways that should generalize to new referents. We test these competing
accounts in a dyadic communication study (N=302) leveraging the
recently-released KiloGram dataset containing over 1,000 abstract tangram
images. After pairs of participants coordinated on referential conventions for
one set of images through repeated communication, we measured the extent to
which their descriptions aligned for undiscussed images. We found strong
evidence for generalization: partners showed increased alignment relative to
their pre-test labels. Generalization also decayed nonlinearly with visual
similarity (consistent with Shepard's law) and was robust across levels of the
images' nameability. These findings suggest that ad hoc conventions are not
arbitrary labels but reflect genuine conceptual coordination, with implications
for theories of reference and the design of more adaptive language agents.

### [12] [Mitigating Spurious Correlations Between Question and Answer via Chain-of-Thought Correctness Perception Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05602)
*Hongyan Xie,Yitong Yao,Yikun Ban,Zixuan Huang,Deqing Wang,Zhenhe Wu,Haoxiang Su,Chao Wang,Shuangyong Song,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoPeD improves small language model reasoning by filtering noisy chain-of-thought data and using correctness-aware training to focus on high-quality rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models fine-tuned on LLM-generated chain-of-thought data often learn from noisy rationales that don't properly support answers, leading to poor reasoning quality.

Method: Proposes correctness-aware task setting that makes models predict answers based on correct rationales and revise incorrect ones, plus a weighted loss that prioritizes samples where rationales strongly support correct answers.

Result: Effective on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmark reasoning datasets.

Conclusion: CoPeD successfully improves reasoning quality in small language models by addressing noise in chain-of-thought distillation through correctness-aware training strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning tasks but are expensive to
deploy. Thus small language models (SLMs) are fine-tuned on CoT data generated
by LLMs to copy LLMs' abilities. However, these CoT data may include noisy
rationales that either fail to substantiate the answers or contribute no
additional information to support answer prediction, which leads SLMs to
capture spurious correlations between questions and answers and compromise the
quality of reasoning. In this work, we propose Chain-of-Thought Correctness
Perception Distillation (CoPeD), which aims to improve the reasoning quality of
the student model from the perspectives of task setting and data utilization.
Firstly, we introduce a correctness-aware task setting that encourages the
student model to predict answers based on correct rationales and revise them
when they are incorrect. This setting improves the faithfulness of reasoning
and allows the model to learn from its mistakes. Then, we propose a
Correctness-Aware Weighted loss, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of
each training instance based on the combined loss of the rationale and the
answer. This strategy encourages the model to focus more on samples where the
rationale offers stronger support for the correct answer. Experiments have
shown that CoPeD is effective on both in-distribution (IND) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets.

*Qiyuan Chen,Hongsen Huang,Qian Shao,Jiahe Chen,Jintai Chen,Hongxia Xu,Renjie Hua,Ren Chuan,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IconÂ² is a novel method that leverages LLMs' representation space to efficiently construct high-quality preference datasets by extracting layer-wise direction vectors and applying bidirectional inherent control during decoding, achieving significant alignment improvements while reducing computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods for constructing preference datasets face distribution mismatches with target models and high computational overhead from sampling multiple stochastic responses.

Method: Extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode human preferences, filters self-synthesized instructions based on inherent consistency, and applies bidirectional inherent control during decoding to generate response pairs with clear alignment distinctions.

Result: Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve average win rate improvements of 13.89% on AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by up to 48.1%.

Conclusion: IconÂ² demonstrates a paradigm shift in preference dataset construction by leveraging LLMs' inherent representation space regulation, achieving both superior alignment performance and significant efficiency gains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality preference datasets to
align with human preferences. However, conventional methods for constructing
such datasets face significant challenges: reliance on pre-collected
instructions often leads to distribution mismatches with target models, while
the need for sampling multiple stochastic responses introduces substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we explore a paradigm shift by leveraging
inherent regulation of LLMs' representation space for efficient and tailored
preference dataset construction, named Icon$^{2}$. Specifically, it first
extracts layer-wise direction vectors to encode sophisticated human preferences
and then uses these vectors to filter self-synthesized instructions based on
their inherent consistency. During decoding, bidirectional inherent control is
applied to steer token representations, enabling the precise generation of
response pairs with clear alignment distinctions. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in both alignment and efficiency.
Llama3-8B and Qwen2-7B achieve an average win rate improvement of 13.89% on
AlpacaEval 2.0 and 13.45% on Arena-Hard, while reducing computational costs by
up to 48.1%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SEO metrics are obsolete with the shift to Generative Search Engines, creating a need to understand and optimize content influence on synthesized answers.

Method: Built CC-GSEO-Bench benchmark with multi-dimensional evaluation framework, and designed a multi-agent system with analyze-revise-evaluate workflow for automated content refinement.

Result: Framework provides novel insights into content influence dynamics and offers actionable optimization strategies for content creators.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled foundation for GSEO research and enables systematic measurement and optimization of content influence in generative search environments.

Abstract: The paradigm shift from traditional ranked-based search to Generative Search
Engines has rendered conventional SEO metrics obsolete, creating an urgent need
to understand, measure, and optimize for content influence on synthesized
answers. This paper introduces a comprehensive, end-to-end framework for
Generative Search Engine Optimization (GSEO) to address this challenge. We make
two primary contributions. First, we construct CC-GSEO-Bench, a large-scale,
content-centric benchmark, and propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework
that systematically quantifies influence, moving beyond surface-level
attribution to assess substantive semantic impact. Second, we design a novel
multi-agent system that operationalizes this framework, automating the
strategic refinement of content through a collaborative analyze-revise-evaluate
workflow. Our empirical analysis using this framework reveals novel insights
into the dynamics of content influence, offering actionable strategies for
creators and establishing a principled foundation for future GSEO research.

### [15] [New Insights into Optimal Alignment of Acoustic and Linguistic Representations for Knowledge Transfer in ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05609)
*Xugang Lu,Peng Shen,Yu Tsao,Hisashi Kawai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes unbalanced optimal transport for aligning acoustic and linguistic representations in ASR, handling many-to-one and one-to-many mappings with flexible probabilistic matching to improve knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is challenging due to structural asymmetries (many-to-one, one-to-many mappings) and imbalanced matching conditions from noise/silence in acoustic frames.

Method: Unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment model that handles distributional mismatch and structural asymmetries with soft partial matching, ensuring every linguistic token is grounded while allowing flexible probabilistic mappings.

Result: Experimental results on CTC-based ASR system with pre-trained language model demonstrate effectiveness in flexibly controlling matching degree and improving ASR performance.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses alignment challenges in ASR knowledge transfer by treating alignment as a detection problem with unbalanced optimal transport, enabling better handling of structural asymmetries and distributional mismatches.

Abstract: Aligning acoustic and linguistic representations is a central challenge to
bridge the pre-trained models in knowledge transfer for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). This alignment is inherently structured and asymmetric:
while multiple consecutive acoustic frames typically correspond to a single
linguistic token (many-to-one), certain acoustic transition regions may relate
to multiple adjacent tokens (one-to-many). Moreover, acoustic sequences often
include frames with no linguistic counterpart, such as background noise or
silence may lead to imbalanced matching conditions. In this work, we take a new
insight to regard alignment and matching as a detection problem, where the goal
is to identify meaningful correspondences with high precision and recall
ensuring full coverage of linguistic tokens while flexibly handling redundant
or noisy acoustic frames in transferring linguistic knowledge for ASR. Based on
this new insight, we propose an unbalanced optimal transport-based alignment
model that explicitly handles distributional mismatch and structural
asymmetries with soft and partial matching between acoustic and linguistic
modalities. Our method ensures that every linguistic token is grounded in at
least one acoustic observation, while allowing for flexible, probabilistic
mappings from acoustic to linguistic units. We evaluate our proposed model with
experiments on an CTC-based ASR system with a pre-trained language model for
knowledge transfer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in flexibly controlling degree of matching and hence to improve ASR
performance.

*Shay Dahary,Avi Edana,Alexander Apartsin,Yehudit Aperstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes emotional content in song lyrics using multi-label emotion scoring, comparing zero-shot LLMs with fine-tuned BERT models on a manually annotated dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emotional content in lyrics influences listener experiences and musical preferences, and to develop reliable emotion recognition methods for music information retrieval.

Method: Created a manually labeled dataset using mean opinion scores from multiple human raters, evaluated zero-shot performance of various LLMs, and fine-tuned a BERT model for multi-label emotion score prediction.

Result: Experimental results revealed the relative strengths and limitations of both zero-shot and fine-tuned approaches in capturing nuanced emotional content in lyrics.

Conclusion: LLMs show significant potential for emotion recognition in creative texts, providing valuable insights for model selection in emotion-based music information retrieval applications.

Abstract: The emotional content of song lyrics plays a pivotal role in shaping listener
experiences and influencing musical preferences. This paper investigates the
task of multi-label emotional attribution of song lyrics by predicting six
emotional intensity scores corresponding to six fundamental emotions. A
manually labeled dataset is constructed using a mean opinion score (MOS)
approach, which aggregates annotations from multiple human raters to ensure
reliable ground-truth labels. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of several publicly available large language models
(LLMs) under zero-shot scenarios. Additionally, we fine-tune a BERT-based model
specifically for predicting multi-label emotion scores. Experimental results
reveal the relative strengths and limitations of zero-shot and fine-tuned
models in capturing the nuanced emotional content of lyrics. Our findings
highlight the potential of LLMs for emotion recognition in creative texts,
providing insights into model selection strategies for emotion-based music
information retrieval applications. The labeled dataset is available at

*Liang Zhang,Yuan Li,Shijie Zhang,Zheng Zhang,Xitong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAID is a novel framework that integrates textual and relational structure information for few-shot intent detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods through query-adaptive attention mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing intent detection methods focus only on textual data and neglect crucial structural information like query-query and query-answer relations in conversational systems.

Method: Proposes SAID framework that integrates textual and relational structure information in pretraining, with QueryAdapt mechanism that generates intent-specific relation tokens from learned relations for fine-grained knowledge transfer.

Result: Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show SAID significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed SAID framework successfully captures both textual and structural information, demonstrating superior performance in few-shot intent detection tasks.

Abstract: Intent detection is a crucial component of modern conversational systems,
since accurately identifying user intent at the beginning of a conversation is
essential for generating effective responses. Recent efforts have focused on
studying this problem under a challenging few-shot scenario. These approaches
primarily leverage large-scale unlabeled dialogue text corpora to pretrain
language models through various pretext tasks, followed by fine-tuning for
intent detection with very limited annotations. Despite the improvements
achieved, existing methods have predominantly focused on textual data,
neglecting to effectively capture the crucial structural information inherent
in conversational systems, such as the query-query relation and query-answer
relation. To address this gap, we propose SAID, a novel framework that
integrates both textual and relational structure information in a unified
manner for model pretraining for the first time. Building on this framework, we
further propose a novel mechanism, the query-adaptive attention network
(QueryAdapt), which operates at the relation token level by generating
intent-specific relation tokens from well-learned query-query and query-answer
relations explicitly, enabling more fine-grained knowledge transfer. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that SAID
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LM-Searcher is a novel LLM-based framework for cross-domain neural architecture search that uses universal numerical encoding (NCode) and reformulates NAS as a ranking task, achieving competitive performance without domain-specific tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven NAS approaches require heavy prompt engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and scalability across diverse optimization tasks.

Method: Proposes NCode universal numerical representation for architectures, reformulates NAS as ranking task, uses instruction-tuning with pruning-based subspace sampling, and creates a comprehensive dataset of architecture-performance pairs.

Result: Achieves competitive performance in both in-domain (CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (LoRA configurations for segmentation/generation) tasks.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search without extensive domain adaptation, with datasets and models to be publicly released.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for
solving complex optimization problems, including Neural Architecture Search
(NAS). However, existing LLM-driven NAS approaches rely heavily on prompt
engineering and domain-specific tuning, limiting their practicality and
scalability across diverse tasks. In this work, we propose LM-Searcher, a novel
framework that leverages LLMs for cross-domain neural architecture optimization
without the need for extensive domain-specific adaptation. Central to our
approach is NCode, a universal numerical string representation for neural
architectures, which enables cross-domain architecture encoding and search. We
also reformulate the NAS problem as a ranking task, training LLMs to select
high-performing architectures from candidate pools using instruction-tuning
samples derived from a novel pruning-based subspace sampling strategy. Our
curated dataset, encompassing a wide range of architecture-performance pairs,
encourages robust and transferable learning. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that LM-Searcher achieves competitive performance in both in-domain
(e.g., CNNs for image classification) and out-of-domain (e.g., LoRA
configurations for segmentation and generation) tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for flexible and generalizable LLM-based architecture search. The
datasets and models will be released at https://github.com/Ashone3/LM-Searcher.

*Hong Su*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Extends method reuse beyond high-similarity questions to handle low-similarity and hidden-similarity cases by separating questions from solutions and guiding LLMs to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing method reuse approaches require highly similar questions, limiting their applicability. The paper aims to extend method reuse to questions with low similarity or hidden similarities that aren't explicitly observable.

Method: Separate questions and solutions rather than feeding them as pairs to LLMs. Guide LLMs to adapt solutions to new but related questions, focusing on solution transfer. Extend to cases with partial feature sharing or hidden characteristics.

Result: Experimental verification shows the scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable solutions, improving cross-question method reuse effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully extends method reuse beyond conventional similarity constraints, enabling broader application of LLM-assisted solution finding across questions with varying similarity levels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to assist in finding
solutions for diverse questions. Prior work has proposed representing a method
as a pair of a question and its corresponding solution, enabling method reuse.
However, existing approaches typically require the questions to be highly
similar. In this paper, we extend the scope of method reuse to address
questions with low similarity or with hidden similarities that are not
explicitly observable. For questions that are similar in a general-specific
sense (i.e., broader or narrower in scope), we propose to first separate the
question and solution, rather than directly feeding the pair to the LLM. The
LLM is then guided to adapt the solution to new but related questions, allowing
it to focus on solution transfer rather than question recognition. Furthermore,
we extend this approach to cases where questions only share partial features or
hidden characteristics. This enables cross-question method reuse beyond
conventional similarity constraints. Experimental verification shows that our
scope-extension approach increases the probability of filtering out reusable
solutions, thereby improving the effectiveness of cross-question method reuse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address English-centric bias in large language models and support low-resource languages like Bavarian while serving the German NLP community.

Method: Continuous pretraining on Llama 3.1-8B with 164B tokens (balanced English/German/Bavarian), unified tokenizer creation, architecture optimization, and development of trilingual evaluation suite.

Result: Achieves strong cross-lingual performance, surpasses Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian, outperforms EuroLLM in English, matches EuroLLM in German, and demonstrates efficient multilingual training.

Conclusion: Provides a blueprint for inclusive foundation models that successfully integrate low-resource languages while maintaining strong performance across multiple languages.

Abstract: We present Llama-GENBA-10B, a trilingual foundation model addressing
English-centric bias in large language models. Built on Llama 3.1-8B and scaled
to 10B parameters, Llama-GENBA-10B is continuously pretrained on 164B tokens
(82B English, 82B German, and 80M Bavarian), balancing resources while
preventing English dominance. Targeted at the German NLP community, the model
also promotes Bavarian as a low-resource language. Development tackled four
challenges: (1) curating a multilingual corpus despite Bavarian scarcity, (2)
creating a unified tokenizer for English, German, and Bavarian, (3) optimizing
architecture and language-ratio hyperparameters for cross-lingual transfer, and
(4) establishing the first standardized trilingual evaluation suite by
translating German benchmarks into Bavarian. Evaluations show that
Llama-GENBA-10B achieves strong cross-lingual performance, with the fine-tuned
variant surpassing Apertus-8B-2509 and gemma-2-9b in Bavarian and establishing
itself as the best model in its class for this language, while also
outperforming EuroLLM in English and matching its results in German. Training
on the Cerebras CS-2 demonstrated efficient large-scale multilingual
pretraining with documented energy use, offering a blueprint for inclusive
foundation models that integrate low-resource languages.

*Ningyuan Deng,Hanyu Duan,Yixuan Tang,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Text embedding models struggle to accurately capture numerical nuances in text, despite being widely used in domains where numbers matter like finance and healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embedding models are increasingly applied in numerical domains but their capability to encode precise numerical information remains unclear, as current benchmarks don't test numerical understanding adequately.

Method: Evaluated 13 widely used text embedding models using synthetic data in a financial context to test their ability to capture numerical details accurately.

Result: Most embedding models generally struggle to capture numerical nuances accurately, failing to distinguish between similar numerical contexts with different values.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant limitations in current embedding models' numeracy capabilities, highlighting the need for future research to improve numerical content handling in embedding-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Text embedding models are widely used in natural language processing
applications. However, their capability is often benchmarked on tasks that do
not require understanding nuanced numerical information in text. As a result,
it remains unclear whether current embedding models can precisely encode
numerical content, such as numbers, into embeddings. This question is critical
because embedding models are increasingly applied in domains where numbers
matter, such as finance and healthcare. For example, Company X's market share
grew by 2\% should be interpreted very differently from Company X's market
share grew by 20\%, even though both indicate growth in market share. This
study aims to examine whether text embedding models can capture such nuances.
Using synthetic data in a financial context, we evaluate 13 widely used text
embedding models and find that they generally struggle to capture numerical
details accurately. Our further analyses provide deeper insights into embedding
numeracy, informing future research to strengthen embedding model-based NLP
systems with improved capacity for handling numerical content.

### [23] [Exploring Subjective Tasks in Farsi: A Survey Analysis and Evaluation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05719)
*Donya Rooein,Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco,Debora Nozza,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Farsi's classification as a middle-resource language is misleading - despite having millions of speakers and Wikipedia articles, it faces severe data scarcity and quality issues for subjective NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, and toxicity detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the perception of Farsi as a middle-resource language by examining the actual availability and quality of datasets for subjective NLP tasks, given the language's large speaker base and digital text availability.

Method: Reviewed 110 publications on subjective tasks in Farsi, analyzed dataset availability and quality, and evaluated prediction models using the few available datasets to assess stability across datasets and models.

Result: Found significant challenges: lack of publicly available datasets, existing datasets often missing crucial demographic factors (age, gender), and highly unstable model performance across both datasets and models.

Conclusion: Data volume alone is insufficient to improve a language's NLP prospects; Farsi remains low-resource for subjective tasks despite surface-level metrics suggesting otherwise, highlighting the need for better dataset quality and availability.

Abstract: Given Farsi's speaker base of over 127 million people and the growing
availability of digital text, including more than 1.3 million articles on
Wikipedia, it is considered a middle-resource language. However, this label
quickly crumbles when the situation is examined more closely. We focus on three
subjective tasks (Sentiment Analysis, Emotion Analysis, and Toxicity Detection)
and find significant challenges in data availability and quality, despite the
overall increase in data availability. We review 110 publications on subjective
tasks in Farsi and observe a lack of publicly available datasets. Furthermore,
existing datasets often lack essential demographic factors, such as age and
gender, that are crucial for accurately modeling subjectivity in language. When
evaluating prediction models using the few available datasets, the results are
highly unstable across both datasets and models. Our findings indicate that the
volume of data is insufficient to significantly improve a language's prospects
in NLP.

TL;DR: QCSE is a pretrained quantum context-sensitive embedding model that uses quantum computation to capture contextual word relationships through five innovative context matrix computation methods, demonstrating effectiveness on both low-resource Fulani and English datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage quantum computation for natural language processing by capturing context-sensitive word embeddings and addressing data scarcity issues in low-resource languages through quantum-native approaches.

Method: Developed QCSE model with quantum-native context learning using five distinct context matrix computation methods (exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, hash-based transformations) to create unique context-aware word representations.

Result: QCSE successfully captures context sensitivity and leverages quantum system expressibility for rich language representation, demonstrating effectiveness on both Fulani (low-resource language) and English datasets.

Conclusion: Quantum computation shows strong potential for NLP applications, particularly in addressing data scarcity for low-resource languages, opening new avenues for QNLP in real-world linguistic challenges.

Abstract: Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
encoding and understanding the complexity of natural languages through the
power of quantum computation. This paper presents a pretrained quantum
context-sensitive embedding model, called QCSE, that captures context-sensitive
word embeddings, leveraging the unique properties of quantum systems to learn
contextual relationships in languages. The model introduces quantum-native
context learning, enabling the utilization of quantum computers for linguistic
tasks. Central to the proposed approach are innovative context matrix
computation methods, designed to create unique, representations of words based
on their surrounding linguistic context. Five distinct methods are proposed and
tested for computing the context matrices, incorporating techniques such as
exponential decay, sinusoidal modulation, phase shifts, and hash-based
transformations. These methods ensure that the quantum embeddings retain
context sensitivity, thereby making them suitable for downstream language tasks
where the expressibility and properties of quantum systems are valuable
resources. To evaluate the effectiveness of the model and the associated
context matrix methods, evaluations are conducted on both a Fulani corpus, a
low-resource African language, dataset of small size and an English corpus of
slightly larger size. The results demonstrate that QCSE not only captures
context sensitivity but also leverages the expressibility of quantum systems
for representing rich, context-aware language information. The use of Fulani
further highlights the potential of QNLP to mitigate the problem of lack of
data for this category of languages. This work underscores the power of quantum
computation in natural language processing (NLP) and opens new avenues for
applying QNLP to real-world linguistic challenges across various tasks and
domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a text-to-speech model that can maintain the source speaker's voice identity when translating speech across different languages, particularly focusing on English and Romance languages with emphasis on Portuguese.

Method: 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in three stages: pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, supervised fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and DPO alignment using automatically labeled pairs based on WER and speaker-similarity metrics.

Result: LatinX with DPO consistently reduces Word Error Rate and improves objective speaker similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human evaluations show stronger perceived speaker similarity than XTTSv2 baseline, revealing gaps between objective and subjective measures.

Conclusion: The model successfully preserves speaker identity across languages, with DPO optimization proving effective. Future work includes cross-lingual analyses, balanced preference signals, and lower-latency architectures.

Abstract: We present LatinX, a multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) model for cascaded
speech-to-speech translation that preserves the source speaker's identity
across languages. LatinX is a 12-layer decoder-only Transformer trained in
three stages: (i) pre-training for text-to-audio mapping, (ii) supervised
fine-tuning for zero-shot voice cloning, and (iii) alignment with Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) using automatically labeled pairs based on Word
Error Rate (WER) and speaker-similarity metrics. Trained on English and Romance
languages with emphasis on Portuguese, LatinX with DPO consistently reduces WER
and improves objective similarity over the fine-tuned baseline. Human
evaluations further indicate stronger perceived speaker similarity than a
strong baseline (XTTSv2), revealing gaps between objective and subjective
measures. We provide cross-lingual analyses and discuss balanced preference

TL;DR: ZhiFangDanTai framework combines GraphRAG with LLM fine-tuning to generate comprehensive TCM formulas with detailed explanations, reducing errors and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TCM models lack comprehensive formula details and explanations, and current datasets are insufficient for deep model outputs in traditional Chinese medicine applications.

Method: Proposed ZhiFangDanTai framework using Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) to retrieve structured TCM knowledge and fine-tune LLMs with enhanced instruction datasets.

Result: Experimental results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art models on both collected and clinical datasets, with reduced generalization error and hallucination rates.

Conclusion: The integration of GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques effectively enhances TCM formula generation with comprehensive details and explanations, demonstrating superior performance in clinical applications.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulas play a significant role in
treating epidemics and complex diseases. Existing models for TCM utilize
traditional algorithms or deep learning techniques to analyze formula
relationships, yet lack comprehensive results, such as complete formula
compositions and detailed explanations. Although recent efforts have used TCM
instruction datasets to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable
formula generation, existing datasets lack sufficient details, such as the
roles of the formula's sovereign, minister, assistant, courier; efficacy;
contraindications; tongue and pulse diagnosis-limiting the depth of model
outputs. To address these challenges, we propose ZhiFangDanTai, a framework
combining Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) with LLM
fine-tuning. ZhiFangDanTai uses GraphRAG to retrieve and synthesize structured
TCM knowledge into concise summaries, while also constructing an enhanced
instruction dataset to improve LLMs' ability to integrate retrieved
information. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical proofs demonstrating
that integrating GraphRAG with fine-tuning techniques can reduce generalization
error and hallucination rates in the TCM formula task. Experimental results on
both collected and clinical datasets demonstrate that ZhiFangDanTai achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. Our model is

Motivation: Expert review of LLM-generated clinical text is unscalable for continuous quality assurance, creating a critical barrier to adoption of AI in clinical workflows.

Method: Two complementary approaches: MedFactEval framework with clinician-defined key facts and multi-LLM majority voting (LLM Jury), and MedAgentBrief multi-step workflow for generating factual discharge summaries.

Result: MedFactEval LLM Jury achieved almost perfect agreement with 7-physician panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), statistically non-inferior to single human expert performance (kappa=67%, P<0.001).

Conclusion: Provides both robust evaluation framework and high-performing generation workflow for responsible deployment of generative AI in clinical settings.

Abstract: Evaluating factual accuracy in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated clinical
text is a critical barrier to adoption, as expert review is unscalable for the
continuous quality assurance these systems require. We address this challenge
with two complementary contributions. First, we introduce MedFactEval, a
framework for scalable, fact-grounded evaluation where clinicians define
high-salience key facts and an "LLM Jury"--a multi-LLM majority vote--assesses
their inclusion in generated summaries. Second, we present MedAgentBrief, a
model-agnostic, multi-step workflow designed to generate high-quality, factual
discharge summaries. To validate our evaluation framework, we established a
gold-standard reference using a seven-physician majority vote on
clinician-defined key facts from inpatient cases. The MedFactEval LLM Jury
achieved almost perfect agreement with this panel (Cohen's kappa=81%), a
performance statistically non-inferior to that of a single human expert
(kappa=67%, P < 0.001). Our work provides both a robust evaluation framework
(MedFactEval) and a high-performing generation workflow (MedAgentBrief),
offering a comprehensive approach to advance the responsible deployment of
generative AI in clinical workflows.

*Abhijnan Nath,Carine Graff,Nikhil Krishnaswamy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness in multiturn, multiparty collaborations, focusing on friction agents that encourage reflection in group dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become AI collaborators, their behavior in multiturn interactions must be predictable and reliable. Current alignment techniques don't account for long-horizon multiparty interaction dynamics.

Method: Using roleplay methodology, the study evaluates interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task conversations. A novel counterfactual evaluation framework quantifies how friction interventions change group collaboration trajectories and belief alignment.

Result: Friction-aware approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping convergence to common ground and correctness of task outcomes.

Conclusion: Specialized alignment approaches that account for multiparty interaction dynamics are needed for reliable AI collaboration in group settings.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into diverse workflows, they are
increasingly being considered "collaborators" with humans. If such AI
collaborators are to be reliable, their behavior over multiturn interactions
must be predictable, validated and verified before deployment. Common alignment
techniques are typically developed under simplified single-user settings and do
not account for the dynamics of long-horizon multiparty interactions. This
paper examines how different alignment methods affect LLM agents' effectiveness
as partners in multiturn, multiparty collaborations. We study this question
through the lens of friction agents that intervene in group dialogues to
encourage the collaborative group to slow down and reflect upon their reasoning
for deliberative decision-making. Using a roleplay methodology, we evaluate
interventions from differently-trained friction agents in collaborative task
conversations. We propose a novel counterfactual evaluation framework that
quantifies how friction interventions change the trajectory of group
collaboration and belief alignment. Our results show that a friction-aware
approach significantly outperforms common alignment baselines in helping both
convergence to a common ground, or agreed-upon task-relevant propositions, and
correctness of task outcomes.

### [30] [Enhancing the Robustness of Contextual ASR to Varying Biasing Information Volumes Through Purified Semantic Correlation Joint Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05908)
*Yue Gu,Zhihao Du,Ying Shi,Shiliang Zhang,Qian Chen,Jiqing Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes PSC-Joint approach to improve contextual ASR by identifying and integrating only the most relevant biasing information rather than entire biasing lists, addressing performance degradation with increasing list lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-attention based contextual ASR models struggle with performance when biasing list length increases significantly, as only limited biasing information is relevant to specific ASR intermediate representations.

Method: Purified Semantic Correlation Joint Modeling (PSC-Joint) that calculates three semantic correlations (list-level, phrase-level, token-level) between ASR representations and biasing information, jointly models them to highlight most relevant information, and uses purification mechanism with grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter irrelevant phrases.

Result: Achieves average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46% on KeSpeech across biasing lists of varying lengths compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The PSC-Joint approach effectively addresses performance degradation in contextual ASR with long biasing lists by selectively integrating only the most relevant biasing information across multiple granularities while reducing computational costs.

Abstract: Recently, cross-attention-based contextual automatic speech recognition (ASR)
models have made notable advancements in recognizing personalized biasing
phrases. However, the effectiveness of cross-attention is affected by
variations in biasing information volume, especially when the length of the
biasing list increases significantly. We find that, regardless of the length of
the biasing list, only a limited amount of biasing information is most relevant
to a specific ASR intermediate representation. Therefore, by identifying and
integrating the most relevant biasing information rather than the entire
biasing list, we can alleviate the effects of variations in biasing information
volume for contextual ASR. To this end, we propose a purified semantic
correlation joint modeling (PSC-Joint) approach. In PSC-Joint, we define and
calculate three semantic correlations between the ASR intermediate
representations and biasing information from coarse to fine: list-level,
phrase-level, and token-level. Then, the three correlations are jointly modeled
to produce their intersection, so that the most relevant biasing information
across various granularities is highlighted and integrated for contextual
recognition. In addition, to reduce the computational cost introduced by the
joint modeling of three semantic correlations, we also propose a purification
mechanism based on a grouped-and-competitive strategy to filter out irrelevant
biasing phrases. Compared with baselines, our PSC-Joint approach achieves
average relative F1 score improvements of up to 21.34% on AISHELL-1 and 28.46%
on KeSpeech, across biasing lists of varying lengths.

*Sangmin Bae*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This dissertation resolves the conflict between adaptive computation's computational savings and system-level bottlenecks in LLMs through co-designed algorithms and architectures that optimize both dynamism and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have high computational costs that hinder practical deployment. While adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise cost reduction, they create system-level bottlenecks that paradoxically reduce throughput in batched inference.

Method: Proposes efficient parallel decoding to address overhead in conventional early-exiting, uses deep parameter sharing to mitigate synchronization issues, and develops lightweight pretrained routers to dynamically assign optimal recursion depth per token.

Result: Establishes a new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively optimizing both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a single model.

Conclusion: The co-design of adaptive algorithms and model architectures successfully resolves the fundamental conflict between computational dynamism and system efficiency in large language model deployment.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their
practical deployment is hindered by significant computational costs. While
adaptive computation methods like early-exiting promise to reduce these costs,
they introduce a fundamental conflict: the per-token dynamism intended to save
computation often creates system-level bottlenecks that can paradoxically
reduce throughput in batched inference. This dissertation resolves this
conflict by co-designing adaptive algorithms and model architectures to strike
an optimal balance between dynamism and efficiency. To this end, our work first
addresses critical sources of overhead in conventional early-exiting by
proposing an efficient parallel decoding mechanism. We then show that deep
parameter sharing provides an architectural foundation that not only yields
compact, parameter-efficient models but also inherently mitigates the critical
synchronization issues affecting dynamic inference. Finally, this work presents
a unified framework where lightweight routers are pretrained to dynamically
assign an optimal recursion depth for each token. This approach establishes a
new Pareto frontier between efficiency and performance by effectively
optimizing for both adaptive computation and parameter efficiency within a
single model.

TL;DR: KatotohananQA is a Filipino translation of TruthfulQA benchmark that reveals significant performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness in LLMs, with newer OpenAI models showing better multilingual robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from hallucinations and while benchmarks like TruthfulQA exist to measure truthfulness, they are primarily available in English, creating a gap in evaluating LLMs in low-resource languages like Filipino.

Method: Created KatotohananQA (Filipino translation of TruthfulQA) and evaluated seven free-tier proprietary models using a binary-choice framework to assess truthfulness in Filipino.

Result: Significant performance gap between English and Filipino truthfulness was found. Newer OpenAI models (GPT-5 and GPT-5 mini) showed strong multilingual robustness. Disparities were observed across question characteristics, with some types/categories/topics being less robust to multilingual transfer.

Conclusion: There is a need for broader multilingual evaluation to ensure fairness and reliability in LLM usage, as question characteristics affect multilingual robustness differently.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance across various
tasks, but their tendency to produce hallucinations limits reliable adoption.
Benchmarks such as TruthfulQA have been developed to measure truthfulness, yet

*Zhenqi Jia,Rui Liu,Berrak Sisman,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MFCIG-CSS proposes a multimodal fine-grained context interaction graph approach for conversational speech synthesis that captures word-level semantic and prosodic interactions from dialogue history to generate more natural prosody.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CSS methods only model utterance-level interactions and overlook fine-grained semantic and prosodic knowledge at the word level in multimodal dialogue history, limiting prosody naturalness.

Method: Constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue interaction graphs (semantic and prosody graphs) to encode word-level interactions between semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances.

Result: Experiments on DailyTalk dataset show MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in prosodic expressiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed fine-grained interaction graph approach effectively captures word-level semantic and prosodic interactions, leading to more natural conversational prosody in synthesized speech.

Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to generate speech with natural
prosody by understanding the multimodal dialogue history (MDH). The latest work
predicts the accurate prosody expression of the target utterance by modeling
the utterance-level interaction characteristics of MDH and the target
utterance. However, MDH contains fine-grained semantic and prosody knowledge at
the word level. Existing methods overlook the fine-grained semantic and
prosodic interaction modeling. To address this gap, we propose MFCIG-CSS, a
novel Multimodal Fine-grained Context Interaction Graph-based CSS system. Our
approach constructs two specialized multimodal fine-grained dialogue
interaction graphs: a semantic interaction graph and a prosody interaction
graph. These two interaction graphs effectively encode interactions between
word-level semantics, prosody, and their influence on subsequent utterances in
MDH. The encoded interaction features are then leveraged to enhance synthesized
speech with natural conversational prosody. Experiments on the DailyTalk
dataset demonstrate that MFCIG-CSS outperforms all baseline models in terms of
prosodic expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at

TL;DR: OLieRA introduces Lie group theory to LLM fine-tuning, using multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry while enforcing orthogonality constraints, achieving SOTA results on continual learning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter regularization methods for LLMs overlook the disruption of intrinsic geometric structure caused by conventional additive fine-tuning, limiting performance in sequential multi-task settings.

Method: Proposes Orthogonal Low-rank Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA) that leverages multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces.

Result: OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of Tasks setting.

Conclusion: Preserving the geometric structure of LLM parameters through Lie group theory and multiplicative updates, in addition to enforcing orthogonality, significantly improves continual learning performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to catastrophic forgetting in
sequential multi-task settings. Parameter regularization methods such as O-LoRA
and N-LoRA alleviate task interference by enforcing low-rank subspace
orthogonality, but they overlook the fact that conventional additive
fine-tuning disrupts the intrinsic geometric structure of LLM parameters,
limiting performance. Our key insight is that the parameter space of LLMs
possesses a geometric structure, which must be preserved in addition to
enforcing orthogonality. Based on this, we propose Orthogonal Low-rank
Adaptation in Lie Groups (OLieRA), which introduces Lie group theory into LLM
fine-tuning: leveraging multiplicative updates to preserve parameter geometry
while applying orthogonality constraints to task subspaces. Experiments
demonstrate that OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art results on the Standard CL
benchmark and remains among the top-performing methods in the Large Number of
Tasks setting.

TL;DR: EuroParlVote is a new benchmark for evaluating LLM bias in political contexts using European Parliament data, revealing gender misclassification and political group biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a comprehensive benchmark for assessing large language model biases in politically sensitive domains, particularly focusing on gender and political orientation in European parliamentary contexts.

Method: Developed EuroParlVote dataset linking debate speeches to vote outcomes with demographic metadata, then evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs on gender classification and vote prediction tasks.

Result: LLMs consistently misclassify female MEPs as male, show reduced accuracy for female speakers' vote predictions, favor centrist political groups while underperforming on far-left/right groups, with proprietary models outperforming open-weight alternatives.

Conclusion: The study reveals systematic biases in LLMs within political contexts and releases the dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness and accountability in political NLP applications.

Abstract: We introduce EuroParlVote, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) in politically sensitive contexts. It links European Parliament
debate speeches to roll-call vote outcomes and includes rich demographic
metadata for each Member of the European Parliament (MEP), such as gender, age,
country, and political group. Using EuroParlVote, we evaluate state-of-the-art
LLMs on two tasks -- gender classification and vote prediction -- revealing
consistent patterns of bias. We find that LLMs frequently misclassify female
MEPs as male and demonstrate reduced accuracy when simulating votes for female
speakers. Politically, LLMs tend to favor centrist groups while underperforming
on both far-left and far-right ones. Proprietary models like GPT-4o outperform
open-weight alternatives in terms of both robustness and fairness. We release
the EuroParlVote dataset, code, and demo to support future research on fairness
and accountability in NLP within political contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic data from LLMs improves embedding models but benefits are sparse and localized, with trade-offs between different tasks rather than general robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of publicly available synthetic datasets for studying text embedder generalization and understand where synthetic data actually improves model performance.

Method: Reproduced and publicly released synthetic data from Mistral-E5, then critically analyzed where synthetic data improves model generalization across different datasets and tasks.

Result: Synthetic data leads to consistent performance improvements but benefits are sparse and highly localized to individual datasets, with trade-offs between different task categories.

Conclusion: Current synthetic data approaches have limitations for building general-purpose embedders and do not necessarily lead to more robust embedding models across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in developing general purpose text embedders has been driven
by training on ever-growing corpora of synthetic LLM-generated data.
Nonetheless, no publicly available synthetic dataset exists, posing a barrier
to studying its role for generalization. To address this issue, we first
reproduce and publicly release the synthetic data proposed by Wang et al.
(Mistral-E5). Our synthetic data is high quality and leads to consistent
improvements in performance. Next, we critically examine where exactly
synthetic data improves model generalization. Our analysis reveals that
benefits from synthetic data are sparse and highly localized to individual
datasets. Moreover, we observe trade-offs between the performance on different
categories and data that benefits one task, degrades performance on another.
Our findings highlight the limitations of current synthetic data approaches for
building general-purpose embedders and challenge the notion that training on
synthetic data leads to more robust embedding models across tasks.

TL;DR: Mask-GCG improves jailbreak attacks on LLMs by using learnable token masking to identify and prune redundant tokens in fixed-length suffixes, reducing computational overhead while maintaining attack success rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing jailbreak attack methods like GCG and its variants use fixed-length suffixes, but the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains unexplored, leading to unnecessary computational costs.

Method: Proposes Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within suffixes. It increases update probability for high-impact tokens while pruning low-impact ones, reducing gradient space size.

Result: Experimental results show most tokens contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning minority low-impact tokens doesn't affect loss values or attack success rate, revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.

Conclusion: The approach reduces computational overhead and attack time while maintaining effectiveness, providing insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs from jailbreak attack perspectives.

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated various
successful methods whereby attackers manipulate models into generating harmful
responses that they are designed to avoid. Among these, Greedy Coordinate
Gradient (GCG) has emerged as a general and effective approach that optimizes
the tokens in a suffix to generate jailbreakable prompts. While several
improved variants of GCG have been proposed, they all rely on fixed-length
suffixes. However, the potential redundancy within these suffixes remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose Mask-GCG, a plug-and-play method that
employs learnable token masking to identify impactful tokens within the suffix.
Our approach increases the update probability for tokens at high-impact
positions while pruning those at low-impact positions. This pruning not only
reduces redundancy but also decreases the size of the gradient space, thereby
lowering computational overhead and shortening the time required to achieve
successful attacks compared to GCG. We evaluate Mask-GCG by applying it to the
original GCG and several improved variants. Experimental results show that most
tokens in the suffix contribute significantly to attack success, and pruning a
minority of low-impact tokens does not affect the loss values or compromise the
attack success rate (ASR), thereby revealing token redundancy in LLM prompts.
Our findings provide insights for developing efficient and interpretable LLMs
from the perspective of jailbreak attacks.

TL;DR: PL-CA introduces a parametric RAG framework that encodes legal knowledge into parametric vectors and integrates them into LLMs via LoRA, reducing context overhead while maintaining performance on legal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional RAG methods have limitations including context window constraints, computational overhead from long contexts, and inadequate benchmarks for real-world legal scenarios requiring multiple mixed tasks.

Method: Proposes PL-CA with parametric RAG framework that performs data augmentation on corpus knowledge, encodes legal knowledge into parametric vectors, and integrates this knowledge into LLM's feed-forward networks via LoRA.

Result: Experimental results show the method reduces overhead from excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive performance on downstream legal tasks compared to conventional RAG.

Conclusion: PL-CA effectively addresses limitations of conventional RAG in legal domains by reducing context pressure through parametric knowledge encoding while maintaining task performance, with expert-annotated multi-task dataset provided.

Abstract: Conventional RAG is considered one of the most effective methods for
addressing model knowledge insufficiency and hallucination, particularly in the
judicial domain that requires high levels of knowledge rigor, logical
consistency, and content integrity. However, the conventional RAG method only
injects retrieved documents directly into the model's context, which severely
constrains models due to their limited context windows and introduces
additional computational overhead through excessively long contexts, thereby
disrupting models' attention and degrading performance on downstream tasks.
Moreover, many existing benchmarks lack expert annotation and focus solely on
individual downstream tasks while real-world legal scenarios consist of
multiple mixed legal tasks, indicating conventional benchmarks' inadequacy for
reflecting models' true capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose
PL-CA, which introduces a parametric RAG (P-RAG) framework to perform data
augmentation on corpus knowledge and encode this legal knowledge into
parametric vectors, and then integrates this parametric knowledge into the
LLM's feed-forward networks (FFN) via LoRA, thereby alleviating models' context
pressure. Additionally, we also construct a multi-task legal dataset comprising
more than 2000 training and test instances, which are all expert-annotated and
manually verified. We conduct our experiments on our dataset, and the
experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the overhead
associated with excessively long contexts while maintaining competitive
performance on downstream tasks compared to conventional RAG. Our code and
dataset are provided in the appendix.

Motivation: To investigate multilingual commonsense generation capabilities of LLMs across languages with varying resource availability.

Method: Created MULTICOM benchmark extending COCOTEROS to 4 languages, evaluated open-source LLMs using automatic metrics, LLM-as-judge approaches (Prometheus, JudgeLM), and human annotations.

Result: Consistent superior performance in English, significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. Contextual support showed mixed results but tended to benefit underrepresented languages.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in multilingual commonsense generation, particularly for less-resourced languages, highlighting the need for improved multilingual capabilities.

Abstract: This paper explores the multilingual commonsense generation abilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate this investigation, we introduce
MULTICOM, a novel benchmark that extends the COCOTEROS dataset to four
languages: English, Spanish, Dutch, and Valencian. The task involves generating
a commonsensical sentence that includes a given triplet of words. We evaluate a
range of open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen, Gemma, EuroLLM, and
Salamandra, on this benchmark. Our evaluation combines automatic metrics,
LLM-as-a-judge approaches (using Prometheus and JudgeLM), and human
annotations. Results consistently show superior performance in English, with
significantly lower performance in less-resourced languages. While contextual
support yields mixed results, it tends to benefit underrepresented languages.
These findings underscore the current limitations of LLMs in multilingual

TL;DR: WebExplorer introduces a systematic data generation approach using model-based exploration and query evolution to create challenging web navigation tasks, enabling development of state-of-the-art 8B parameter web agent that outperforms much larger models on information-seeking benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-source web agents have limited information-seeking abilities on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations, with the key challenge being scarcity of challenging data for information seeking.

Method: Systematic data generation using model-based exploration and iterative long-to-short query evolution to create challenging query-answer pairs requiring multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: WebExplorer-8B achieves state-of-the-art performance at its scale, supporting 128K context length and up to 100 tool calling turns. It outperforms WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and achieves best performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES, with strong generalization on HLE benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical path toward long-horizon web agents, demonstrating that high-quality challenging data generation enables development of effective web navigation capabilities even with smaller model sizes.

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increasingly shifted toward
agentic applications, where web browsing capabilities are fundamental for
retrieving information from diverse online sources. However, existing
open-source web agents either demonstrate limited information-seeking abilities
on complex tasks or lack transparent implementations. In this work, we identify
that the key challenge lies in the scarcity of challenging data for information
seeking. To address this limitation, we introduce WebExplorer: a systematic
data generation approach using model-based exploration and iterative,
long-to-short query evolution. This method creates challenging query-answer
pairs that require multi-step reasoning and complex web navigation. By
leveraging our curated high-quality dataset, we successfully develop advanced
web agent WebExplorer-8B through supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning. Our model supports 128K context length and up to 100
tool calling turns, enabling long-horizon problem solving. Across diverse
information-seeking benchmarks, WebExplorer-8B achieves the state-of-the-art
performance at its scale. Notably, as an 8B-sized model, WebExplorer-8B is able
to effectively search over an average of 16 turns after RL training, achieving
higher accuracy than WebSailor-72B on BrowseComp-en/zh and attaining the best
performance among models up to 100B parameters on WebWalkerQA and FRAMES.
Beyond these information-seeking tasks, our model also achieves strong
generalization on the HLE benchmark even though it is only trained on
knowledge-intensive QA data. These results highlight our approach as a
practical path toward long-horizon web agents.

*Andrei Baroian,Kasper Notebomer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Layer-Wise Scaling variants redistribute FFN widths and attention heads using linear interpolation during pre-training, achieving better performance than isotropic baselines with similar parameter budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional transformer models use uniform layer sizes, ignoring the diverse functional roles and computational capacity needs at different depths.

Method: Three new LWS variants (Framed, Reverse, Crown) that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two or three-point linear interpolation during pre-training, tested on 180M parameters trained on 5B tokens.

Result: All models converge to similar losses and achieve better performance compared to equal-cost isotropic baseline, without substantial decrease in training throughput.

Conclusion: This represents an initial step into layer-wise architecture design for pre-training, but future work needs larger scale experiments to fully assess potential.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models traditionally use uniform (isotropic) layer
sizes, yet they ignore the diverse functional roles that different depths can
play and their computational capacity needs. Building on Layer-Wise Scaling
(LWS) and pruning literature, we introduce three new LWS variants - Framed,
Reverse, and Crown - that redistribute FFN widths and attention heads via two
or three-point linear interpolation in the pre-training stage. We present the
first systematic ablation of LWS and its variants, on a fixed budget of 180M
parameters, trained on 5B tokens. All models converge to similar losses and
achieve better performance compared to an equal-cost isotropic baseline,
without a substantial decrease in training throughput. This work represents an
initial step into the design space of layer-wise architectures for
pre-training, but future work should scale experiments to orders of magnitude
more tokens and parameters to fully assess their potential.

### [46] [LAMDAS: LLM as an Implicit Classifier for Domain-specific Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06524)
*Jian Wu,Hang Yu,Bingchang Liu,Wenjie Yang,Peng Di,Jianguo Li,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAMDAS uses LLMs as implicit classifiers for domain-specific data selection, outperforming full-data training and 9 SOTA baselines with better computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain adaptation of LLMs faces data scarcity issues, and existing data selection methods struggle to balance accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Reframes data selection as one-class classification using pre-trained LLM as implicit classifier, avoiding explicit feature engineering and intensive optimization.

Result: Exceeds full-data training performance using fraction of data, outperforms 9 SOTA baselines across various scenarios.

Conclusion: LAMDAS achieves optimal balance between performance gains and computational efficiency for domain-specific data selection.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific domains often faces a
critical bottleneck: the scarcity of high-quality, human-curated data. While
large volumes of unchecked data are readily available, indiscriminately using
them for fine-tuning risks introducing noise and degrading performance.
Strategic data selection is thus crucial, requiring a method that is both
accurate and efficient. Existing approaches, categorized as similarity-based
and direct optimization methods, struggle to simultaneously achieve these
goals. In this paper, we introduce LAMDAS (LLM As an iMplicit classifier for
domain-specific DAta Selection), a novel approach that leverages the
pre-trained LLM itself as an implicit classifier, thereby bypassing explicit
feature engineering and computationally intensive optimization process. LAMDAS
reframes data selection as a one-class classification problem, identifying
candidate data that "belongs" to the target domain defined by a small reference
dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LAMDAS not only
exceeds the performance of full-data training using a fraction of the data but
also outperforms nine state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines under various
scenarios. Furthermore, LAMDAS achieves the most compelling balance between
performance gains and computational efficiency compared to all evaluated
baselines.

*Mengxue Yang,Chun Yang,Jiaqi Zhu,Jiafan Li,Jingqi Zhang,Yuyang Li,Ying Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLiNT is a modular framework that injects knowledge graph structural context into frozen LLMs using LoRA adaptation for improved link prediction, addressing structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have strong generative reasoning but limited structural signal exploitation, leading to structural sparsity and semantic ambiguity in knowledge graph link prediction, especially in incomplete or zero-shot settings.

Method: Proposes SLiNT framework with three components: Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (retrieves pseudo-neighbors), Dynamic Hard Contrastive Learning (fine-grained supervision with hard positives/negatives), and Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (token-level structure-aware intervention while preserving LLM parameters).

Result: Experiments on WN18RR and FB15k-237 show SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance compared to both embedding-based and generation-based baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for scalable knowledge graph completion through modular integration of structural context with frozen LLM backbone.

Abstract: Link prediction in knowledge graphs requires integrating structural
information and semantic context to infer missing entities. While large
language models offer strong generative reasoning capabilities, their limited
exploitation of structural signals often results in structural sparsity and
semantic ambiguity, especially under incomplete or zero-shot settings. To
address these challenges, we propose SLiNT (Structure-aware Language model with
Injection and coNtrastive Training), a modular framework that injects
knowledge-graph-derived structural context into a frozen LLM backbone with
lightweight LoRA-based adaptation for robust link prediction. Specifically,
Structure-Guided Neighborhood Enhancement (SGNE) retrieves pseudo-neighbors to
enrich sparse entities and mitigate missing context; Dynamic Hard Contrastive
Learning (DHCL) introduces fine-grained supervision by interpolating hard
positives and negatives to resolve entity-level ambiguity; and
Gradient-Decoupled Dual Injection (GDDI) performs token-level structure-aware
intervention while preserving the core LLM parameters. Experiments on WN18RR
and FB15k-237 show that SLiNT achieves superior or competitive performance
compared with both embedding-based and generation-based baselines,
demonstrating the effectiveness of structure-aware representation learning for
scalable knowledge graph completion.

### [48] [HAVE: Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration for Hallucination Mitigation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06596)
*Xin Tong,Zhi Lin,Jingya Wang,Bo Jin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HAVE is a parameter-free decoding framework that reduces hallucinations in LLMs by adaptively weighting attention heads and calibrating value vectors to better align evidence with model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce hallucinations in retrieval-augmented or long-context generation even when relevant evidence is present, due to input-agnostic head importance treatment and poor reflection of token contributions through raw attention weights.

Method: HAVE introduces head-adaptive gating (instance-level soft reweighing of attention heads) and value calibration (augmenting attention with value vector magnitude to approximate write-back contribution), fused with LM distribution through uncertainty-scaled policy in a single forward pass.

Result: Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks and LLM families show HAVE consistently reduces hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines including DAGCD with modest overhead.

Conclusion: HAVE provides an efficient, transparent, and reproducible framework that integrates with off-the-shelf LLMs without finetuning, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce hallucinations in
retrieval-augmented or long-context generation, even when relevant evidence is
present. This stems from two issues: head importance is treated as
input-agnostic, and raw attention weights poorly reflect each token's true
contribution. We present HAVE (Head-Adaptive Gating and ValuE Calibration), a
parameter-free decoding framework that directly addresses both challenges. HAVE
introduces head-adaptive gating, which performs instance-level soft reweighing
of attention heads, and value calibration, which augments attention with the
magnitude of value vectors to approximate write-back contribution. Together,
these modules construct token-level evidence aligned with model updates and
fuse it with the LM distribution through a lightweight uncertainty-scaled
policy. HAVE requires no finetuning and operates in a single forward pass,
making it efficient and broadly applicable. Experiments across multiple QA
benchmarks and LLM families demonstrate that HAVE consistently reduces
hallucinations and outperforms strong baselines, including DAGCD, with modest
overhead. The framework is transparent, reproducible, and readily integrates
with off-the-shelf LLMs, advancing trustworthy generation in real-world
settings.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications has
driven the need for structured and reliable responses. A key challenge in
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems is ensuring that outputs align
with expected formats while minimizing hallucinations. This study examines the
role of guided decoding in RAG systems, comparing three methods, Outlines,
XGrammar, and LM Format Enforcer, across different multi-turn prompting setups
(0-turn, 1-turn, and 2-turn). By evaluating success rates, hallucination rates,
and output quality, we provide insights into their performance and
applicability. Our findings reveal how multi-turn interactions influence guided
decoding, uncovering unexpected performance variations that can inform method
selection for specific use cases. This work advances the understanding of
structured output generation in RAG systems, offering both theoretical insights
and practical guidance for LLM deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable analysis of intertextual relationships between literary texts through quantitative methods rather than traditional qualitative approaches.

Method: Perform pairwise comparisons of n-gram embeddings from two texts and average the results to calculate overall intertextuality score.

Result: Method validated on four texts with known intertextuality degrees and scaled to 267 diverse texts, demonstrating effectiveness and efficiency. Network analysis revealed centrality and community structures.

intricate links between literary texts that are created by various types of
references. This paper proposes a new quantitative model of intertextuality to
enable scalable analysis and network-based insights: perform pairwise
comparisons of the embeddings of n-grams from two texts and average their
results as the overall intertextuality. Validation on four texts with known
degrees of intertextuality, alongside a scalability test on 267 diverse texts,

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoLER is a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning with a two-stage pipeline (continual pre-training and RL) to optimize retrieval performance through balanced domain knowledge learning and query enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches in RAG systems struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhancement, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Continual pre-training using Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain knowledge with general capabilities, 2) Reinforcement learning phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation. Uses Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) for efficient training and Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF) for scalable inference.

Result: Extensive experiments show MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains through its innovative reinforcement learning approach and fusion strategies.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval
stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking
optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge
learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance.
To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that
uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a
two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of
Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language
capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for
maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage
Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL
training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage
Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER
achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline
methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and
scalable retrieval in specialized domains.

TL;DR: IntrEx dataset for analyzing engagement in educational conversations, showing fine-tuned LLMs outperform GPT-4o in predicting interestingness, with linguistic factors like concreteness and readability influencing engagement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining learner engagement in second-language educational conversations remains challenging, with limited understanding of linguistic features that drive interest in dialogues compared to educational texts.

Method: Created IntrEx dataset with sequence-level annotations from Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus, using comparison-based rating with 100+ second-language learners inspired by RLHF. Tested LLMs (7B/8B parameters) for predicting interestingness judgments.

Result: Fine-tuned LLMs outperformed larger proprietary models like GPT-4o in predicting human interestingness judgments. Linguistic factors such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and uptake significantly influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Conclusion: Specialized datasets like IntrEx enable effective modeling of engagement in educational settings, with fine-tuned smaller models outperforming larger general models, demonstrating the importance of linguistic and cognitive factors in maintaining learner interest.

Abstract: Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet
maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge.
While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting,
still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large
dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in
teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus
(TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations,
allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how
interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation
process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating
approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can
predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters)
fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like
GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model
engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and
cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and
uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.

Conclusion: ParCzech4Speech 1.0 provides a valuable resource for Czech speech technology development with multiple usage options and permissive licensing for research and applications.

Abstract: We introduce ParCzech4Speech 1.0, a processed version of the ParCzech 4.0
corpus, targeted at speech modeling tasks with the largest variant containing

by extracting more data with higher alignment reliability. The dataset is
offered in three flexible variants: (1) sentence-segmented for automatic speech
recognition and speech synthesis tasks with clean boundaries, (2) unsegmented
preserving original utterance flow across sentences, and (3) a raw-alignment
for further custom refinement for other possible tasks. All variants maintain
the original metadata and are released under a permissive CC-BY license. The

TL;DR: Direct subjectivity identification outperforms value prediction for flagging subjective arguments in human value recognition tasks, with contrastive loss reducing dependency on per-label subjectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aggregating multiple annotations into single labels hides valuable insights into annotator disagreement, especially in subjective tasks like recognizing human values in arguments.

Method: Evaluated two approaches: inferring subjectivity through value prediction vs. direct subjectivity identification. Tested combining contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss.

Result: Direct subjectivity identification significantly improves model performance for flagging subjective arguments. Contrastive loss + binary cross-entropy doesn't improve performance but reduces dependency on per-label subjectivity.

Conclusion: Proposed methods help identify arguments with differing interpretations, enabling more nuanced annotation processes for subjective tasks.

Abstract: Aggregating multiple annotations into a single ground truth label may hide
valuable insights into annotator disagreement, particularly in tasks where
subjectivity plays a crucial role. In this work, we explore methods for
identifying subjectivity in recognizing the human values that motivate
arguments. We evaluate two main approaches: inferring subjectivity through
value prediction vs. directly identifying subjectivity. Our experiments show
that direct subjectivity identification significantly improves the model
performance of flagging subjective arguments. Furthermore, combining
contrastive loss with binary cross-entropy loss does not improve performance
but reduces the dependency on per-label subjectivity. Our proposed methods can
help identify arguments that individuals may interpret differently, fostering a
more nuanced annotation process.

*Yanrui Du,Fenglei Fan,Sendong Zhao,Jiawei Cao,Qika Lin,Kai He,Ting Liu,Bing Qin,Mengling Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCon method uses projection-constrained loss to prevent refusal direction drift during instruction fine-tuning, enhancing LLM safety while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instruction fine-tuning compromises LLM safety by causing refusal direction drift, leading to reduced ability to reject malicious instructions.

Method: ProCon introduces projection-constrained loss to regularize hidden state projections onto refusal direction, with warm-up strategy and broadened data distribution for stronger constraint signals.

Result: Significantly mitigates safety risks while preserving task performance gains across various datasets, scenarios, and LLMs, outperforming strong baselines.

Conclusion: ProCon stabilizes refusal direction during training and provides interpretability-driven foundation for future LLM safety research.

Abstract: Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) has been widely adopted as an effective
post-training strategy to enhance various abilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, prior studies have shown that IFT can significantly compromise
LLMs' safety, particularly their ability to refuse malicious instructions,
raising significant concerns. Recent research into the internal mechanisms of
LLMs has identified the refusal direction (r-direction) in the hidden states,
which plays a pivotal role in governing refusal behavior. Building on this
insight, our study reveals that the r-direction tends to drift during training,
which we identify as one of the causes of the associated safety risks. To
mitigate such drift, our proposed ProCon method introduces a
projection-constrained loss term that regularizes the projection magnitude of
each training sample's hidden state onto the r-direction. Our initial analysis
shows that applying an appropriate constraint can effectively mitigate the
refusal direction drift and associated safety risks, but remains limited by
overall performance barriers. To overcome this barrier, informed by our
observation of early-stage sharp drift and a data-driven perspective, we
introduce a warm-up strategy that emphasizes early-stage strong constraints and
broaden the data distribution to strengthen constraint signals, leading to an
enhanced ProCon method. Experimental results under various datasets, scenarios,
and LLMs demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate safety risks
posed by IFT while preserving task performance gains. Even compared with strong
baselines, our method consistently delivers superior overall performance.
Crucially, our analysis indicates that ProCon can contribute to stabilizing the
r-direction during training, while such an interpretability-driven exploration
of LLMs' internal mechanisms lays a solid foundation for future safety
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MachineLearningLM is a continued-pretraining framework that enhances LLMs' in-context learning for ML tasks using synthetic data from structural causal models, achieving strong performance on tabular classification while preserving general capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle to learn from many in-context examples on standard ML tasks without gradient descent, despite having broad knowledge and reasoning abilities.

Method: Continued pretraining using millions of synthetic ML tasks from structural causal models, with random-forest teacher distillation for numerical robustness and token-efficient prompt serialization for 3-6x more examples per context.

Result: Outperforms strong LLM baselines by ~15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across multiple domains, shows many-shot scaling (accuracy improves from 8 to 1,024 shots), achieves random-forest-level accuracy, and preserves 75.4% MMLU score.

Conclusion: MachineLearningLM successfully equips general-purpose LLMs with robust in-context ML capability while maintaining their general knowledge and reasoning abilities for broader applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) possess broad world knowledge and strong
general-purpose reasoning ability, yet they struggle to learn from many
in-context examples on standard machine learning (ML) tasks, that is, to
leverage many-shot demonstrations purely via in-context learning (ICL) without
gradient descent. We introduce MachineLearningLM, a portable
continued-pretraining framework that equips a general-purpose LLM with robust
in-context ML capability while preserving its general knowledge and reasoning
for broader chat workflows.
  Our pretraining procedure synthesizes ML tasks from millions of structural
causal models (SCMs), spanning shot counts up to 1,024. We begin with a
random-forest teacher, distilling tree-based decision strategies into the LLM
to strengthen robustness in numerical modeling. All tasks are serialized with a
token-efficient prompt, enabling 3x to 6x more examples per context window and
delivering up to 50x amortized throughput via batch inference.
  Despite a modest setup (Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct with LoRA rank 8),
MachineLearningLM outperforms strong LLM baselines (e.g., GPT-5-mini) by an
average of about 15% on out-of-distribution tabular classification across
finance, physics, biology, and healthcare domains. It exhibits a striking
many-shot scaling law: accuracy increases monotonically as in-context
demonstrations grow from 8 to 1,024. Without any task-specific training, it
attains random-forest-level accuracy across hundreds of shots. General chat
capabilities, including knowledge and reasoning, are preserved: it achieves
75.4% on MMLU.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoGU_v2 framework improves LLM security without sacrificing usability through dynamic routing and bidirectional adaptation, achieving robust performance across various LLM types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current security methods for LLMs often lead to overly conservative, rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability, creating a need to advance the Pareto frontier between security and usability rather than forcing trade-offs.

Method: MoGU_v2 framework uses intra-layer routers embedded only in layers encoding highly classifiable security features, with routers dynamically allocating weights by sensing hidden states. Backbone modules are activated during router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation between routers and hidden states.

Result: MoGU_v2 exhibits strong adaptability and stable improvements across various LLM series (mainstream, on-device, and reasoning LLMs), can restore security compromised by Instruction Fine-tuning without sacrificing task performance gains through a simple data-mix strategy.

Conclusion: MoGU_v2 provides a robust and versatile solution for mitigating security risks in real-world LLM applications by effectively balancing security and usability without parameter redundancy or performance bottlenecks.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly permeate human life, their
security has emerged as a critical concern, particularly their ability to
maintain harmless responses to malicious instructions. Although extensive
methods have improved LLMs' security, they often lead to conservative,
rejection-oriented responses that compromise practical usability. This presents
a key challenge: how to advance the Pareto frontier between LLMs' usability and
security, rather than necessitate a trade-off between them. To address this, we
propose the MoGU framework, in which the intra-layer router dynamically
allocates weights by sensing hidden states, thereby balancing the contributions
of security-optimized and usability-optimized variants. Despite its initial
potential, the MoGU framework faces limitations such as parameter redundancy
and performance bottlenecks. To overcome these, we further propose an improved
MoGU_v2 framework that establishes a tighter coupling between the routers and
hidden states. In MoGU_v2, routers are embedded only in layers encoding highly
classifiable security features, and backbone modules are activated during
router optimization to enable bidirectional adaptation. MoGU_V2 exhibits strong
adaptability and stable improvements across various series of LLMs, including
mainstream LLMs serving as brains in various applications, on-device LLMs
optimized for resource-constrained scenarios, and reasoning LLMs tailored for
user interpretability. Meanwhile, even facing risks introduced by Instruction
Fine-tuning, MoGU_v2 can easily restore security without compromising the task
performance gains via a simple data-mix strategy. These comprehensive
improvements highlight MoGU_V2 as a robust and versatile solution for
mitigating security risks in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data for advancing mathematical reasoning in Large Language Models by leveraging existing automated theorem proving research.

Method: Uses E-prover's saturation capabilities on TPTP axiom library to generate valid theorems, filters for interesting results, and creates three difficulty-controlled tasks: entailment verification, premise selection, and proof reconstruction.

Result: Zero-shot experiments on frontier models show performance collapses on tasks requiring deep structural reasoning, revealing a clear weakness in current LLM capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework provides both a diagnostic tool to measure the reasoning gap in LLMs and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address mathematical reasoning deficiencies.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, logically sound data is a critical bottleneck
for advancing the mathematical reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our
work confronts this challenge by turning decades of automated theorem proving
research into a scalable data engine. Rather than relying on error-prone LLMs
or complex proof-assistant syntax like Lean and Isabelle, our framework
leverages E-prover's saturation capabilities on the vast TPTP axiom library to
derive a massive, guaranteed-valid corpus of theorems. Our pipeline is
principled and simple: saturate axioms, filter for "interesting" theorems, and
generate tasks. With no LLMs in the loop, we eliminate factual errors by
construction. This purely symbolic data is then transformed into three
difficulty-controlled challenges: entailment verification, premise selection,
and proof reconstruction. Our zero-shot experiments on frontier models reveal a
clear weakness: performance collapses on tasks requiring deep, structural
reasoning. Our framework provides both the diagnostic tool to measure this gap
and a scalable source of symbolic training data to address it. We make the code
and data publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unstructured free-text turbine maintenance logs present barriers to automated analysis, hindering effective wind power O&M and LCOE reduction.

Method: Novel reproducible framework for benchmarking diverse state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs on classifying complex industrial maintenance records.

Result: Clear performance hierarchy identified with top models showing high alignment with benchmark standards and trustworthy confidence scores. Performance depends on semantic ambiguity - better on objective component identification than interpretive maintenance actions.

Conclusion: Human-in-the-Loop systems are most effective, with LLMs acting as assistants to accelerate data labeling for human experts, enhancing O&M data quality and reliability analysis.

Abstract: Effective Operation and Maintenance (O&M) is critical to reducing the
Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) from wind power, yet the unstructured,
free-text nature of turbine maintenance logs presents a significant barrier to
automated analysis. Our paper addresses this by presenting a novel and
reproducible framework for benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on the
task of classifying these complex industrial records. To promote transparency
and encourage further research, this framework has been made publicly available
as an open-source tool. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of
state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs, providing a foundational
assessment of their trade-offs in reliability, operational efficiency, and
model calibration. Our results quantify a clear performance hierarchy,
identifying top models that exhibit high alignment with a benchmark standard
and trustworthy, well-calibrated confidence scores. We also demonstrate that
classification performance is highly dependent on the task's semantic
ambiguity, with all models showing higher consensus on objective component
identification than on interpretive maintenance actions. Given that no model
achieves perfect accuracy and that calibration varies dramatically, we conclude
that the most effective and responsible near-term application is a
Human-in-the-Loop system, where LLMs act as a powerful assistant to accelerate
and standardise data labelling for human experts, thereby enhancing O&M data
quality and downstream reliability analysis.

### [60] [COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across Channels and Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06836)
*Eugene Kwek,Wenpeng Yin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COMPACT is a pruning method that jointly prunes rare vocabulary tokens and FFN intermediate channels using token-weighted activations, maintaining standard transformer architecture while achieving state-of-the-art efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Making LLMs more efficient for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at scale by addressing limitations of prior pruning methods that break transformer layout or cause abrupt accuracy drops.

Method: Joint pruning of rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding layers and pruning FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations that align importance with post-pruning token distribution.

Result: State-of-the-art downstream task performance across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma families (0.5B-70B) at similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters, GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

Conclusion: COMPACT combines benefits of depth and width pruning while maintaining deployment-friendliness, scale-adaptivity, training-free operation, and strong memory savings with throughput gains.

Abstract: Making LLMs more efficient in memory, latency, and serving cost is crucial
for edge deployment, interactive applications, and sustainable inference at
scale. Pruning is a key technique toward this goal. However, prior pruning
methods are limited: width pruning often breaks the standard transformer layout
or requires custom inference code, while depth pruning removes entire layers
and can cause abrupt accuracy drops. In this work, we propose COMPACT, which
jointly (i) prunes rare vocabulary to shrink embedding/unembedding and (ii)
prunes FFN intermediate channels using common-token-weighted activations,
aligning importance with the post-pruning token distribution. COMPACT enjoys
merits of both depth and width pruning, such as: deployment-friendliness (keeps
a standard transformer architecture), scale-adaptivity (trade off vocab vs. FFN
pruning), training-free operation with competitive pruning time, and strong
memory savings alongside throughput gains. Experiments across Qwen, LLaMA, and
Gemma families (0.5B-70B) show state-of-the-art downstream task performance at
similar or higher pruning ratios, with substantial reductions in parameters,
GPU memory, and end-to-end latency.

*Mohammad Reza Mirbagheri,Mohammad Mahdi Mirkamali,Zahra Motoshaker Arani,Ali Javeri,Amir Mahdi Sadeghzadeh,Rasool Jalili*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Introduces EPT metric for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in Persian context across 6 dimensions, revealing significant safety deficiencies in major models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show impressive performance but lack culturally-grounded trustworthiness evaluation, especially for Persian ethical-cultural values.

Method: Created culturally informed EPT benchmark with labeled dataset, evaluated leading LLMs using both automated LLM-based and human assessments across six trustworthiness aspects.

Result: Significant deficiencies found in safety dimension across tested models (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, Qwen), highlighting critical gaps in model alignment with Persian values.

Conclusion: Urgent need for focused attention on safety aspects and culturally responsible AI development; EPT benchmark provides valuable tool for advancing trustworthy AI in Persian context.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets using advanced
deep learning architectures, have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of language tasks, becoming a cornerstone of modern AI technologies.
However, ensuring their trustworthiness remains a critical challenge, as
reliability is essential not only for accurate performance but also for
upholding ethical, cultural, and social values. Careful alignment of training
data and culturally grounded evaluation criteria are vital for developing
responsible AI systems. In this study, we introduce the EPT (Evaluation of
Persian Trustworthiness) metric, a culturally informed benchmark specifically
designed to assess the trustworthiness of LLMs across six key aspects:
truthfulness, safety, fairness, robustness, privacy, and ethical alignment. We
curated a labeled dataset and evaluated the performance of several leading
models - including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, LLaMA, Mistral, and
Qwen - using both automated LLM-based and human assessments. Our results reveal
significant deficiencies in the safety dimension, underscoring the urgent need
for focused attention on this critical aspect of model behavior. Furthermore,
our findings offer valuable insights into the alignment of these models with
Persian ethical-cultural values and highlight critical gaps and opportunities
for advancing trustworthy and culturally responsible AI. The dataset is
publicly available at: https://github.com/Rezamirbagheri110/EPT-Benchmark.

### [62] [The Majority is not always right: RL training for solution aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06870)
*Wenting Zhao,Pranjal Aggarwal,Swarnadeep Saha,Asli Celikyilmaz,Jason Weston,Ilia Kulikov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AggLM learns to aggregate multiple LLM solutions using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, outperforming majority voting and reward models while using fewer tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aggregation methods like majority voting or reward model ranking provide limited benefits for improving LLM reasoning through test-time compute scaling.

Method: Train an aggregator model using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to review, reconcile, and synthesize final answers from candidate solutions, balancing easy and hard training examples.

Result: AggLM outperforms rule-based and reward-model baselines across multiple benchmarks, generalizes to solutions from different models (including stronger ones), and requires fewer tokens than majority voting.

Conclusion: Learning aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill through reinforcement learning with careful training example balancing is an effective approach for improving LLM performance on reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions
and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for
improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While
most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to
aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this
work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a
set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile,
and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard
training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover
minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers.
Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and
reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes
effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than
contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens
than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores different prompting and in-context learning methods for extracting check-worthy claims from social media, finding that fine-tuned FLAN-T5 achieves the best METEOR score but other methods sometimes produce higher-quality claims despite lower scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify effective methods for extracting check-worthy claims from social media content, particularly through various prompting techniques and in-context learning approaches.

Method: Used few-shot prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning with different LLM families, specifically testing FLAN-T5 models among others.

Result: Fine-tuned FLAN-T5 achieved the best METEOR score, but other methods sometimes extracted higher-quality claims even with lower METEOR scores.

Conclusion: While automated metrics like METEOR are useful, they don't always capture claim quality perfectly, suggesting the need for more nuanced evaluation approaches in claim extraction tasks.

Abstract: We participate in CheckThat! Task 2 English and explore various methods of
prompting and in-context learning, including few-shot prompting and fine-tuning
with different LLM families, with the goal of extracting check-worthy claims
from social media passages. Our best METEOR score is achieved by fine-tuning a
FLAN-T5 model. However, we observe that higher-quality claims can sometimes be
extracted using other methods, even when their METEOR scores are lower.

*Marc Marone,Orion Weller,William Fleshman,Eugene Yang,Dawn Lawrie,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mmBERT is a new multilingual encoder-only language model pretrained on 3T tokens across 1800+ languages, featuring novel techniques like inverse mask ratio schedule and inverse temperature sampling that achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification and retrieval tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There has been a lack of recent research on encoder-only models, particularly multilingual ones, despite their widespread use in standard ML tasks like classification and retrieval.

Method: Pretrained on 3T multilingual tokens using novel techniques: inverse mask ratio schedule, inverse temperature sampling ratio, and adding 1700+ low-resource languages only during the decay phase to maximize performance gains.

Result: Achieves similar classification performance to OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, significantly outperforms previous generation models on both high and low-resource languages for classification and retrieval tasks.

Conclusion: mmBERT demonstrates that strategic training techniques and phased inclusion of low-resource languages can dramatically boost performance, making encoder-only models competitive with larger multimodal models on standard tasks.

Abstract: Encoder-only languages models are frequently used for a variety of standard
machine learning tasks, including classification and retrieval. However, there
has been a lack of recent research for encoder models, especially with respect
to multilingual models. We introduce mmBERT, an encoder-only language model
pretrained on 3T tokens of multilingual text in over 1800 languages. To build
mmBERT we introduce several novel elements, including an inverse mask ratio
schedule and an inverse temperature sampling ratio. We add over 1700
low-resource languages to the data mix only during the decay phase, showing
that it boosts performance dramatically and maximizes the gains from the
relatively small amount of training data. Despite only including these
low-resource languages in the short decay phase we achieve similar
classification performance to models like OpenAI's o3 and Google's Gemini 2.5
Pro. Overall, we show that mmBERT significantly outperforms the previous
generation of models on classification and retrieval tasks -- on both high and
low-resource languages.

### [65] [Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN): A Protocol for Trustworthy Numeric Answers from LLMs via Claim Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06902)
*Aivin V. Solatorio*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PCN is a verification protocol that ensures numeric fidelity in LLM outputs by requiring mechanical proof of claims before displaying numbers as verified.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safeguards like retrieval-augmented generation and citations improve transparency but cannot guarantee numeric fidelity, as LLMs may still generate fabricated or misquoted numbers.

Method: PCN emits numeric spans as claim-bound tokens tied to structured claims, with a verifier checking each token under declared policies (exact equality, rounding, tolerance, etc.). Verification occurs at the renderer level, not the model.

Result: PCN provides soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and monotonicity under policy refinement. It's lightweight, model-agnostic, and integrates seamlessly with existing applications.

Conclusion: PCN establishes a trust contract where numbers are only marked as verified with proof, while unverified numbers communicate uncertainty, preventing numeric hallucination in sensitive settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as stochastic systems may generate numbers that
deviate from available data, a failure known as \emph{numeric hallucination}.
Existing safeguards -- retrieval-augmented generation, citations, and
uncertainty estimation -- improve transparency but cannot guarantee fidelity:
fabricated or misquoted values may still be displayed as if correct. We propose
\textbf{Proof-Carrying Numbers (PCN)}, a presentation-layer protocol that
enforces numeric fidelity through mechanical verification. Under PCN, numeric
spans are emitted as \emph{claim-bound tokens} tied to structured claims, and a
verifier checks each token under a declared policy (e.g., exact equality,
rounding, aliases, or tolerance with qualifiers). Crucially, PCN places
verification in the \emph{renderer}, not the model: only claim-checked numbers
are marked as verified, and all others default to unverified. This separation
prevents spoofing and guarantees fail-closed behavior. We formalize PCN and
prove soundness, completeness under honest tokens, fail-closed behavior, and
monotonicity under policy refinement. PCN is lightweight and model-agnostic,
integrates seamlessly into existing applications, and can be extended with
cryptographic commitments. By enforcing verification as a mandatory step before
display, PCN establishes a simple contract for numerically sensitive settings:
\emph{trust is earned only by proof}, while the absence of a mark communicates
uncertainty.

### [66] [Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948)
*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Li Shen,Jing Bai,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A bilevel optimization method that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) for LLM reasoning, enabling SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL optimization for better performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current two-stage SFT-then-RL approaches limit interaction between training paradigms, constraining overall effectiveness and suffering from RL's trial-and-error inefficiency in reasoning tasks.

Method: Bilevel optimization framework where lower level performs RL updates with SFT supervision, and upper level explicitly maximizes cooperative gain (performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone).

Result: Outperforms baselines on five reasoning benchmarks, achieving better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed bilevel optimization approach enables better cooperation between SFT and RL, leading to consistently superior performance in reasoning tasks while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe
efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common
practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this
decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby
constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for
learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate
better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT
objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how
to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs
RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level
explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint
SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and
achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.

### [67] [Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning Framework for Diffusion Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06949)
*Yinjie Wang,Ling Yang,Bowen Li,Ye Tian,Ke Shen,Mengdi Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TraceRL is a trajectory-aware RL framework for diffusion language models that improves reasoning performance on math and coding tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results with smaller models compared to larger autoregressive models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance diffusion language models' reasoning capabilities by incorporating preferred inference trajectories into post-training, making them more effective for complex tasks while maintaining training stability.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based value model for stable training, applies trajectory-aware reinforcement learning across different architectures, and employs curriculum learning to create long chain-of-thought models.

Result: TraDo-4B-Instruct outperforms 7B-scale AR models on math reasoning, TraDo-8B-Instruct shows 6.1% improvement over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct. First long-CoT DLM achieves 18.1% accuracy gain on MATH500.

Conclusion: TraceRL effectively enhances diffusion language models' reasoning capabilities, demonstrating superior performance with smaller model sizes while providing a comprehensive open-source framework for practical deployment.

Abstract: We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for
diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference
trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different
architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances
training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex
math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific
models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing
TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models,
namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still
consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks.
TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first
long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1%
relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical
applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building,
training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The
framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for
both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of
various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and
general tasks. Code and Models: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/dLLM-RL

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Evaluation framework for testing LMs' pragmatic reasoning using Wavelength game, showing large LMs achieve human-like comprehension while RSA improves production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand language models' pragmatic reasoning abilities as conversational agents, since language use is shaped by communicative goals and contextual norms.

Method: Proposed evaluation framework based on Wavelength communication game, testing LMs on comprehension and production using direct prompting, Chain-of-Thought prompting, and Rational Speech Act (RSA) approach with Bayesian pragmatic reasoning.

Result: State-of-the-art LMs achieved human-like accuracy in comprehension without CoT or RSA. On production, CoT outperformed direct prompting, and RSA provided significant improvements over both approaches.

Conclusion: Study identifies LM pragmatic reasoning strengths/limitations, demonstrates RSA's potential for improvement, and opens avenues for understanding conceptual representation and social reasoning in both LMs and humans.

Abstract: Language use is shaped by pragmatics -- i.e., reasoning about communicative
goals and norms in context. As language models (LMs) are increasingly used as
conversational agents, it becomes ever more important to understand their
pragmatic reasoning abilities. We propose an evaluation framework derived from
Wavelength, a popular communication game where a speaker and a listener
communicate about a broad range of concepts in a granular manner. We study a
range of LMs on both language comprehension and language production using
direct and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, and further explore a Rational
Speech Act (RSA) approach to incorporating Bayesian pragmatic reasoning into LM
inference. We find that state-of-the-art LMs, but not smaller ones, achieve
strong performance on language comprehension, obtaining similar-to-human
accuracy and exhibiting high correlations with human judgments even without CoT
prompting or RSA. On language production, CoT can outperform direct prompting,
and using RSA provides significant improvements over both approaches. Our study
helps identify the strengths and limitations in LMs' pragmatic reasoning
abilities and demonstrates the potential for improving them with RSA, opening
up future avenues for understanding conceptual representation, language
understanding, and social reasoning in LMs and humans.

### [69] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++ improves upon standard label smoothing by preserving inter-class relationships while reducing overconfidence in neural network predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard label smoothing addresses overconfidence by adding uniform noise to one-hot labels, but it ignores important inter-class relationships by treating all non-target classes equally.

Method: Proposes Label Smoothing++ which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes while accounting for their inter-class relationships, using a fixed target label while allowing the network to learn non-target class labels.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while promoting inter-class relationships and improving generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++ provides a more effective regularization strategy that preserves class relationships while addressing the overconfidence issues of traditional one-hot labeling.

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD is a visual interactive labeling tool that combines human expertise with active learning for object detection, making the annotation process more transparent and effective through visual analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional active learning for object detection lacks transparency and limits human strategic insight, while manual annotation is time-consuming and expensive. Human-in-the-loop approaches with visual analytics can bridge this gap.

Method: Developed VILOD tool with t-SNE projections, uncertainty heatmaps, and model state views to enable interactive exploration and diverse sample selection strategies in an iterative human-AI workflow.

Result: Comparative use cases showed VILOD makes model states and dataset characteristics interpretable (RQ1) and achieves competitive object detection performance compared to automated uncertainty sampling baseline (RQ2).

Conclusion: VILOD contributes a novel tool that makes human-in-the-loop active learning workflows for object detection annotation more transparent, manageable, and potentially more effective.

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) with dynamic alpha parameter that adapts during training instead of using fixed weighting between hard and soft supervision losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD uses fixed alpha hyperparameter to balance hard-label cross-entropy and soft-label distillation loss, but static alpha is suboptimal as optimal trade-off varies during training.

Method: 1) Make alpha learnable parameter optimized during training; 2) Use formula based on student-teacher discrepancy gap to compute alpha dynamically; 3) Introduce Context-Aware Module (MLP + Attention) to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher outputs.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 teacher and ResNet-18 student show superior accuracy compared to fixed-weight KD baselines and more stable convergence.

Conclusion: Adaptive knowledge distillation with dynamic alpha parameter and context-aware reweighting outperforms traditional fixed-weight KD approaches.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates three edge-centric network measures (FRC, ORC, EBC) for pruning randomly wired neural networks in COVID-19 chest x-ray classification, finding that computationally efficient FRC achieves comparable pruning performance to more complex ORC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how different edge-centric network measures can effectively compress randomly wired neural networks while preserving performance, and to determine if computationally efficient Forman-Ricci curvature can match the pruning effectiveness of more complex measures.

Method: Used three edge-centric measures (Forman-Ricci curvature, Ollivier-Ricci curvature, edge betweenness centrality) to prune randomly wired neural networks across three network generators (ER, WS, BA models) for COVID-19 chest x-ray classification, evaluating compression ratio and theoretical speedup.

Result: FRC-based pruning effectively simplified RWNNs with significant computational advantages while maintaining performance comparable to ORC, providing initial evidence for efficient network compression.

Conclusion: Forman-Ricci curvature offers a computationally efficient alternative to Ollivier-Ricci curvature for neural network pruning, achieving comparable performance while reducing complexity, with insights into the trade-off between modular segregation and network efficiency in compressed networks.

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

*Juan Carlos Martinez-Sevilla,Francesco Foscarin,Patricia Garcia-Iasci,David Rizo,Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza,Gerhard Widmer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a novel dataset and OMR model for handwritten jazz lead sheets, addressing challenges like chord recognition and handwriting variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OMR systems cannot handle chords in handwritten jazz lead sheets, and there are quality issues with handwritten images that need specialized solutions.

Method: Created a dataset of 293 handwritten jazz lead sheets with aligned ground truth scores, generated synthetic score images, and developed a specialized OMR model with specific tokenization for jazz data using pretrained models.

Result: Produced a comprehensive dataset with 2021 staves and corresponding synthetic images, along with a functional OMR model tailored for jazz lead sheet recognition.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses OMR challenges for handwritten jazz scores by providing both a valuable dataset and a specialized model, with all resources publicly released for further research.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [75] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM framework uses synthetic data with 4 types of annotations and a two-stage self-correcting inference process to improve object recognition robustness against domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployments expose object recognition models to various domain shifts (image statistics, pose/viewpoint changes, occlusion, class confusion) that cause severe accuracy drops.

Method: Synthetic dataset generation with 4-clue annotations (bounding boxes, class names, object captions, scene captions), parameter-efficient tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct, and two-stage Re-Thinking inference with self-correction.

Result: RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong baselines across robustness benchmarks isolating individual domain shifts.

Conclusion: Integration of structured multimodal evidence with explicit self-critique loops provides a promising approach for reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A smartphone-based system using YOLOv5 and Kalman filter to measure badminton smash speed through video analysis, making performance analytics accessible to amateur players.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sports performance measurement technology is expensive and complex, creating a barrier for amateur and recreational badminton players who need accessible feedback for skill development.

Method: Uses custom-trained YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, Kalman filter for trajectory tracking, and video-based kinematic speed estimation with spatiotemporal scaling from standard smartphone recordings.

Result: Developed a cost-effective, user-friendly mobile application that automatically calculates shuttlecock velocity, providing high-level performance analytics previously unavailable to amateur players.

Conclusion: The system successfully democratizes access to professional-level badminton performance metrics, empowering players at all skill levels to analyze and improve their game using ubiquitous smartphone technology.

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Large-scale Chinese handwriting database and toolbox reveal hierarchical linguistic influences on character, radical, and stroke-level handwriting processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how linguistic components (phonological, semantic, orthographic) modulate Chinese handwriting at different levels and address the lack of comprehensive tools for capturing fine-grained handwriting data.

Method: Constructed a large-scale handwriting database with 42 Chinese speakers writing 1200 characters each, enhanced the OpenHandWrite_Toolbox for stroke-level trajectory capture and batch processing of handwriting measurements, and conducted multiple regression analyses.

Result: Orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and execution across all levels (character, radical, stroke), phonological factors influence execution at all levels, with hierarchical attenuation - strongest effects at character level, weaker at radical level, and weakest at stroke level.

Conclusion: Handwriting preparation and execution at radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic components, and the database/toolbox provide valuable resources for future psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on handwriting across languages.

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

*Younggeol Cho,Gokhan Solak,Olivia Nocentini,Marta Lorenzini,Andrea Fortuna,Arash Ajoudani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid DGNN-LSTM model for early fall prediction by decoupling motion prediction and gait classification, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fall detection systems only detect falls after they occur, leaving a gap in predicting falls before they happen and analyzing the transient state between stability and falling.

Method: Proposes a hybrid model combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) for gait classification (stable/transient/fall) and LSTM networks for motion prediction, using real-time skeletal features from video sequences.

Result: Superior performance in prediction error and recognition accuracy compared to DGNN-only models and literature benchmarks when trained on OUMVLP-Pose and URFD datasets.

Conclusion: Decoupling prediction and classification tasks improves fall anticipation performance, and the method enables monitoring of transient states to enhance assistive systems.

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Comparative analysis of K-Means (hard clustering) vs Fuzzy C-Means (soft clustering) for brain tumor segmentation from MRI, showing K-Means is faster but FCM provides better accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and disease monitoring, but challenging due to tumor heterogeneity.

Method: Used BraTS2020 dataset with Gaussian filtering and CLAHE pre-processing, compared K-Means (hard clustering) and Fuzzy C-Means (soft clustering) approaches.

Result: K-Means achieved faster processing (0.3s per image) but lower accuracy (DSC 0.43), while FCM had higher computational cost (1.3s per image) but better accuracy (DSC 0.67).

Conclusion: There's a trade-off between computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy - K-Means for speed, FCM for precision in brain tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Motivation: Current pest/disease classification methods are limited to binary classification, which is insufficient for practical agricultural applications where identifying specific disease/pest types is crucial.

Method: Enhanced a pre-trained CNN model by integrating attention-based modules and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to address class imbalance issues.

Result: Achieved 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1 score on real-world field image dataset, outperforming other approaches using the same datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed robust deep learning model successfully addresses the limitations of binary classification and provides effective multi-class classification for precision agriculture applications.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

TL;DR: DVRF is a novel inversion-free text-to-image editing framework that uses velocity field discrepancy modeling and time-dependent shifts to improve editing quality without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address over-smoothing artifacts in prior distillation sampling approaches for text-to-image editing and provide a principled framework that bridges score-based diffusion and velocity-based optimization methods.

Method: Distillation-based approach that explicitly models the discrepancy between source and target velocity fields, introduces time-dependent shift terms to push noisy latents closer to target trajectory, and works within rectified flow models.

Result: Achieves superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability compared to previous methods while requiring no architectural modifications.

Conclusion: DVRF provides an efficient and broadly applicable text-to-image editing framework that theoretically connects different optimization approaches and demonstrates practical performance improvements.

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: Integrating attention mechanisms into CNNs improves medical image analysis by enhancing feature focus and discriminative performance across multiple architectures and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CNNs often fail to capture fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate medical diagnosis, limiting their effectiveness in medical image analysis.

Method: Systematically integrated attention mechanisms (Squeeze and Excitation blocks and hybrid Convolutional Block Attention Modules) into five CNN architectures (VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB5) and evaluated on brain tumor MRI and histopathological datasets.

Result: Attention-augmented CNNs consistently outperformed baseline architectures across all metrics, with EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieving the highest overall performance and substantial gains on both datasets.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms enhance both classification accuracy and feature localization, providing a systematic framework for developing robust, interpretable deep learning systems for clinical applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel self-supervised instance segmentation framework that eliminates need for human annotations, using MultiCut algorithm, mask filtering, superpixel-guided loss, and adaptive self-training to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human annotations for instance segmentation are costly to collect, creating a need for methods that can effectively segment objects without requiring expensive labeled data.

Method: MultiCut algorithm on self-supervised features for coarse masks, mask filtering for quality control, superpixel-guided mask loss (hard + soft loss) for training, and adaptive self-training to refine predicted masks.

Result: Outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on public datasets for both instance segmentation and object detection tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully demonstrates that high-quality instance segmentation can be achieved without human annotations through effective self-supervised learning techniques.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cell biomechanics involve complex phenomena fundamental to life processes, but many interactions and collective cell decisions remain unclear despite increasing research.

Method: Combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks (for mechanical cell movements) with Artificial Neural Networks (for environmental factors from computer vision), plus a separate mitosis prediction model using neural networks.

Result: The model predicts complete cell trajectories with high accuracy in both simulated and real cell migration cases, and successfully predicts mitosis events.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach effectively integrates mechanical and environmental factors to provide accurate predictions of cell migration and division events.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EMCAD - an efficient multi-scale convolutional attention decoder for brain tumor segmentation that balances performance and computational efficiency on MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumor segmentation is computationally expensive, especially with limited resources. Current decoding mechanisms have high computational costs, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Developed EMCAD (Efficient Multi-scale Convolutional Attention Decoder) for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTS2020 dataset containing MRI scans from 369 patients.

Result: Achieved best Dice score of 0.31 with stable mean Dice score of 0.285 Â± 0.015 throughout training. Model showed consistent performance without overfitting on validation set.

Conclusion: EMCAD provides a computationally efficient solution for brain tumor segmentation with moderate performance, maintaining stable results without overfitting issues.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical pre-processing step in the medical
image analysis pipeline that involves precise delineation of tumor regions from
healthy brain tissue in medical imaging data, particularly MRI scans. An
efficient and effective decoding mechanism is crucial in brain tumor
segmentation especially in scenarios with limited computational resources.
However these decoding mechanisms usually come with high computational costs.
To address this concern EMCAD a new efficient multi-scale convolutional
attention decoder designed was utilized to optimize both performance and
computational efficiency for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTs2020 dataset

obtained by the model achieved a best Dice score of 0.31 and maintained a

TL;DR: Proposes FA-VAE, a frequency-aware VAE that addresses low-frequency bias in latent tokenizers by decoupling optimization of low/high frequencies using wavelet decomposition for better texture reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current latent tokenizers in generative models prioritize low-frequency reconstruction at the expense of high-frequency fidelity, leading to over-smoothed outputs and visual artifacts in textured regions.

Method: Wavelet-based frequency-aware variational autoencoder framework that explicitly decouples optimization of low- and high-frequency components through frequency decomposition.

Result: Improved reconstruction of fine textures while preserving global structure, bridging the fidelity gap in current latent tokenizers.

Conclusion: Frequency-aware optimization is crucial for realistic image representation, with applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

TL;DR: Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is a single-shot filter pruning method that fuses multiple importance metrics to identify unstable/redundant filters, achieving 80% FLOPs reduction while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep CNNs have computational/memory limitations for practical deployment, requiring efficient compression methods that maintain performance.

Method: Fuses gradient sensitivity, Taylor expansion, and KL divergence metrics with exponential scaling to identify structurally unstable filters in a single forward-backward pass.

Result: Achieves over 80% FLOPs reduction while retaining up to 98.23% baseline accuracy at 70% pruning rate, outperforming traditional heuristics.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient deterministic solution for scalable CNN compression, enabling deployment on edge/mobile platforms.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

### [90] [An Analysis of Layer-Freezing Strategies for Enhanced Transfer Learning in YOLO Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05490)
*Andrzej D. Dobrzycki,Ana M. Bernardos,JosÃ© R. Casar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Analysis of layer-freezing strategies for YOLOv8/v10 in UAV applications shows no universal optimal approach - effectiveness depends on data properties, with up to 28% GPU memory savings and sometimes better performance than full fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying YOLO architectures in resource-constrained UAV environments requires efficient transfer learning, but the impact of different freezing configurations on modern YOLO variants remains unexplored.

Method: Systematic investigation of multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 variants using four infrastructure monitoring datasets, with gradient behavior analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM).

Result: No universal optimal freezing strategy - effectiveness depends on data properties. Freezing backbone preserves general features, shallower freeze handles class imbalance better. Up to 28% GPU memory reduction, some cases achieve higher mAP@50 than full fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Provides empirical findings and practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies, offering evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QUAN is a quaternion-based deep learning framework that approximates quaternion convolution using real-valued operations for efficient rotation-equivariant image classification and object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop an efficient rotation-equivariant framework that preserves geometric properties while enabling practical implementation, addressing limitations of conventional quaternion neural networks that operate entirely in the quaternion domain.

Method: Uses Hamilton product decomposition with real-valued operations to approximate quaternion convolution, implements custom CUDA kernels for efficiency, introduces Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for stability, and extends quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence in image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling in object detection (COCO, DOTA), and establishes SOTA for quaternion CNNs in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: QUAN shows strong potential for deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware perception and has applications in other domains due to its efficiency and geometric preservation capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALA introduces visibility-aware language aggregation and streaming weighted geometric median to address background noise and multi-view inconsistencies in distilling 2D language features into 3D Gaussians.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods suffer from two issues: background Gaussians getting the same features as foreground ones despite minimal contribution to rendering, and multi-view inconsistencies caused by view-specific noise in language embeddings.

Method: Proposes Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA) with marginal contribution computation and visibility-aware gating to retain only visible Gaussians. Also introduces streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view features.

Result: Achieves robust, view-consistent language feature embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. Improves open-vocabulary localization and segmentation performance across reference datasets.

Conclusion: VALA consistently surpasses existing works by effectively addressing background noise and multi-view inconsistency problems in language feature distillation for 3D Gaussians.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

*Haitao Tian,Pierre Payeur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DuoCLR framework using contrastive learning with novel 'Shuffle and Warp' augmentation and two surrogate tasks (CPC and ROR) for improved human action segmentation from skeleton data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing representation learning methods focus on action recognition with isolated sequence-wise representations, but action segmentation requires multi-scale representations that capture cross-sequence variations and temporal dependencies.

Method: Uses contrastive learning with 'Shuffle and Warp' data augmentation to create diverse multi-action permutations. Introduces two surrogate tasks: Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC) for intra-class similarity learning, and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR) for inter-class context reasoning.

Result: DuoCLR demonstrates significant performance boost over state-of-the-art methods in both multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks when pre-trained on trimmed skeleton data and evaluated on untrimmed data.

Conclusion: The proposed contrastive learning framework with dual surrogate tasks effectively learns multi-scale feature representations optimized for action segmentation, showing strong empirical results and component effectiveness through ablation studies.

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

*Yihong Leng,Siming Zheng,Jinwei Chen,Bo Li,Jiaojiao Li,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RED network uses robust event-guided deblurring with modality-specific disentangled representation to handle incomplete event streams and improve motion deblurring performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods overlook the inherent incompleteness of event streams caused by DVS thresholding mechanisms, which compromises motion priors and limits event-guided deblurring effectiveness.

Method: Proposes Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with: 1) Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) using random masking, 2) disentangled OmniAttention modeling intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality correlations, 3) two interactive modules to enhance motion-sensitive areas and inject semantic context.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show RED consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: The proposed RED network effectively addresses event stream incompleteness and demonstrates superior deblurring performance through robust representation learning and cross-modal interaction.

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient PTQ method using parameter sensitivity analysis to prioritize quantization of high-sensitivity parameters, achieving 20-200x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PTQ methods have high computational complexity that limits their use in resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios.

Method: Parameter sensitivity analysis guides quantization priority, with unquantized low-sensitivity parameters compensating errors. Row-parallel quantization framework with shared inverse Hessian matrix reduces complexity.

Result: 20-200x quantization speedup over Optimal Brain Quantization baseline with mean accuracy loss below 0.3% on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s.

Conclusion: The method effectively balances efficiency and accuracy for model quantization in edge computing applications.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: To create controllable 3D avatars from single portrait images with high efficiency and quality, addressing the need for real-time rendering and accurate reconstruction.

Method: Developed a large-scale one-shot Gaussian head generator using WebSSL with two-stage training for enhanced generalization and texture reconstruction. Uses ultra-lightweight Gaussian avatar driven by control signals.

Result: Achieves 90 FPS rendering at 512x512 resolution, follows scaling law for improved performance with larger reconstruction modules, and maintains driving efficiency through separation design.

Conclusion: The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating effective single-image 3D avatar generation with real-time performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Deepfake detection methods are limited by dataset constraints - lack of diversity in forgery techniques, facial scenes, real data, and real-world degradation effects.

Method: Proposed Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image (MFFI) dataset with 4 strategic dimensions: wider forgery methods, varied facial scenes, diversified authentic data, and multi-level degradation operations.

Result: MFFI contains 1024K image samples with 50 different forgery methods, outperforms existing datasets in scene complexity, cross-domain generalization, and detection difficulty gradients.

Conclusion: MFFI provides technical advancement and practical utility for simulating real-world Deepfake detection scenarios, with publicly available dataset.

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical

TL;DR: VideoGraph introduces a language-guided spatiotemporal graph network for video summarization, modeling objects and frames as graph nodes with semantic relationships, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous video summarization approaches focused on temporal modeling but overlooked fine-grained visual entities like objects. Language-guided summarization requires better semantic understanding of complex videos and how objects relate to each other.

Method: Proposes recursive spatiotemporal graph networks that formulate objects and frames as nodes in spatial and temporal graphs. Uses language queries to incorporate semantic knowledge into node representations and prevent visual similarity-based edges. Employs recursive strategy to refine graphs and classify keyframes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks for both generic and query-focused video summarization in supervised and unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: VideoGraph effectively addresses video summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem, demonstrating superior performance by leveraging semantic relationships between objects and frames through graph networks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most self-supervised representation learning methods focus on global image representations but fail to capture localized semantics needed for dense prediction tasks requiring spatial precision and fine-grained detail.

Method: Proposes Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA) that aligns dense feature distributions between teacher and student models by capturing statistical dependencies and matching structural relationships of dense patches. Also investigates specialized augmentation strategies for dense representation learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results across various dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully transfers existing semantic knowledge into dense feature space through self-supervised learning, enabling better performance on tasks requiring spatial precision and fine-grained detail.

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA is a training-free pruning method for Vision-Language-Action models that uses both local and global context information to prune tokens, achieving significant speedup with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pruning methods for VLA models only use local information from current actions, ignoring global context from prior actions, which causes significant performance drops (>20% success rate) and limited speedup.

Method: Two-level pruning with heuristic control: (1) Static pruning at action level using global history and local context, (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level based on layer-specific importance, (3) Lightweight action-aware controller that classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained and adjusts pruning aggressiveness accordingly.

Result: Achieves 1.46x speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57x speedup on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 compared to OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss on LIBERO benchmark.

Conclusion: Leveraging both local and global context information enables effective pruning of VLA models with substantial speed improvements while maintaining performance, addressing the limitations of previous methods that ignored global context.

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuMa is a novel concept erasure method that uses subspace mapping to robustly remove narrow concepts like copyrighted characters while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods fail to handle narrow concepts (copyrighted characters, celebrities) due to their proximity to non-target concepts, requiring finer-grained manipulation to address copyright and legal concerns.

Method: Subspace Mapping (SuMa) derives a target subspace representing the concept to be erased and neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference subspace that minimizes distance between them, ensuring robust erasure while preserving quality.

Result: SuMa achieves image quality comparable to effectiveness-focused approaches while matching the completeness of robustness-focused methods across subclass erasure, celebrity erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure tasks.

Conclusion: SuMa successfully addresses the challenge of erasing narrow concepts by providing both robustness and effectiveness, making it suitable for handling copyright and legal concerns in text-to-image diffusion models.

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aerial hyperspectral imaging in precision agriculture faces challenges with limited or no labels, requiring effective methods to analyze vegetation properties of trees.

Method: Uses self-supervised learning to create neural network embeddings that reflect vegetation properties from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields.

Result: The constructed tree representation using vegetation property-related embedding space outperforms direct use of hyperspectral vegetation properties in downstream machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning provides superior tree representations for agricultural analysis compared to raw hyperspectral data, enabling better performance in machine learning applications.

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

*Ha Meem Hossain,Pritam Nath,Mahitun Nesa Mahi,Imtiaz Uddin,Ishrat Jahan Eiste,Syed Nasibur Rahman Ratul,Md Naim Uddin Mozumdar,Asif Mohammed Saad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOLOv11x performs best (63.7% mAP@0.5) on Bangladesh-specific vehicle detection but is slow; medium variants offer best speed-accuracy balance; rare vehicle classes suffer from dataset imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vehicle detection systems trained on non-Bangladeshi datasets fail to accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road environments, creating gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions.

Method: Evaluated six YOLO model variants on custom dataset with 29 distinct Bangladeshi vehicle classes using high-resolution images captured with mobile phones and manually annotated with LabelImg in YOLO format.

Result: YOLOv11x achieved best performance (63.7% mAP@0.5, 43.8% mAP@0.5:0.95) but slow (45.8ms/image). Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) offered optimal balance with 62.5% and 61.8% mAP@0.5 at 14-15ms. Rare vehicles showed near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalance.

Conclusion: This research provides foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs for autonomous vehicle technology in developing regions where generic models fail.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

*Guandong Li,Zhaobin Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditIDv2 is a tuning-free solution for high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs that maintains identity consistency while enabling deep semantic editing with minimal data requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing character editing methods struggle with degraded capabilities, semantic biases, and identity breakdowns when handling long text narratives with multiple semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships.

Method: Decomposes PerceiverAttention, introduces ID loss and joint dynamic training with diffusion model, and employs offline fusion strategy for integration module to achieve multi-level semantic editing with minimal data lubrication.

Result: Achieves deep semantic editing while maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments, meets demands of long prompts and high-quality image generation, and shows excellent performance in IBench evaluation.

Conclusion: EditIDv2 successfully addresses the challenges of complex narrative editing by enabling sophisticated semantic understanding and identity preservation with minimal data requirements, outperforming existing methods in handling long text inputs.

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

### [106] [OOTSM: A Decoupled Linguistic Framework for Effective Scene Graph Anticipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05661)
*Xiaomeng Zhu,Changwei Wang,Haozhe Wang,Xinyu Liu,Fangzhen Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation (LSGA) using LLMs to predict future scene graphs from text descriptions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant long-term prediction improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Scene Graph Anticipation methods rely mainly on visual cues and struggle to incorporate commonsense knowledge, limiting long-term prediction robustness.

Method: Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method (OOTSM) where LLMs first forecast object appearances/disappearances, then generate detailed human-object relations from text-based scene graph sequences.

Result: Short-term mean-Recall (@10) increased by 3.4% and long-term mean-Recall (@50) improved dramatically by 21.9% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Linguistic approach to scene graph anticipation effectively leverages commonsense knowledge through LLMs, enabling more robust long-term predictions and demonstrating the value of text-based reasoning for scene understanding.

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

*Wasikul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Physics-inspired denoising approach using pileup-mitigation principles from particle physics improves robustness against strong noise corruption in images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage physical priors from particle physics (conservation, locality, isolation) to create more robust image denoising models that perform better under severe noise conditions.

Method: Developed hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: conservation-constrained CNN, Gaussian-noise variants, and WIPUNet (Weighted Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network) that integrates physics principles into UNet architecture.

Result: PU-inspired CNNs competitive with standard baselines; WIPUNet shows widening performance margin at higher noise levels (Ï=15-100) on CIFAR-10 and same trend on BSD500, demonstrating improved stability where data-driven models degrade.

Conclusion: Physics-inspired priors from particle physics provide valuable inductive biases for robust denoising, offering stability advantages in high-noise scenarios without requiring complex state-of-the-art architectures.

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

TL;DR: CAMVR framework enhances multi-turn visual reasoning in LVLMs with dynamic memory and adaptive attention mechanisms to prevent context loss and hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs and LVLMs struggle with multi-turn interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual reasoning, leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and hallucinations.

Method: Proposes CAMVR framework with Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) for storing visual-textual context and Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) for dynamic attention adjustment, plus multi-level reasoning integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDial, adapted A-OKVQA, and novel MTIF dataset show CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CAMVR effectively addresses multi-turn visual reasoning challenges by maintaining contextual coherence and improving visual attention in LVLMs.

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: MeshMetrics is a mesh-based framework that provides more precise computation of distance-based segmentation metrics than conventional grid-based approaches, addressing implementation pitfalls that cause significant discrepancies in existing tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The reproducibility crisis in image segmentation research is partly due to unreliable metric implementations, where distance-based metrics show substantial discrepancies (e.g., >100mm for Hausdorff distance) between common open-source tools.

Method: Developed a mesh-based framework called MeshMetrics that computes distance-based metrics more precisely than grid-based approaches, reducing discretization artifacts like distance quantization.

Result: Theoretical analysis and empirical validation show MeshMetrics achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools and is substantially less affected by discretization artifacts.

Conclusion: MeshMetrics provides a more reliable implementation of distance-based segmentation metrics and is released as an open-source Python package to improve reproducibility in segmentation research.

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR is a novel framework that uses pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models for video action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks while improving interpretability through natural language explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional human action recognition methods struggle with deep semantic understanding, complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinctions in diverse video data. The paper aims to leverage the capabilities of large language models to overcome these limitations.

Method: The framework features a Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module that transforms raw video sequences into discrete semantic action tokens, creating an "action narrative" comprehensible to LVLMs. These tokens are processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B) combined with natural language instructions for action classification and semantic reasoning.

Result: LVLM-VAR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging benchmarks: 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed LVLM-VAR framework successfully applies pre-trained vision-language models to video action recognition, achieving both superior accuracy and enhanced interpretability through natural language explanations, representing a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

TL;DR: JRN-Geo network integrates RGB and normal images for cross-view UAV geo-localization, using dual-branch feature extraction with fusion modules and 3D geographic augmentation to handle viewpoint variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely mainly on RGB semantic features and neglect spatial structural information, which is crucial for handling drastic viewpoint differences in cross-view geo-localization.

Method: Proposes JRN-Geo network with dual-branch feature extraction (RGB + normal images), Difference-Aware Fusion Module, Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation, and 3D geographic augmentation for viewpoint-invariant feature learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets, demonstrating robustness against complex viewpoint variations.

Conclusion: Incorporating geometric structural information from normal images alongside RGB data significantly improves cross-view geo-localization performance by capturing better viewpoint-invariant features.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance temporal stability and coherence in multi-modal sensor fusion (radar, sonar to LiDAR translation) for improved robustness and performance in downstream SLAM applications.

Method: Three main contributions: temporal embedding similarity for latent alignment, motion-aligned transformation loss for displacement matching, and windowed temporal fusion with specialized modules. Updated architecture for better spatial structure preservation.

Result: Improved temporal and spatial coherence, lower absolute trajectory error, better occupancy map accuracy in Cartographer-based SLAM. New metrics (FVMD-based and correlation-peak distance) show practical temporal quality improvements.

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while significantly enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance for SLAM applications.

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve highly accurate and robust state estimation by fusing data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR, and inertial sensors, addressing challenges in multi-camera integration and triangulation inconsistencies.

Method: Introduces a panoramic visual feature model that unifies multi-camera observations into a single representation, with extrinsic compensation method to address frame misalignment, integrated into a tightly coupled factor graph-based system.

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show enhanced quality and consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and robustness compared to existing systems.

Conclusion: The panoramic visual feature model with extrinsic compensation effectively improves multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry performance, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness in state estimation.

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel distance-adaptive super-resolution framework that addresses spatially-varying degradation in real-world imaging systems through a theoretically-grounded variational approach with depth-conditional neural architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional super-resolution assumes spatially-invariant degradation, but real-world imaging exhibits complex distance-dependent effects like atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field variations, and perspective distortions that require spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies.

Method: Variational framework treating super-resolution as spatially-varying inverse problem with pseudodifferential operators. Neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow through cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels and learned distance-adaptive regularization terms. Spectral constraints from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth violations.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM at 2Ã and 4Ã scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by 0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively across five benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: First theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework that significantly improves performance on depth-variant scenarios while maintaining competitive results on traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first

demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while

TL;DR: A new multi-modal dataset called InterAct is introduced for capturing realistic two-person interactions, along with a diffusion-based method to generate interactive body motions and facial expressions from speech inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works either focus on single persons or limited conversational gestures between two people, often assuming static body positions. This paper aims to capture dynamic, objective-driven interactions between two people that span longer durations and larger spaces.

Method: The authors captured a new dataset (InterAct) with 241 motion sequences of two-person interactions, including audio, body motions, and facial expressions. They propose a diffusion-based method with hierarchical body motion regression and a novel fine-tuning mechanism for improved lip accuracy.

Result: The InterAct dataset contains diverse and complex individual motions and long-term interaction patterns not seen before. The proposed method effectively estimates interactive face expressions and body motions from speech inputs.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive dataset and effective method for modeling realistic two-person interactions, enabling further research in capturing dynamic, semantically consistent human interactions.

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made

### [117] [Unleashing Hierarchical Reasoning: An LLM-Driven Framework for Training-Free Referring Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05751)
*Bingrui Zhao,Lin Yuanbo Wu,Xiangtian Fan,Deyin Liu,Lu Zhang,Ruyi He,Jialie Shen,Ximing Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARSE-VOS is a training-free framework using LLMs for referring video object segmentation, achieving SOTA results through hierarchical text parsing and spatio-temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RVOS methods struggle with aligning static text to dynamic visual content, especially with complex descriptions and objects having similar appearances but inconsistent motion/poses.

Method: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine approach: 1) Parse language query into structured commands, 2) Generate candidate trajectories via spatio-temporal grounding, 3) Two-stage reasoning (motion reasoning then pose verification) to select correct target.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS benchmarks.

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS demonstrates that training-free LLM-powered hierarchical reasoning effectively addresses complex RVOS challenges with compositional descriptions and dynamic visual content.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

*Zijian Chen,Wenjie Hua,Jinhao Li,Lirong Deng,Fan Du,Tingzhu Chen,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PictOBI-20k dataset for evaluating large multimodal models on visual decipherment of oracle bone characters, showing LMMs have preliminary skills but rely too much on language priors rather than visual information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oracle bone characters are the oldest Chinese writing but current decipherment methods are limited by archaeological constraints. Large multimodal models offer potential for visual decipherment but need proper evaluation.

Method: Created PictOBI-20k dataset with 20k OBC and real object images forming 15k+ multi-choice questions. Conducted subjective annotations to compare human-LMM visual reasoning consistency.

Result: General LMMs show preliminary visual decipherment skills but don't effectively use visual information - mostly limited by language priors rather than visual analysis.

Conclusion: The dataset facilitates evaluation and optimization of visual attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs, helping improve their visual reasoning capabilities for ancient character decipherment.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available

*Jonathan Aellen,Florian Burkhardt,Thomas Vetter,Marcel LÃ¼thi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient pose alignment method for point distribution models in medical imaging to improve partial shape reconstruction accuracy by adjusting existing models to target poses without original training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose misalignment between training data and target shapes causes biased reconstructions, especially for small shape parts, which is a commonly overlooked but crucial factor in medical imaging.

Method: An efficient preprocessing method that adjusts existing linear models to specific target poses, preserving computational efficiency while handling translations exactly and providing good approximations for small rotations.

Result: Significantly improves reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance compared to misaligned models, enabling plug-and-play adaptation of existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: The proposed pose alignment method is widely applicable and crucial for accurate partial shape reconstruction in medical imaging, as it addresses a fundamental but often overlooked issue in statistical shape modeling.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

*Jongyoun Noh,Junghyup Lee,Hyekang Park,Bumsub Ham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage 3D detection framework that improves PointPillars by introducing 3DPillars CNN architecture and sparse scene context features, achieving better performance while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PointPillars is fast but underperforms state-of-the-art methods due to limitations in preserving 3D structures and inability to effectively use two-stage detection pipelines with 3D object proposals.

Method: Introduces 3DPillars CNN that extracts 3D voxel-based features from pseudo images using 2D convolutions via separable voxel feature module, and an RoI head with sparse scene context feature module for multi-scale feature aggregation.

Result: Experimental results on KITTI and Waymo Open datasets show the approach achieves good compromise between speed and accuracy, narrowing performance gaps with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully overcomes PointPillars' limitations, enabling effective two-stage 3D detection while retaining efficiency, making it a practical solution for 3D object detection.

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

*In-Jae Lee,Sihwan Hwang,Youngseok Kim,Wonjune Kim,Sanmin Kim,Dongsuk Kum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAB is a novel camera-radar fusion model that uses backward projection with radar to reduce depth ambiguity in 3D object detection and segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous camera-radar fusion methods have limitations - forward projection struggles with sparse BEV features, while backward projection suffers from depth ambiguity leading to false positives. The complementary nature of camera (dense but unreliable depth) and radar (sparse but precise depth) needs better integration.

Method: Uses backward projection that aggregates perspective view image features into BEV queries. Combines dense depth distribution from images with precise radar occupancy information to improve depth distinction. Introduces spatial cross-attention with radar context features for better 3D scene understanding.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among backward projection-based camera-radar fusion methods on nuScenes dataset: 62.4% NDS and 54.0% mAP in 3D object detection.

Conclusion: The proposed CRAB model effectively addresses depth ambiguity in backward projection by leveraging radar's precise depth information, demonstrating superior performance in camera-radar fusion for 3D perception tasks.

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

TL;DR: Two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection in medical device manufacturing, addressing small imbalanced datasets and regulatory requirements. One uses structural similarity scoring for real-time inspection, the other uses Mahalanobis distance for supervisory monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing is challenging due to small imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and stringent regulatory requirements that demand reliable anomaly detection.

Method: Proposes two attention-guided autoencoder architectures: 1) Structural similarity-based anomaly score (4-MS-SSIM) for lightweight real-time detection, 2) Feature-distance approach using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features for distribution shift sensitivity.

Result: First method achieved ACC 0.903 (unsupervised) and 0.931 (supervised) with only 10% defective samples. Second method achieved ACC 0.722 with supervised thresholding. Both surpassed re-implemented baselines.

Conclusion: The complementary methods provide reliable inline inspection and scalable post-production surveillance, offering a practical pathway for deploying deep anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments while meeting EU AI Act requirements.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems

### [123] [A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809)
*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM extends Segment Anything Model to generate multiple plausible segmentations using latent variables, addressing annotation uncertainty in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard segmentation models like SAM are deterministic and fail to capture ambiguity in real-world tasks, particularly problematic in medical imaging where multiple expert annotations may vary.

Method: Incorporates latent variable space with variational training, adding prior and posterior networks to SAM framework to modulate prompt embeddings and enable diverse segmentation sampling.

Result: Outperforms existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics using LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset, producing outputs that align with expert disagreement.

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM successfully models segmentation uncertainty, providing diverse and plausible masks that reflect human annotation variability in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dust storms pose health hazards and reduce visibility, requiring rapid detection from satellite imagery to provide timely warnings and monitoring.

Method: 3D convolutional network that learns patterns across all 36 MODIS bands plus split thermal bands, with simple normalization and local filling for missing data handling. Improved version increases training speed 21x.

Result: Achieved approximately 0.92 accuracy with mean squared error of 0.014 on 17 independent MODIS scenes. Strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along edges.

Conclusion: Joint band-and-space learning enables timely global dust alerts; wider input windows or attention-based models could further improve edge detection.

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Motivation: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures is vital for cardiovascular disease research, but development is constrained by scarce annotated histopathological data.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation models (U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet) on limited cardiovascular histology data with Bayesian hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Model performance is highly sensitive to data splits, with minor performance differences driven more by statistical noise than true algorithmic superiority.

Conclusion: Standard benchmarking practices are limited in low-data clinical settings, and performance rankings may not reflect meaningful clinical utility.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology

with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful

TL;DR: BTCChat is a new multimodal large language model that improves bi-temporal satellite image analysis with better change understanding through specialized change extraction and prompt augmentation modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for bi-temporal satellite image analysis inadequately model temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes, limiting their effectiveness in change understanding applications like urban monitoring and disaster assessment.

Method: Proposed BTCChat with Change Extraction module to capture temporal features and spatial semantic changes, plus Prompt Augmentation mechanism to enhance attention to spatial details by incorporating contextual clues.

Result: BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on change captioning and visual question answering tasks, demonstrating superior bi-temporal change understanding capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed BTCChat framework effectively addresses limitations of previous methods by better modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes in bi-temporal satellite imagery analysis.

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Motivation: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, but existing methods fail in complex environments due to reliance on single data types. Early risk assessment is crucial for prevention.

Method: Proposes ViSK-GAT framework combining Residual Block with Lightweight Transformer Block. Includes Fine-Grained Attention Module for inter-modal feature refinement and Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module for cross-modal alignment. Uses custom multimodal dataset with 8 risk categories based on Rapid Entire Body Assessment system.

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT advances AI implementation for musculoskeletal risk classification, enabling impactful early interventions in sports through effective multimodal analysis.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CLIP-based semantic image compression that preserves semantic information instead of pixel reconstruction, achieving 2-3*10^-3 bpp (5% of traditional methods) with zero-shot robustness across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emerging applications prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and require robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks, calling for advanced semantic compression paradigms.

Method: Uses contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model to compress CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks, rather than compressing images for reconstruction.

Result: Achieves average bit rate of approximately 2-3*10^-3 bits per pixel (less than 5% of mainstream compression methods), maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, and exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CLIP-based semantic compression method provides highly efficient compression with superior semantic preservation and cross-task robustness, significantly outperforming traditional reconstruction-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

TL;DR: AttriPrompt is a novel framework that enhances CLIP's text representations by leveraging visual encoder features to create dynamic, content-aware prompts and achieves fine-grained alignment through dual-stream contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep text prompting approaches suffer from over-reliance on contrastive learning that neglects fine-grained feature optimization and use static prompts that prevent content-aware adaptation across different input categories.

Method: Proposes AttriPrompt with Attribute Retrieval module that clusters visual features from each layer to retrieve semantically similar prompts from a pool, concatenates them to text encoder inputs, uses Dual-stream Contrastive Learning for fine-grained alignment, and implements Self-Regularization to prevent overfitting.

Result: Extensive experiments across three benchmarks show AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37% improvement in base-to-novel setting and demonstrating strong cross-domain knowledge transfer capabilities.

Conclusion: The framework positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation by effectively addressing limitations of current deep prompting approaches through dynamic, content-aware prompt generation and fine-grained feature optimization.

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDE-based sampling in Flow Matching introduces noise artifacts that harm reward learning and image quality in RL applications.

Method: Draws inspiration from DDIM to reformulate sampling process with Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS) that eliminates excess stochasticity.

Result: CPS removes noise artifacts, enables more accurate reward modeling, and leads to faster, more stable convergence for RL optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

Conclusion: The proposed CPS method effectively addresses noise issues in SDE-based sampling, improving RL performance for Flow Matching models.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

### [131] [Dual Interaction Network with Cross-Image Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05953)
*Jeonghyun Noh,Wangsu Jeon,Jinsun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) with cross-attention to effectively combine original and enhanced medical images for better segmentation, plus multi-scale boundary loss for improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation is hindered by noise, blurriness, and low contrast. Existing enhancement techniques may alter crucial diagnostic information, and conventional fusion methods fail to fully leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing enhancement side effects.

Method: Dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) using bidirectional cross-attention to capture mutual complementary information between original and enhanced images, refined via global spatial attention. Also introduces multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction.

Result: Experimental results on ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrate superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed DIFM effectively exploits complementary information from original and enhanced medical images, and the multi-scale boundary loss improves segmentation accuracy at object boundaries, leading to better medical image segmentation performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a

TL;DR: Neural network-based bloom lighting methods (NBL and FastNBL) achieve 12-28% faster performance than traditional techniques while maintaining high-quality bloom effects in real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional bloom lighting techniques rely on multiple blur operations and texture sampling with conditional branching, which consume significant computational resources and are bottlenecks for real-time rendering performance.

Method: Proposed two neural network-based methods: Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL) that generate brightness masks from 3D scene views using neural networks instead of traditional blur and sampling operations.

Result: Both methods outperformed state-of-the-art bloom implementations - FastNBL was 28% faster and NBL was 12% faster, while maintaining high-quality bloom effects across various 3D scenes.

Conclusion: Neural network approaches can achieve realistic bloom lighting faster than traditional methods, saving computational resources and enabling better real-time rendering performance for immersive high-FPS environments.

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning method for medical 3D imaging that uses three interpretable sub-tasks to capture spatial semantics while maintaining performance comparable to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised methods in medical visualization lack interpretability for 3D spatial learning and often fall short in medical interpretability, despite being influenced by 2D visual domain designs.

Method: Proposes three interpretable sub-tasks designed with observable principles to capture spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging, incorporating multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to maintain training stability.

Result: Experimental results show the approach delivers performance on par with current methodologies while providing intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning process.

Conclusion: The method successfully addresses interpretability issues in medical 3D self-supervised learning while maintaining competitive performance through spatially-focused, observable sub-tasks.

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniStyle2 reframes style transfer as a data problem using destylization to create DST-100K dataset, then trains a simple FLUX-based model that outperforms state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the fundamental challenge of lacking ground-truth data in artistic style transfer by creating authentic supervision signals through destylization.

Method: Develops DST (text-guided destylization model) and DST-Filter (multi-stage evaluation with Chain-of-Thought reasoning) to build DST-100K dataset, then trains a feed-forward model based on FLUX.1-dev.

Result: OmniStyle2 consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks despite its simplicity.

Conclusion: Scalable data generation via destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm that overcomes the ground-truth data limitation in artistic style transfer.

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

*Nam Duong Tran,Nam Nguyen Phuong,Hieu H. Pham,Phi Le Nguyen,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConstStyle proposes a novel domain generalization approach that maps all samples to a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge domain gaps, achieving significant performance improvements especially with limited training domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks suffer performance drops when test data distribution differs from training data. Existing DG methods struggle with limited training domains or large gaps between seen and unseen domains.

Method: Leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features. Maps all training samples onto this unified domain optimized for seen domains, and similarly projects unseen domain samples during testing to align both training and testing data.

Result: Extensive experiments show ConstStyle consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. With limited seen domains, it boosts accuracy up to 19.82% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: ConstStyle effectively reduces the impact of domain shifts by aligning training and testing data within a unified domain, demonstrating strong performance even with large domain gaps or few seen domains.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

TL;DR: STRIDE diffusion model for sparse-view CT reconstruction with joint training, temporal reweighting guidance, distribution correction, and dual-network architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of sparse-view CT reconstruction where limited projection views lead to incomplete data and artifacts, requiring advanced generative models to complete missing information while preserving structural details.

Method: Proposes STRIDE diffusion model with: 1) joint training guided by sparse conditional probabilities, 2) temporally varying sparse condition reweighting guidance, 3) linear regression for distribution shift correction, and 4) dual-network parallel architecture for multi-frequency optimization.

Result: Achieves best improvement of 2.58 dB in PSNR, 2.37% increase in SSIM, and 0.236 reduction in MSE compared to baseline methods. Excellent generalization and robustness in structural consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Conclusion: STRIDE effectively addresses sparse-view CT reconstruction challenges through innovative diffusion model design, demonstrating superior performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative image quality across public and real datasets.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A decoupled strategy that injects precomputed segmentation priors into feature space to improve monocular 3D object detection, particularly for small objects like pedestrians and cyclists, without expanding the model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection is challenging due to lack of depth cues in single 2D images. Existing methods rely solely on RGB features, but additional segmentation information could improve detection without requiring more sensors or training data.

Method: Inject precomputed segmentation information priors directly into the feature space to guide detection, without expanding the detection model or jointly learning the priors. Focus on evaluating impact of segmentation information on existing pipelines.

Result: Outperformed equivalent RGB-only architecture on KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, particularly for small objects (pedestrians and cyclists).

Conclusion: Understanding input data through segmentation priors can balance the need for additional sensors or training data, demonstrating that additional segmentation information significantly improves monocular 3D object detection performance.

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow for monocular 6-DoF spacecraft pose estimation, outperforming single-image baselines and showing good generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most existing spacecraft pose estimation approaches rely on single static images and fail to exploit valuable temporal information inherent to space operations, limiting their performance.

Method: Adapts a human pose estimation framework to spacecraft domain, combining Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder features with motion cues from pre-trained optical flow model to localize 2D keypoints, then uses Perspective-n-Point solver for 6-DoF pose recovery.

Result: Improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint localization and 6-DoF pose estimation on SPADES-RGB dataset, with promising generalization capabilities on SPARK-2024 real and synthetic data.

Conclusion: Integrating temporal motion information through optical flow and motion-aware heatmaps significantly enhances spacecraft pose estimation performance and generalization across different data distributions.

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLV users face challenges with VQA systems due to blurry photos, poorly framed images, and difficulty articulating specific questions, leading to ambiguous visual questions with multiple valid answers that conventional single-answer VQA systems cannot handle.

Method: Proposes diverse candidate answers using LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer, and applies chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether answers refer to same or different regions.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark and proves more robust to ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings for BLV users.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for VQA systems that adapt to real human uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users, with code made publicly available to foster further research and accessibility applications.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly

TL;DR: Proposed UAV-specific datasets and cross-attention fusion module to address domain gap in open-vocabulary object detection for UAV imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OVD datasets are ground-level natural images, creating significant performance drop when applied to UAV imagery due to domain gap.

Method: Developed UAV-Label engine to create UAVDE-2M (2M+ instances, 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k (15k+ images) datasets. Proposed Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE) module integrated into YOLO-World-v2 architecture.

Result: Extensive experiments on VisDrone and SIMD datasets verified effectiveness for UAV-based imagery and remote sensing applications.

Conclusion: The proposed datasets and CAGE module successfully address the domain gap issue in open-vocabulary object detection for UAV imagery, improving performance on aerial and remote sensing data.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel fine-grained dynamic perception framework for facial micro-expression recognition that uses frame ranking to capture dynamic information and includes a dynamic image construction module to address data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Facial micro-expression recognition is challenging due to the transient, subtle nature of micro-expressions. Existing methods either rely on hand-crafted features requiring key frames or deep networks that suffer from small-scale, low-diversity training data.

Method: Proposes a fine-grained dynamic perception framework that ranks frame-level features chronologically to encode dynamic information. Uses a local-global feature-aware transformer for frame representation, a rank scorer for frame scoring, and includes a dynamic image construction module with encoder-decoder structure.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving by 4.05% on CASME II, 2.50% on SAMM, 7.71% on CAS(ME)^2, and 2.11% on CAS(ME)^3 datasets in F1-score. Also works well for dynamic image construction.

Conclusion: The proposed FDP framework effectively captures subtle facial actions associated with micro-expressions and alleviates data scarcity issues through dynamic image construction, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and Argoverse Odometry datasets with high efficiency (82ms inference time), demonstrating superior pose accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: DVLO4D provides an effective solution for visual-LiDAR odometry with high accuracy, robustness, and real-time deployment potential, addressing key challenges in autonomous system localization.

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

Result: General-purpose VLMs demonstrated practical capability for blood report analysis, providing clear interpretations directly from images.

Conclusion: VLMs establish a foundation for reliable AI-assisted healthcare applications, though results should be interpreted cautiously due to limited dataset size.

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the
limited dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyDef-DETR is a DETR-based framework for small-defect detection in UAV transmission line inspection, using stride-free downsampling, edge-enhanced convolution, dual-domain attention, and adaptive regression loss to improve detection of small defects against complex backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated UAV inspection of transmission lines faces challenges in detecting small, ambiguous defects due to detail loss from strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and insufficient integration of global context with local information.

Method: Proposes TinyDef-DETR with: 1) stride-free space-to-depth module for lossless downsampling, 2) edge-enhanced convolution for boundary-aware feature extraction, 3) cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention for global-local information integration, and 4) Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss for small object localization.

Conclusion: Integrating detail-preserving downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BranchGRPO reduces computational costs and improves training stability for image/video generative models by introducing branch sampling, tree-based advantage estimation, and pruning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GRPO methods suffer from high computational costs from on-policy rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due to sparse rewards.

Method: Proposes BranchGRPO with branch sampling policy that shares computation across common prefixes, prunes low-reward paths and redundant depths, and uses tree-based advantage estimator with dense process-level rewards.

Result: Improves alignment scores by 16% over strong baselines while cutting training time by 50% in image and video preference alignment experiments.

Conclusion: BranchGRPO effectively addresses computational efficiency and training stability issues in preference alignment while maintaining or improving exploration diversity.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Result: Experiments on real-world document datasets show substantial reduction in computational costs while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed token pruning framework effectively reduces compute burdens for VLMs in document understanding tasks without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands

TL;DR: Proposes multi-stage GNN with hierarchical pooling/unpooling for better thermal field prediction in natural convection, outperforming SOTA GNNs with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity CFD modeling is accurate but computationally expensive and requires expert knowledge. Conventional GNNs struggle with long-range dependencies in thermal-fluid simulations on irregular meshes.

Method: Novel multi-stage GNN architecture using hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial scales on mesh structures.

Result: Achieves higher predictive accuracy, improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared to state-of-the-art GNN baselines on CFD dataset of natural convection in rectangular cavities.

Conclusion: The multi-stage GNN approach shows strong potential for modeling complex heat transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations, offering an efficient alternative to traditional CFD methods.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Motivation: To improve reconstruction quality in projection-based nano- and microtomography, particularly for specimens with homogeneous material phases and sharp edges, by addressing blurriness and artifacts in existing methods.

Method: Train a neural network to identify edges within subpictures, then integrate this trained network into a mathematical optimization model that favors solutions based on learned predictions while allowing alternative solutions strongly supported by raw data.

Result: Significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms on experimental datasets, producing high-quality reconstructions with reduced blurriness.

Conclusion: The technique successfully incorporates knowledge about material homogeneity and sharp edges, eliminating blurriness and demonstrating potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedSeqFT is a sequential fine-tuning framework that outperforms existing methods for medical image segmentation, achieving 3.0% average Dice improvement while preserving pre-trained knowledge through MDS selection and K&G RFT components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning strategies for medical image segmentation either isolate tasks (parallel fine-tuning) or require simultaneous access to all datasets (multi-task fine-tuning), failing to effectively exploit shared knowledge and handle incremental task integration.

Method: Proposes MedSeqFT with two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection to identify representative downstream samples, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT) using LoRA-based knowledge distillation to balance task adaptation with knowledge retention.

Result: Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks show MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 3.0% average Dice improvement. Also enhances transferability on unseen tasks, particularly for tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: MedSeqFT establishes sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks, with demonstrated robustness and superior performance.

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Motivation: Current VL models struggle with complex reasoning needed for interpreting structured pathological reports due to high structural similarity and subtle morphological variations in tissue images.

Method: Introduces PathoHR-Bench benchmark for hierarchical semantic understanding evaluation, and a pathology-specific VL training scheme with enhanced/perturbed samples for multimodal contrastive learning.

Result: Existing VL models fail to model intricate cross-modal relationships effectively. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets.

Conclusion: The pathology-specific training scheme enables effective fine-grained pathology representation and addresses limitations of current VL models in clinical pathology applications.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic image clustering has limited application in image enhancement due to difficulty defining meaningful clusters for this specific task. Current approaches using semantic attributes are not optimal for enhancement purposes.

Method: Introduced CARDIE algorithm that clusters images based on color and luminosity content. Also developed a method to quantify the impact of enhancement algorithms on luminance distribution and local variance.

Result: CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than semantic-based clusters. These clusters can be used to resample enhancement datasets, improving performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms.

Conclusion: CARDIE provides effective unsupervised clustering for image enhancement tasks, with publicly released code to encourage adoption and ensure reproducibility.

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage

### [155] [SpecSwin3D: Generating Hyperspectral Imagery from Multispectral Data via Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06122)
*Tang Sui,Songxi Yang,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D is a transformer-based model that generates high-quality hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs, achieving superior spatial and spectral fidelity compared to previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a fundamental trade-off in remote sensing: multispectral imagery has high spatial resolution but limited spectral resolution, while hyperspectral imagery has rich spectral information but lower spatial resolution. Existing methods struggle to preserve both spatial detail and spectral fidelity.

Method: Transformer-based model that takes 5 multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at the same spatial resolution. Uses cascade training strategy to progressively expand spectral range and optimized band sequence to capture pairwise relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40Â°, and SSIM of 0.96, outperforming baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by more than half. Demonstrated practical value on downstream tasks including land use classification and burnt area segmentation.

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D effectively bridges the gap between multispectral and hyperspectral imagery, providing high-fidelity hyperspectral reconstruction with practical applications in environmental monitoring and analysis.

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RetinaGuard is a privacy framework that protects retinal age information in fundus images while maintaining diagnostic quality and utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI can extract sensitive biometric data like retinal age from medical images, creating privacy risks where unauthorized use could lead to bioinformation leakage and privacy breaches.

Method: Uses feature-level generative adversarial masking to obscure retinal age, plus a multiple-to-one knowledge distillation strategy with retinal foundation model and surrogate age encoders for universal defense against black-box age prediction models.

Result: Successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image quality and pathological feature representation.

Conclusion: RetinaGuard effectively protects biometric privacy in medical images and can be extended to protect other medical image-derived biomarkers.

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in instruction following and detail preservation in unified multimodal models compared to tightly coupled systems like GPT-4o, leveraging recent advances in interleaving reasoning.

Method: Introduces Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG) framework with text-based thinking and image synthesis alternation, trained using IRGL method with two sub-goals and IRGL-300K dataset covering six learning modes.

Result: Achieves SoTA performance with absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN benchmarks, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity.

Conclusion: Interleaving reasoning significantly improves text-to-image generation, demonstrating that alternating between text-based thinking and image synthesis enhances instruction following, detail preservation, and overall generation quality.

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Motivation: To create a unified model capable of simultaneous audio-video generation that avoids performance degradation from misaligned text annotations and leverages existing expert models efficiently.

Method: Uses stitching of experts (SoE) technique to fuse pre-trained video and music generation models, combined with an online annotation pipeline for accurate temporal alignment during training on 7,600 hours of audio-video data.

Result: Produces well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong alignment for speech generation, with performance approaching state-of-the-art models like Veo3.

Conclusion: The model successfully demonstrates coordinated audio-video generation through expert fusion and online annotation, with public release of model, code, and new benchmark dataset (Verse-Bench) to advance research in this field.

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

### [159] [UNO: Unifying One-stage Video Scene Graph Generation via Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06165)
*Huy Le,Nhat Chung,Tung Kieu,Jingkang Yang,Ngan Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO is a unified single-stage framework for both box-level and pixel-level Video Scene Graph Generation that uses slot attention and temporal consistency learning without explicit tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior VidSGG methods require task-specific architectures and multi-stage pipelines for different granularity levels (box vs pixel), lacking a unified approach.

Method: Extended slot attention decomposes features into object/relation slots. Object temporal consistency enforces frame-to-frame consistency without tracking. Dynamic triplet prediction links relations to object pairs over time.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on both box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks while offering improved efficiency through unified design.

Conclusion: UNO demonstrates that a single-stage, object-centric framework can effectively handle multiple VidSGG tasks with minimal task-specific modifications and maximum parameter sharing.

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

*Amna Hassan,Ilsa Afzaal,Nouman Muneeb,Aneeqa Batool,Hamail Noor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI-based fracture detection from X-rays using custom CNN achieves 95.96% accuracy, outperforming transfer learning models like EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50 on the FracAtlas dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address global health challenge of bone fractures, especially in low-resource settings with limited access to expert radiology services, overcoming limitations of conventional imaging methods (high cost, radiation exposure, specialized interpretation dependency).

Method: Developed custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked against transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50) using FracAtlas dataset with 4,083 anonymized musculoskeletal radiographs.

Result: Custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94 precision, 0.88 recall, and 0.91 F1-score. Transfer learning models performed poorly in this specific setup, which may be due to class imbalance and dataset limitations.

Conclusion: Lightweight CNNs show promise for fracture detection in X-rays, but successful clinical translation requires fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

*Lucas Wojcik,Luiz Coelho,Roger Granada,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient document detection pipeline adapted from license plate detection network (IWPOD-Net) for real-time document rectification, achieving competitive OCR performance with smaller model size than state-of-the-art solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time document detection and rectification is an unexplored niche despite being vital for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. Current approaches focus either on large models for performance or small models for efficiency, but not both for this specific application.

Method: Adapted IWPOD-Net (license plate detection network) and trained it on synthetic ID card dataset (NBID). Used data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV dataset. Evaluated OCR output quality using novel metric based on Levenshtein distance.

Result: The model is smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while maintaining competitive OCR quality. Document rectification doesn't need to be perfect to achieve state-of-the-art performance scores.

Conclusion: Proposed efficient document detection pipeline successfully balances model size and OCR performance, demonstrating that perfect rectification isn't necessary for optimal information retrieval from documents.

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

*Mohsen Gholami,Ahmad Rezaei,Zhou Weimin,Yong Zhang,Mohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ego3D-Bench is a new benchmark with 8,600+ QA pairs for evaluating VLMs' 3D spatial reasoning using ego-centric multi-view outdoor data. Results show significant performance gap between humans and current VLMs. Ego3D-VLM framework improves spatial reasoning by 12-56% using cognitive maps from estimated 3D coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs struggle with 3D spatial understanding, which is crucial for real-world embodied AI agents like robots and self-driving cars that rely on ego-centric multi-view observations rather than single images or indoor videos.

Method: Created Ego3D-Bench benchmark with human-annotated QA pairs, benchmarked 16 SOTA VLMs, and developed Ego3D-VLM - a post-training framework that generates cognitive maps based on estimated global 3D coordinates to enhance spatial reasoning.

Result: Significant performance gap between human level scores and VLMs. Ego3D-VLM achieved 12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on absolute distance estimation. The framework is modular and compatible with any existing VLM.

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM provide valuable tools for advancing toward human-level spatial understanding in real-world multi-view environments, addressing a major limitation of current vision-language models.

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

*Cecelia Soh,Rizhao Cai,Monalisha Paul,Dennis Sng,Alex Kot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First study to estimate skin hydration and trans-epidermal water loss from selfie facial images using a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model with contrastive regularization to address data imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin barrier function measured by SH and TEWL is crucial for health but requires specialized clinical instruments, making regular monitoring inaccessible to the general public.

Method: Proposed systematic solution with data collection, preprocessing, and novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model with symmetric-based contrastive regularization to handle annotation imbalance.

Result: Successfully developed AI model to estimate SH and TEWL from smartphone selfies, bridging computer vision and skincare research for accessible remote skin analysis.

Conclusion: Enables AI-driven skin health monitoring without physical measurements, making dermatological assessment accessible to broader users through smartphone technology.

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

### [164] [Prototype-Aware Multimodal Alignment for Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06291)
*Jiangnan Xie,Xiaolong Zheng,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAML is a novel framework that addresses limitations in open-vocabulary visual grounding through prototype-aware multimodal learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based VG methods perform well in standard scenes but struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to imperfect visual-linguistic alignment, insufficient cross-modal fusion, and ineffective use of semantic prototypes.

Method: Uses ALBEF for initial cross-modal alignment, Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder for salient object enhancement, prototype discovering/inheriting mechanism for semantic prototype aggregation, and Multi-stage Decoder for comprehensive multimodal integration.

Result: Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show competitive performance in standard scenes and state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scenes.

Conclusion: PAML effectively addresses key challenges in open-vocabulary visual grounding through systematic multimodal learning with prototype awareness, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

*Zhang Jing,Pu Nan,Xie Yu Xiang,Guo Yanming,Lu Qianqi,Zou Shiwei,Yan Jie,Chen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Video-GCD, extending Generalized Category Discovery to videos, and proposes MCCL framework with temporal-spatial consistency learning and memory enhancement for novel category discovery in videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static visual content alone is insufficient for reliable novel category discovery. The authors extend GCD to video domain to leverage temporal information for more accurate category discovery.

Method: Proposes Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework with two components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning (CACL) that uses temporal features to estimate consistency scores, and Memory-Guided Representation Enhancement (MGRE) with dual-level memory buffer for global context.

Result: The method significantly outperforms image-based GCD approaches on the new Video-GCD benchmark including action recognition and bird classification datasets, demonstrating the importance of temporal information.

Conclusion: Temporal information is crucial for discovering novel categories in videos, and the proposed MCCL framework effectively integrates multi-perspective temporal-spatial cues through consistency modeling and memory enhancement.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text4Seg++ proposes a text-as-mask paradigm that treats image segmentation as text generation using semantic descriptors, eliminating need for additional decoders and achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively integrating image segmentation into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) remains challenging, requiring a simpler approach that leverages existing language modeling capabilities without additional complex decoders.

Method: Uses semantic descriptors as textual representation of segmentation masks. Introduces image-wise descriptors with R-RLE compression, then refines to box-wise descriptors with semantic bricks for next-brick prediction, treating segmentation as text generation.

Result: Achieves strong segmentation performance across natural and remote sensing datasets, outperforms state-of-the-art models without task-specific fine-tuning, reduces descriptor length by 74% and accelerates inference by 3x.

Conclusion: The text-driven approach demonstrates effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability for image segmentation within MLLM framework, remaining compatible with existing backbones while simplifying the segmentation process.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based

counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification

*Tz-Ying Wu,Sharath Nittur Sridhar,Subarna Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GO-Tokenizer improves video understanding in Video-LLMs by encoding object information directly rather than using textual descriptions, reducing token length and noise while boosting performance across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-sensitive video understanding tasks benefit from grounded object information, but adding textual object descriptions to prompts increases token length and susceptibility to noise from object detection errors.

Method: Proposed GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight add-on module that uses off-the-shelf object detectors to encode compact object information on the fly, integrated with Video-LLMs during pretraining.

Result: Pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms vanilla Video-LLMs and text-based object description approaches, with gains generalizing across different models, datasets, and video understanding tasks like temporal localization and dense captioning.

Conclusion: Direct encoding of object information through GO-Tokenizer is more effective than textual descriptions for improving Video-LLM performance on time-sensitive video understanding tasks, offering better efficiency and noise robustness.

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Motivation: Existing CLIP-based FAS models underutilize patch embedding tokens and rely on single text prompts per class, limiting their ability to detect critical spoofing clues and generalize across domains.

Method: Proposes MVP-FAS with two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) for extracting detailed spatial features and global context from patch embeddings using diverse texts, and Multi-Text Patch Alignment (MTPA) for aligning patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments show MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing CLIP-based FAS models by leveraging multiple paraphrased texts and better utilizing patch embeddings, resulting in improved cross-domain anti-spoofing performance.

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Method: Proposed a unified deep learning network using ResNet-50 CNN architecture that integrates class-balancing learning, robust augmentation, and calibration methods to classify both histopathological slides (from PathMNIST) and colonoscopy video frames (from HyperKvasir dataset) in one pipeline.

Result: The study demonstrates an interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that successfully unifies multiple diagnostic modalities for colorectal disease detection.

Conclusion: This unified approach advances and eases the detection of colorectal diseases by combining multiple diagnostic modalities into a single, efficient pipeline that reduces variability and improves diagnostic workflow.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

*Aswini Kumar Patra,Lingaraj Sahoo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight hybrid CNN framework for drought stress detection that reduces parameters by 15x while maintaining accuracy, with machine unlearning for adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional drought detection methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive, while existing deep learning models require too many parameters for resource-limited agricultural settings.

Method: Proposed a novel lightweight hybrid CNN inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures, plus a gradient norm-based machine unlearning mechanism for targeted data removal.

Result: Achieved 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional CNN/Vision Transformer models while maintaining competitive accuracy on aerial potato field images.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision agriculture, especially under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SISR models struggle to generalize across varying scale factors, limiting their real-world applicability. Need for a solution that can retrofit existing models for multi-scale capability.

Method: Uses lightweight scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling with SimAM attention module and gradient variance loss for enhanced sharpness. Designed as plug-in module for various SR backbones.

Result: Enables multiple state-of-the-art SR models to perform competitive or superior arbitrary-scale SR across integer and non-integer factors with minimal computational cost.

Conclusion: SAAM provides a practical solution for real-world multi-scale super-resolution by efficiently retrofitting existing models without significant overhead.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated pipeline for analyzing brain metastases response to stereotactic radiosurgery using longitudinal MRI data, identifying 5 growth trajectories and achieving up to 0.90 AUC for 12-month response prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain metastases contribute significantly to cancer mortality, but analyzing longitudinal MRI follow-up images is too time-consuming for clinicians, leading to unannotated data and missed opportunities for early treatment response assessment.

Method: Implemented automated pipeline to curate longitudinal dataset of 896 brain metastases in 177 patients. Used data-driven clustering to identify growth trajectories and employed both classical gradient boosting and graph machine learning for 12-month response prediction using pre-treatment and first follow-up MRI.

Result: Identified 5 dominant growth trajectories with distinct final response categories. Achieved 0.90 AUC with gradient boosting and 0.88 AUC with graph machine learning for 12-month response prediction using only early imaging data.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable data curation and provides foundation for clinical decision support systems, offering potential for automated and precise assessment of brain metastases response to stereotactic radiosurgery.

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

### [176] [3DOF+Quantization: 3DGS quantization for large scenes with limited Degrees of Freedom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06400)
*Matthieu Gendrin,StÃ©phane Pateux,ThÃ©o Ladune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3D Gaussian Splatting for 3D scene reconstruction is effective for 6DoF views but limited in large scenes. A new spherical coordinate quantization scheme is proposed to handle position errors in 3DoF+ scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large scenes have input views from limited zones, making reconstruction valuable only for novel views from the same zone (3DoF+). Position errors in quantization impact projection accuracy, especially for distant points.

Method: Study the impact of position error on projection error, showing it's proportional to squared inverse distance. Propose a spherical coordinate quantization scheme to address this.

Result: The proposed quantization method improves rate-distortion performance, demonstrated on the Garden scene.

Conclusion: Spherical coordinate quantization effectively reduces projection errors in 3DoF+ scenarios for 3D Gaussian Splatting, enhancing performance in large scenes with limited view zones.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

*Hua Zhang,Changjiang Luo,Ruoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight is a novel VCOD method that combines SAM and MLLM to address edge separation and object-background separability issues in video camouflaged object detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SAM-based methods struggle with separating camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, while MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as they merge foreground and background information.

Method: The method uses temporal and spatial clues for video representation, performs feature fusion via LLM, employs dynamic foreground visual token scoring and prompt network to guide SAM, and implements a decoupled foreground-background learning strategy with separate cue generation and training.

Result: Experiments on MoCA-Mask dataset show state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and the method demonstrates strong generalization ability by detecting unseen camouflaged objects on CAD2016 dataset.

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight effectively addresses the key challenges in VCOD by combining SAM and MLLM strengths while mitigating their individual limitations, achieving superior performance and generalization in camouflaged object detection.

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: Zero-shot cattle muzzle detection using Grounding DINO vision-language model achieves 76.8% mAP@0.5 without annotated data or training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional muzzle detection methods require manual annotation and are labor-intensive, while supervised models need extensive annotated datasets and perform poorly on unseen cattle.

Method: Proposes a zero-shot framework using Grounding DINO vision-language model with natural language prompts to detect muzzles without task-specific training or annotated data.

Result: Achieves 76.8% mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5, demonstrating promising performance across diverse cattle breeds and environments without requiring annotated data.

Conclusion: First annotation-free solution for cattle muzzle detection, offering practical alternative to supervised methods with improved adaptability and ease of deployment in livestock monitoring.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

TL;DR: PBAN is a novel full-reference image quality assessment method for super-resolution images that uses bidirectional attention and multi-scale deformable convolution to better align with human visual perception of distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing full-reference image quality assessment metrics for comparing and evaluating different super-resolution algorithms are limited, creating a need for better assessment methods that align with human visual perception.

Method: Proposes Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network with three modules: image encoder, perception-oriented bidirectional attention module (using bidirectional attention, grouped multi-scale deformable convolution, and sub-information excitation convolution), and quality prediction module.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PBAN outperforms state-of-the-art quality assessment methods for super-resolution image evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed PBAN framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing SR IQA methods by incorporating human visual system characteristics and bidirectional attention mechanisms, achieving superior performance in quality assessment.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

TL;DR: Cross-source point cloud registration faces challenges due to lack of real-world datasets and sensor differences. The authors create Cross3DReg dataset and propose an overlap-based framework with visual-geometric attention for improved registration accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-source point cloud registration lacks large-scale real-world datasets and suffers from inherent sensor differences that negatively impact registration accuracy. The diverse patterns from different sensors make robust feature extraction and matching challenging.

Method: Constructed Cross3DReg dataset using rotating mechanical lidar and hybrid semi-solid-state lidar. Designed an overlap-based registration framework that uses unaligned images to predict overlapping regions, filtering redundant points. Proposed visual-geometric attention guided matching module to fuse image and geometric information for reliable correspondences.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 63.2% reduction in relative rotation error (RRE), 40.2% reduction in relative translation error (RTE), and 5.4% improvement in registration recall (RR).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses cross-source point cloud registration challenges by leveraging visual information to identify overlapping regions and fusing visual-geometric features, resulting in significantly improved registration accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Conclusion: The proposed affine transformation-based attacks are effective black-box adversarial methods that outperform existing approaches, providing valuable insights for both attacking and defending deep neural networks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial

especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101

TL;DR: CARVE is a training-free method that improves VLM performance in complex visual environments by using attention contrast to extract task-relevant signals from visual noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs perform poorly in complex visual environments, and existing enhancement methods require additional training, external tools, or operate at coarse levels while ignoring VLMs' innate capabilities.

Method: Analyze VLM attention patterns, discover correlation between visual complexity and attention entropy, then propose CARVE - a method that uses contrast between general and task-specific query attention maps to decompose visual signals into semantic components and noise at pixel level.

Result: CARVE consistently enhances performance with up to 75% improvement on open-source models without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: The work provides insights into visual complexity and attention mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning through attention contrasting.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv3, a self-supervised vision transformer trained on natural images, shows strong performance as a unified encoder for medical vision tasks without domain-specific pre-training, outperforming medical-specific models on some tasks but showing limitations in specialized domains like pathology and PET imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether state-of-the-art vision foundation models like DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, can effectively transfer to medical imaging domains without requiring domain-specific pre-training.

Method: Benchmarked DINOv3 across various medical vision tasks including 2D/3D classification and segmentation on multiple medical imaging modalities, systematically analyzing scalability by varying model sizes and input resolutions.

Result: DINOv3 demonstrates impressive performance and establishes a strong baseline, even outperforming medical-specific models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks. However, performance degrades in specialized domains like WSIs, EM, and PET, and scaling laws don't consistently apply in medical domain.

Conclusion: DINOv3 serves as a powerful baseline and robust visual prior for medical tasks, opening future directions like leveraging its features for 3D reconstruction consistency, despite limitations in highly specialized medical domains.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

*Zhongxiang Xie,Shuangxi Miao,Yuhan Jiang,Zhewei Zhang,Jing Yao,Xuecao Li,Jianxi Huang,Pedram Ghamisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSG-Net is a novel frequency-spatial synergistic network that addresses false alarms and semantic gap issues in remote sensing change detection through frequency domain processing, spatial attention, and gated fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two critical challenges in high-resolution remote sensing change detection: false alarms from radiometric variations and semantic gap between deep and shallow features that leads to poorly delineated boundaries.

Method: Proposes FSG-Net with three key components: 1) Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) for frequency domain processing to mitigate pseudo-changes, 2) Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM) to amplify genuine change regions, and 3) Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) to bridge semantic gap by selectively integrating details from shallow layers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CDD (94.16% F1), GZ-CD (89.51% F1), and LEVIR-CD (91.27% F1) benchmarks.

Conclusion: FSG-Net effectively disentangles semantic changes from nuisance variations and establishes new state-of-the-art performance in remote sensing change detection tasks.

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

*Andrea Marelli,Alberto Foresti,Leonardo Pesce,Giacomo Boracchi,Mario Grosso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Before-After Supervision for waste sorting automation, using visual differences between before/after operator action to train segmentation networks without extensive labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human operators are still needed for waste sorting, but fully supervised computer vision requires too much labeling. Weak supervision from operator removal actions is under-explored.

Method: Leverages visual differences between images before and after operator removal to train segmentation networks. Introduces WS^2 dataset with 11k+ frames and benchmarks state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods.

Result: Presents a complete pipeline and dataset for weakly supervised segmentation in waste sorting applications.

Conclusion: Before-After Supervision offers a viable alternative to fully supervised approaches for industrial quality control automation, reducing labeling requirements while maintaining accuracy.

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

*Jibai Lin,Bo Ma,Yating Yang,Rong Ma,Turghun Osman,Ahtamjan Ahmat,Rui Dong,Lei Wang,Xi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIDE framework enhances subject-driven image generation by balancing subject identity preservation with instruction compliance through target-supervised triplet alignment and preference learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to adequately address the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions in subject-driven image generation.

Method: TIDE uses target-supervised triplet alignment with (reference image, instruction, target images) triplets and Direct Subject Diffusion objective, training with paired "winning" (balanced) and "losing" (distorted) targets for implicit reward modeling.

Result: Superior performance on standard benchmarks, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics while maintaining subject faithfulness and instruction compliance.

Conclusion: TIDE effectively resolves the preservation-compliance tension without test-time fine-tuning and demonstrates versatility across diverse image generation tasks.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Automated MRI-based glioblastoma response classification using hybrid deep learning and radiomics features achieves 0.81 ROC AUC


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RANO criteria for glioblastoma therapy response assessment are complex and subjective, requiring automated objective methods

Method: Hybrid framework combining fine-tuned ResNet-18 deep features with 4800+ radiomic/clinical features including 3D tumor metrics, using CatBoost classifier

Result: 0.81 mean ROC AUC and 0.50 Macro F1 score for 4-class response prediction (Complete/Partial Response, Stable/Progressive Disease)

Conclusion: Combining learned image representations with domain-specific radiomic features provides robust automated treatment response assessment

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

*Hua Chang Bakker,Stan Fris,Angela Madelon Bernardy,Stan Deutekom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reproducibility study of FairCLIP finds discrepancies between paper description and implementation, creates aligned version A-FairCLIP and extension FairCLIP+, but results show neither improves fairness or performance despite reducing Sinkhorn distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the reproducibility of FairCLIP's claims about improving group fairness in CLIP models for medical image classification tasks.

Method: Reproduced FairCLIP experimental setup, identified implementation discrepancies, created aligned implementation A-FairCLIP, proposed extended version FairCLIP+ for multiple attributes, and evaluated impact on fairness and performance.

Result: Found CLIP exhibits demographic bias in zero-shot glaucoma classification, but FairCLIP (both original and aligned A-FairCLIP) did not improve performance or fairness despite reducing Sinkhorn distances.

Conclusion: The study could not reproduce FairCLIP's claimed improvements, suggesting the regularization objective reduces distance metrics but doesn't translate to actual fairness or performance gains in practice.

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces FMOX, a JSON metadata format with additional ground truth information for Fast Moving Objects (FMO) datasets, and shows that EfficientTAM foundational model performs comparably to specialized FMO tracking pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast and tiny object tracking remains challenging in computer vision, and there's a need for standardized metadata formats to facilitate better evaluation and comparison of tracking methods on FMO datasets.

Method: The authors created JSON metadata files (FMOX) with object size information for four open-source FMO datasets, then tested EfficientTAM foundational tracking model using these enhanced datasets and compared performance using Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores.

Result: EfficientTAM's performance compares well with pipelines originally tailored for these FMO datasets, demonstrating that foundational models can be effective for fast moving object tracking tasks.

Conclusion: The FMOX JSON format provides accessible and usable metadata for machine learning pipelines processing FMO datasets, and foundational tracking models like EfficientTAM show promising results comparable to specialized solutions.

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

*Emil DemiÄ,Luka Äehovin Zajc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust training approach for scene-level sketch-based image retrieval that handles sketch ambiguity and noise, achieving state-of-the-art results without complex architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the inherent ambiguity and noise in real-world sketches, which previous work overlooked by focusing mainly on architectural improvements rather than training robustness.

Method: Combination of appropriate pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation specifically designed to be robust to sketch variability, without introducing additional complexity.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging FS-COCO and widely-used SketchyCOCO datasets, demonstrating effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Training design plays a critical role in cross-modal retrieval tasks, and there's a need to improve evaluation scenarios for scene-level sketch-based image retrieval.

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

*Runqing Yang,Yimin Fu,Changyuan Wu,Zhunga Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RARL method for incremental open set recognition that maintains decision boundaries by aligning unknown representations around inactive prototypes in angular space, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OSR methods are designed for static scenarios but real-world applications require incremental identification of new unknown classes from continuous data streams while maintaining discriminability.

Method: Retentive Angular Representation Learning (RARL) with virtual-intrinsic interactive training strategy and stratified rectification to compact known representations and refine decision boundaries in angular space.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across various task setups on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets, establishing a new benchmark for IOSR.

Conclusion: RARL effectively mitigates representation drift and maintains discriminative decision boundaries in incremental open set recognition scenarios.

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of consensus on suitable vector ordering for morphological operators in vector-valued images like color and hyperspectral images

Method: Develop machine learning approach to learn reduced ordering that approximates Condorcet ranking derived from multiple vector orderings, inspired by voting problems

Result: Preliminary computational experiments confirm effectiveness of learning reduced mapping for defining vector-valued morphological operators

Conclusion: Proposed machine learning approach successfully approximates Condorcet ordering and enables effective vector-valued morphological operators for color image processing

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

TL;DR: CausNVS is an autoregressive multi-view diffusion model that generates novel views sequentially, supporting arbitrary input-output configurations and precise camera control through pairwise-relative pose encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-view diffusion models are non-autoregressive, limiting them to fixed view counts and suffering from slow inference due to simultaneous denoising of all frames, which restricts their applicability in world modeling.

Method: Uses causal masking and per-frame noise during training with pairwise-relative camera pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference, employs spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning augmentation to prevent drift.

Result: CausNVS supports diverse camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across various settings.

Conclusion: The autoregressive approach with causal masking and precise camera control enables more flexible and efficient multi-view synthesis compared to non-autoregressive methods, making it suitable for world modeling applications.

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsustainable wildlife trade is a major biodiversity threat, increasingly moving to digital marketplaces. Automated detection methods are needed to handle the large volume of digital content, especially for identifying wildlife products like ivory.

Method: Developed machine learning-based object recognition models using images of confiscated illegal wildlife products. Tested various training strategies and loss functions, creating both species-specific models and a combined model for elephant, pangolin, and tiger products.

Result: Best model achieved 84.2% overall accuracy with species-specific accuracies: 71.1% (elephant), 90.2% (pangolin), 93.5% (tiger). Smartphone application implementation showed 91.3% overall accuracy for real-time detection.

Conclusion: The machine learning approach effectively identifies wildlife products and can be deployed via smartphone app for real-time monitoring, making it applicable for both online trade monitoring and physical market surveillance.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

TL;DR: HSANet is a novel hybrid Swin attention network for LDCT/PET denoising that combines efficient global attention modules and hybrid upsampling to improve image quality while maintaining low radiation safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose CT and PET imaging reduce radiation exposure but result in increased noise and artifacts that compromise diagnostic accuracy, creating a need for effective denoising methods.

Method: Proposed Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet) with Efficient Global Attention modules for enhanced spatial/channel interaction and hybrid upsampling module to prevent noise overfitting.

Result: HSANet achieves superior denoising performance compared to existing methods while maintaining lightweight model size suitable for standard GPU deployment.

Conclusion: The approach is highly practical for real-world clinical applications, providing effective denoising for low-dose CT/PET imaging with computational efficiency.

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

TL;DR: Novel deep learning framework combining CNN and LSTM achieves 98% accuracy in classifying nitrogen stress severity under combined drought and weed competition stress using multi-modal imaging data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Plants face multiple interacting stresses in nature, with nitrogen deficiency becoming critical when compounded with drought and weed competition. Early detection is crucial for plant health protection and effective management strategies.

Method: Uses four imaging modalities (RGB, multispectral, and two infrared wavelengths) to capture physiological responses. Develops spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline combining CNN for spatial feature extraction and LSTM for temporal dependencies from time-series canopy images.

Result: CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved 98% accuracy, significantly outperforming spatial-only CNN model (80.45%) and previously reported machine learning methods (76%).

Conclusion: The approach effectively captures subtle interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed pressure, offering a promising tool for timely identification of nitrogen stress severity and improved crop management.

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Emma J Curtis,Samuel Simmons,Kazunori Nagano,Stan Brown,Adam Riese,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Location-based regularization improves self-supervised learning for seafloor image analysis, boosting CNN and ViT performance across diverse datasets with F1-score gains of 4.9-6.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance marine monitoring efficiency by improving high-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor imagery through location metadata integration in self-supervised learning.

Method: Evaluated impact of location-based regularization on six state-of-the-art SSL frameworks including CNN and ViT models with varying latent-space dimensionality across three diverse seafloor image datasets.

Result: Location-regularization consistently improved downstream classification performance with average F1-score gains of 4.9Â±4.0% for CNNs and 6.3Â±8.9% for ViTs. High-dimensional ViTs showed strong generalization matching best location-regularized SSL.

Conclusion: Location metadata provides valuable regularization for SSL, particularly beneficial for low-dimensional representations, while high-dimensional ViTs demonstrate excellent generalization capabilities for seafloor image analysis.

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

*Cailei Liang,Adrian Bodenmann,Sam Fenton,Blair Thornton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Online clustering framework for real-time unsupervised seafloor image analysis that adapts to continuous data streams with constant computational time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery in autonomous underwater vehicles to enable adaptive missions and optimize communication, overcoming limitations of offline methods that require complete datasets and human labeling.

Method: Online clustering framework (OCF) that operates unsupervised on continuous data streams, using representative sampling to capture evolving feature distributions, supporting dynamic cluster merging/splitting without reprocessing full history.

Result: Achieved highest average F1 score of 0.68 across three seafloor datasets with 3% standard deviation, demonstrating superior clustering and robustness to trajectory variation while maintaining bounded computational time.

Conclusion: OCF enables efficient survey data summaries and supports informative path planning for long-term autonomous marine exploration with real-time, scalable, and adaptive seafloor image interpretation.

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

*Shengkai Zhang,Yuhe Liu,Guanjun Wu,Jianhua He,Xinggang Wang,Mozi Chen,Kezhong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting framework that uses monocular images for novel-view synthesis in large scenes by combining sparse SfM depth with dense LFM depth estimates through object-segmented propagation and dynamic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting typically requires accurate depth from RGB-D/stereo cameras, which have limited range for large scenes. Monocular images lack depth guidance, while large foundation models for depth estimation suffer from inconsistency, inaccuracy for distant scenes, and texture ambiguity.

Method: Leverages accurate but sparse depth from visual-inertial SfM to refine dense but coarse depth from LFMs. Uses object-segmented depth propagation algorithm to bridge sparse input to dense output, and develops dynamic depth refinement module to handle dynamic objects and refine LFM depth.

Result: Experiments on public and customized datasets demonstrate superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VIM-GS successfully generates dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs, enabling high-quality Gaussian Splatting rendering in large scenes by effectively combining the strengths of SfM and LFM depth estimation techniques.

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time monitoring of bioprinting processes is crucial for maintaining print quality and biological viability, but challenging due to limited imaging data and resource-constrained hardware constraints.

Method: Proposed BioLite U-Net architecture using depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational load, trained on a novel manually annotated dataset of 787 RGB images with three classes (nozzle, bioink, background), benchmarked against MobileNet baselines.

Result: BioLite U-Net achieves 92.85% mIoU and 96.17% Dice score, is over 1300x smaller than MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+, and processes frames in 335 ms on Raspberry Pi 4B, demonstrating near real-time capability.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net offers superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

*Xichen Xu,Yanshu Wang,Jinbao Wang,Qunyi Zhang,Xiaoning Lei,Guoyang Xie,Guannan Jiang,Zhichao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE is a novel diffusion-based method for industrial anomaly synthesis that addresses limitations of existing approaches by incorporating background priors, graded diffusion, and explicit mask alignment to generate realistic, fine-grained anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SIAS methods lack intricate texture details, fail to align precisely with backgrounds, and struggle to generate pixel-level anomalies, limiting their effectiveness for downstream anomaly segmentation tasks.

Method: Proposes STAGE with three key components: anomaly inference strategy using clean background as prior, graded diffusion framework with anomaly-only branch to record local anomalies, and explicit mask alignment strategy for progressive background alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVTec and BTAD datasets show STAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS and enhances downstream anomaly segmentation.

Conclusion: STAGE effectively addresses critical limitations in industrial anomaly synthesis through its novel diffusion-based approach with background guidance and explicit alignment, demonstrating superior performance for anomaly segmentation applications.

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed an explainable deep learning model combining EfficientNetV2 with attention-based MLP-Mixer for brain tumor classification from MRI images, achieving 99.50% accuracy and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Brain tumors require early diagnosis but manual MRI examination is error-prone and requires expertise, creating a need for automated diagnostic systems.

Method: Used Figshare dataset with 3,064 T1-weighted MRI images. Evaluated 9 CNN architectures, selected EfficientNetV2 as backbone, integrated attention-based MLP-Mixer, and used Grad-CAM for visualization with 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Achieved 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision, 99.52% recall, and 99.49% F1 score, outperforming literature methods. Grad-CAM showed effective focus on relevant MRI regions.

Conclusion: The combined EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer model provides high accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for clinical decision support systems in brain tumor diagnosis.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zo3T is a zero-shot test-time training framework for trajectory-guided image-to-video generation that uses 3D-aware kinematic projection, dynamic LoRA adapters, and guidance field rectification to achieve realistic motion without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for trajectory-guided I2V generation either require expensive fine-tuning on scarce datasets or produce unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and creating misalignment between manipulated latents and noise predictions.

Method: Three core innovations: 1) 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection using scene depth for perspective-correct transformations, 2) Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA with dynamic adapters and regional feature consistency loss, 3) Guidance Field Rectification with one-step lookahead strategy.

Result: Zo3T significantly enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses challenges in zero-shot trajectory-guided video generation by ensuring generative fidelity, on-manifold adherence, and efficient progression towards target trajectories without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Co-Seg framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation in histopathology images using mutual enhancement between tasks with region-aware prompts and cross-guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing studies treat tissue semantic segmentation and nuclei instance segmentation separately, ignoring their inherent relationship and resulting in insufficient histopathology understanding.

Method: Proposes a co-segmentation paradigm with region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) for semantic/instance region prompts, and mutual prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) for cross-guidance and contextual consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on PUMA dataset show Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-art methods in semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei instances.

Conclusion: The collaborative approach between tissue and nuclei segmentation tasks through mutual enhancement significantly improves histopathology image analysis performance.

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sensing approaches for UAV forest navigation suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence on ambient light, especially under forest canopies where reliable perception is critical for environmental monitoring and search/rescue operations.

Method: Uses structured light with modulated wavelength projection to simultaneously capture depth information and spectral data across 650-850nm bands. A portable RGB (3-wavelength) version was deployed in real rainforest environments for validation.

Result: Demonstrated 60% RMSE improvement over commercial depth sensors, validated spectral accuracy against reference instruments, and showed 30% accuracy improvement in material differentiation (leaves vs branches) when combining depth with spectral data compared to color-only methods.

Conclusion: The system provides lightweight, integrated, and robust perception for UAVs in complex natural environments, enabling high-performance depth estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation with a single sensor solution.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature

in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study.
Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network

exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other

analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer
learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model
exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification

particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

TL;DR: Novel framework for detecting dark humor in memes using multimodal reasoning and role-reversal self-loop refinement, with a new annotated dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dark humor in online memes presents unique challenges due to implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues, with existing methods lacking resources for multimodal dark humor detection.

Method: Proposes a reasoning-augmented framework using Large Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Role-Reversal Self-Loop for explanation refinement, Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) for fusing text, image, and reasoning features via pairwise attention mechanisms.

Result: Outperforms strong baselines across three tasks: dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses multimodal dark humor understanding, with released dataset and code to facilitate further research in content moderation and humor analysis.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

*Muhammad Shahbaz,Shaurya Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanTwin datasets are high-fidelity synthetic replicas of three real roadside lidar datasets, created using realistic digital twins that accurately model geometry, road alignment, and traffic patterns to enhance training for 3D perception tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create synthetic datasets that can effectively replace or augment real-world lidar datasets for 3D perception tasks, addressing data scarcity and enabling testing of custom scenarios through digital twin technology.

Method: Synthesized datasets using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins modeled based on actual locations' geometry, road alignment, lane topology, and vehicle movement patterns. Includes 10K annotated frames per dataset with 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation, tracking IDs, and semantic segmentation.

Result: High similarity scores between synthetic and real data, and improved 3D object detection performance when models trained solely on synthetic data were tested on real, unseen data compared to models trained on real data.

Conclusion: UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmarks by increasing sample size and scene diversity, and represent the first digitally synthesized datasets capable of replacing in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks.

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMO is a unified multi-identity optimization framework that addresses identity confusion in image customization by reformulating multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem using reinforcement learning on diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans are highly sensitive to faces, making identity preservation challenging in image customization. Current methods struggle with maintaining consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion when using multiple reference images, limiting identity scalability.

Method: UMO uses a 'multi-to-multi matching' paradigm to treat multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem. It employs reinforcement learning on diffusion models and includes a scalable dataset with both synthesized and real multi-reference images for training.

Result: Extensive experiments show UMO significantly improves identity consistency and reduces identity confusion across several image customization methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in identity preservation among open-source methods.

Conclusion: UMO successfully addresses the challenge of identity confusion in multi-reference image customization, providing a scalable solution that maintains high-fidelity identity preservation while being generally applicable to existing customization methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in automated video age-rating: large labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature learning for MPAA standards.

Method: Contrastive learning with three frameworks (Instance Discrimination, Contextual, Multi-View) using LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with Bahdanau attention mechanism. Evaluated NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet loss functions.

Result: State-of-the-art performance with 88% accuracy and 0.8815 F1 score, particularly excels in fine-grained distinctions like PG-13 vs R-rated content.

Conclusion: Proposed architecture provides efficient automated content compliance solution, successfully deployed as real-time web application for streaming platforms.

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating

Motivation: Current AI radiology models are narrow and single-task, which is impractical for covering the vast spectrum of imaging modalities and diseases. Foundation models promise broad generalization but this potential hasn't been realized in radiology.

Method: Trained Curia foundation model on the entire cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years - the largest corpus of real-world radiology data (150,000 exams, 130TB). Validated on a new 19-task external benchmark.

Result: Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts tumor staging outcomes. It meets or surpasses radiologist performance and recent foundation models, showing emergent cross-modality and low-data capabilities.

Conclusion: Curia demonstrates clinically significant emergent properties and represents a major advancement in radiology AI. The model weights are publicly released to accelerate progress in the field.

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models

cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.

TL;DR: Using V-JEPA foundation model for surgical data science, showing that domain adaptation through finetuning on surgical videos and integrating multimodal OR data improves performance on tasks like hospital stay prediction and phase recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how transfer learning of foundation models and integration of complementary OR modalities can enhance surgical data science applications.

Method: Used V-JEPA as foundation model, finetuned on unlabeled surgical videos, integrated additional time-resolved OR data streams, and tested on liver surgery videos (hospital stay/complication prediction) and HeiCo dataset (phase recognition).

Result: Finetuning on domain-specific data improved performance. Multimodal integration benefited in-house data. Video-only baseline matched top EndoVis2017 challenge performance, with further improvement after finetuning.

Conclusion: Surgical data science can leverage public foundation models, with domain adaptation and multimodal integration showing significant potential for improving surgical support systems.

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to machine learning models by
introducing carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification. While
prior work has primarily focused on MNIST and similar datasets, this paper
investigates the vulnerability of traffic sign classifiers using the LISA
Traffic Sign dataset. We train a convolutional neural network to classify 47
different traffic signs and evaluate its robustness against Fast Gradient Sign
Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning framework ARTSS automates rheumatoid arthritis severity scoring from hand X-rays, achieving high accuracy with Vision Transformer model and addressing challenges like joint disappearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual scoring of rheumatoid arthritis severity using Total Sharp Score is time-consuming and subjective, with inter- and intra-observer variability issues that need automation.

Method: Four-stage framework: 1) Image pre-processing with ResNet50, 2) Hand segmentation with UNet.3, 3) Joint identification with YOLOv7, 4) TSS prediction using multiple models including VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformer.

Result: Joint identification achieved 99% accuracy. Vision Transformer performed best with Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Validated on 970 patients with 3-fold cross-validation and external testing on 291 unseen subjects.

Conclusion: Deep learning can effectively automate RA scoring, reducing variability, saving time, improving accuracy, and aiding clinical decision-making while handling challenges like joint disappearance and variable image sequences.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

TL;DR: A topology-adaptive deformation model for non-rigid 3D mesh matching that handles topological artifacts and works without data-driven priors, outperforming learning-based methods on noisy multi-view reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing real-world scenarios like per-frame multi-view reconstructions that suffer from topological artifacts, where current approaches (Functional Maps and ARAP-like methods) fail due to their restrictive assumptions about deformation and topology.

Method: Proposes a topology-adaptive deformation model that allows changes in shape topology while maintaining ARAP and bijective association constraints. Jointly optimizes for a template mesh with adequate topology and its alignment with target shapes to extract correspondences.

Result: The approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and shapes with topological artifacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view reconstructions. It outperforms methods trained on large datasets in 3D alignment quality without relying on any data-driven prior.

Conclusion: The proposed topology-adaptive deformation model effectively handles topological artifacts in 3D mesh matching, demonstrating superior performance on challenging real-world data compared to both traditional and learning-based approaches.

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes selective GAN deblurring + YOLOv5 for ALPR system achieving 95-97% accuracy with 0.026s detection time, improving blurred plate recognition by 40%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR is crucial for smart cities but faces challenges with high variability and blurred inputs that deep learning can address more efficiently.

Method: Selective GAN deblurring preprocessing + YOLOv5 for license plate detection, character segmentation, and recognition with Iranian license plate datasets.

Result: 0.026s detection time, 95% LPD accuracy, 97% CR accuracy, 40% improvement on blurred plates with Deblur-GAN preprocessing.

Conclusion: YOLOv5 provides excellent precision and speed for portable ALPR applications, enhanced by selective GAN preprocessing for blurred inputs.

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

*Morteza Kiani Haftlang,Mohammadhossein Malmir,Foroutan Parand,Umberto Michelucci,Safouane El Ghazouali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight real-time medical image segmentation model combining Swin Transformer encoder with U-Net decoder, using self-supervised pretraining with Barlow Twins for efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical segmentation models have limited receptive fields (U-Net) or are computationally expensive (transformers), making them unsuitable for real-time clinical use.

Method: Combines Swin Transformer-like encoder with U-Net-like decoder via skip connections. Uses Barlow Twins self-supervised pretraining on encoder before fine-tuning for binary segmentation.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameters and faster inference compared to existing models like Swin Transformer and U-Net.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, efficient alternative for real-time medical image segmentation in resource-limited clinical environments.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

*Minheng Chen,Youyong Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 2D/3D registration method using spherical feature spaces and Riemannian distances in SO(4) space for better manifold structure preservation and faster convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Euclidean approximations in similarity learning distort manifold structure and slow convergence in intraoperative 2D/3D registration, limiting accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Extract feature embeddings using CNN-Transformer encoder, project into spherical space, approximate geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in bi-invariant SO(4) space, and use differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization during inference.

Result: Superior accuracy achieved on both real and synthetic datasets in patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.

Conclusion: Spherical feature spaces with Riemannian geometry provide more expressive and geometrically consistent similarity metrics, enhancing pose distinction and accelerating convergence in 2D/3D registration.

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

TL;DR: BIR-Adapter is a low-complexity adapter for diffusion models that enables blind image restoration without training auxiliary feature extractors, achieving competitive performance with significantly lower complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage pre-trained diffusion models for blind image restoration tasks without the need for additional feature extractor training, reducing complexity while maintaining performance.

Method: Extracts features from degraded images using the pre-trained model itself, extends self-attention mechanism with degraded features, and introduces a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.

Result: Achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world degradations while having significantly lower complexity.

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter's adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion models, expanding applications in image restoration and allowing super-resolution models to handle additional unknown degradations.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

TL;DR: FoMo4Wheat is a crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained on the largest wheat image dataset (ImAg4Wheat) that outperforms general-domain models across 10 in-field vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-domain pretrained models fail to generalize across agricultural vision tasks due to fine canopy structures and fluctuating field conditions in digital agriculture.

Method: Self-supervised pretraining on ImAg4Wheat dataset (2.5M high-res wheat images from 30 global sites, 2000+ genotypes, 500+ environmental conditions collected over a decade).

Result: FoMo4Wheat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general-domain models across 10 canopy and organ-level vision tasks, showing robustness for wheat and transferability to other crops/weeds.

Conclusion: Crop-specific foundation models provide reliable in-field perception and pave the way for universal crop foundation models with cross-species and cross-task capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

### [230] [H$_{2}$OT: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Video Pose Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06956)
*Wenhao Li,Mengyuan Liu,Hong Liu,Pichao Wang,Shijian Lu,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HâOT is a hierarchical plug-and-play framework that prunes redundant pose tokens in video transformers and recovers full sequences, improving efficiency for 3D human pose estimation while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video pose transformers (VPTs) have high computational costs that make them impractical for resource-constrained devices, despite their success in 3D human pose estimation.

Method: Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (HâOT) with Token Pruning Module (TPM) to select representative tokens and Token Recovering Module (TRM) to restore full-length sequences, working with both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency, showing that maintaining full pose sequences is unnecessary and a few representative tokens achieve high accuracy.

Conclusion: HâOT provides an efficient plug-and-play framework that can be easily incorporated into common VPT models, enabling fast inference while maintaining estimation accuracy through strategic token pruning and recovery.

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

### [231] [ProtSAE: Disentangling and Interpreting Protein Language Models via Semantically-Guided Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05309)
*Xiangyu Liu,Haodi Lei,Yi Liu,Yang Liu,Wei Hu*

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: ProtSAE is a semantically-guided sparse autoencoder that uses domain knowledge and annotation data during training to address semantic entanglement in protein language models, producing more interpretable biological features while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) applied to protein language models suffer from semantic entanglement where neurons mix multiple nonlinear concepts, making reliable interpretation and manipulation difficult.

Method: Proposed ProtSAE guides semantic disentanglement during training using both annotation datasets and domain knowledge, rather than requiring annotation data only for post-training filtering and interpretation.

Result: ProtSAE learns more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features, maintains high reconstruction fidelity, achieves better interpretable probing results, and shows potential for steering PLMs in downstream generation tasks.

Conclusion: ProtSAE effectively addresses semantic entanglement in protein language model interpretation by incorporating semantic guidance during training, resulting in more meaningful and interpretable feature representations.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) has emerged as a powerful tool for mechanistic
interpretability of large language models. Recent works apply SAE to protein
language models (PLMs), aiming to extract and analyze biologically meaningful
features from their latent spaces. However, SAE suffers from semantic
entanglement, where individual neurons often mix multiple nonlinear concepts,
making it difficult to reliably interpret or manipulate model behaviors. In
this paper, we propose a semantically-guided SAE, called ProtSAE. Unlike
existing SAE which requires annotation datasets to filter and interpret
activations, we guide semantic disentanglement during training using both
annotation datasets and domain knowledge to mitigate the effects of entangled
attributes. We design interpretability experiments showing that ProtSAE learns
more biologically relevant and interpretable hidden features compared to
previous methods. Performance analyses further demonstrate that ProtSAE
maintains high reconstruction fidelity while achieving better results in
interpretable probing. We also show the potential of ProtSAE in steering PLMs
for downstream generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code-switching presents challenges for ASR systems, especially for Vietnamese-English pairs with distinct phonological features and similar sound recognition ambiguity. Existing methods fail to capture subtle phonological shifts in CS scenarios.

Method: Two-stage phoneme-centric architecture using extended Vietnamese phoneme set as intermediate representation for mixed-lingual modeling. Enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion.

Result: TSPC consistently outperforms baselines including PhoWhisper-base, achieving significantly lower word error rate of 20.8% with reduced training resources.

Conclusion: The phonetic-based two-stage architecture effectively enhances ASR performance in complex Vietnamese-English code-switching scenarios through phoneme adaptation and language conversion.

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle
phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly
difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct
phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition
are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for
Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC
employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme
set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing
baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a
significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources.
Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme
adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS
Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directed energy deposition (DED) is highly susceptible to process-induced defects like geometric deviations, lack of fusion, and poor surface finish, requiring effective in-situ monitoring solutions.

Method: Developed a fringe projection system synchronized with build height for layer-wise surface reconstruction. Introduced two geometry-based point cloud metrics: local point density (for surface finish) and normal-change rate (for lack-of-fusion defects).

Result: Achieved reconstruction accuracy of Â±46Î¼m. Enabled automated, annotation-free identification of deposition anomalies without manual labeling. Successfully linked geometric deviation to defect formation for precise anomaly localization.

Conclusion: Establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging process signatures with part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing and advancing closed-loop process control feasibility.

Abstract: Directed energy deposition (DED), a metal additive manufacturing process, is
highly susceptible to process-induced defects such as geometric deviations,
lack of fusion, and poor surface finish. This work presents a
build-height-synchronized fringe projection system for in-situ, layer-wise
surface reconstruction of laser-DED components, achieving a reconstruction
accuracy of ${\pm}$46 ${\mu}$m. From the reconstructed 3D morphology, two
complementary geometry-based point cloud metrics are introduced: local point
density, which highlights poor surface finish, and normal-change rate, which
identifies lack-of-fusion features. These methods enable automated,
annotation-free identification of common deposition anomalies directly from
reconstructed surfaces, without the need for manual labeling. By directly
linking geometric deviation to defect formation, the approach enables precise
anomaly localization and advances the feasibility of closed-loop process
control. This work establishes fringe projection as a practical tool for
micrometer-scale monitoring in DED, bridging the gap between process signatures
and part geometry for certifiable additive manufacturing.

TL;DR: BinaryShield is a privacy-preserving threat intelligence system that enables secure sharing of prompt injection attack fingerprints across regulatory compliance boundaries while protecting user privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM services face security blind spots because privacy regulations prevent sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection attacks across compliance boundaries, allowing the same threats to persist undetected in different services.

Method: BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and randomized response mechanism to generate non-invertible fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while ensuring privacy.

Result: Achieves F1-score of 0.94 (significantly outperforming SimHash baseline at 0.77), with 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared to dense embeddings.

Conclusion: BinaryShield effectively enables cross-boundary threat intelligence sharing for LLM security while maintaining privacy compliance and achieving superior performance metrics.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of LLMs across enterprise services has created a
critical security blind spot. Organizations operate multiple LLM services
handling billions of queries daily, yet regulatory compliance boundaries
prevent these services from sharing threat intelligence about prompt injection
attacks, the top security risk for LLMs. When an attack is detected in one
service, the same threat may persist undetected in others for months, as
privacy regulations prohibit sharing user prompts across compliance boundaries.
  We present BinaryShield, the first privacy-preserving threat intelligence
system that enables secure sharing of attack fingerprints across compliance
boundaries. BinaryShield transforms suspicious prompts through a unique
pipeline combining PII redaction, semantic embedding, binary quantization, and
randomized response mechanism to potentially generate non-invertible
fingerprints that preserve attack patterns while providing privacy. Our
evaluations demonstrate that BinaryShield achieves an F1-score of 0.94,
significantly outperforming SimHash (0.77), the privacy-preserving baseline,
while achieving 64x storage reduction and 38x faster similarity search compared
to dense embeddings.

TL;DR: This paper introduces an LLM-based approach using Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages for insider threat detection, achieving better performance than GPT-4o across multiple metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing insider threat research relies on static, limited-access datasets, restricting the development of adaptive detection models. There's a need for dynamic, ethically-grounded approaches to generate realistic data for improved threat detection.

Method: Uses Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages with 1% insider threat indicators reflecting real-world data distributions. Both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o were evaluated using precision, recall, MCC, and ROC AUC metrics.

Result: Claude Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy.

Conclusion: LLMs show strong promise for synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection, with Claude Sonnet 3.7 demonstrating superior performance over GPT-4o in this domain.

Abstract: Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of
identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is
dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological,
and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been
generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which
restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a
novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM)
Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which
contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world
data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs
were analyzed for insider threats by both Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with
their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including precision,
recall, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across
nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving
detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in
synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

### [237] [Tell-Tale Watermarks for Explanatory Reasoning in Synthetic Media Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05753)
*Ching-Chun Chang,Isao Echizen*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: A tell-tale watermarking system is developed to trace the generation chain of synthetic media by embedding interpretable watermarks that evolve with transformations, enabling forensic analysis of composite edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of synthetic media and complex editing applications has blurred reality, fueling an infodemic and eroding public trust, creating a need for forensic tools to reconstruct manipulation chains and detect criminal intent.

Method: Developed a tell-tale watermarking system with watermarks tailored to different transformation classes (semantic edits, photometric adjustments, geometric projections) that evolve synchronously with carrier media and leave interpretable traces when transformed.

Result: Experimental evaluations demonstrate the system's validity with respect to fidelity (quality preservation), synchronicity (consistent evolution with media), and traceability (ability to reconstruct transformation chains).

Conclusion: The tell-tale watermarking approach provides explanatory reasoning capabilities for forensic analysis of synthetic media, successfully addressing the inverse problem of tracing generation chains through interpretable watermark responses to transformations.

Abstract: The rise of synthetic media has blurred the boundary between reality and
fabrication under the evolving power of artificial intelligence, fueling an
infodemic that erodes public trust in cyberspace. For digital imagery, a
multitude of editing applications further complicates the forensic analysis,
including semantic edits that alter content, photometric adjustments that
recalibrate colour characteristics, and geometric projections that reshape
viewpoints. Collectively, these transformations manipulate and control
perceptual interpretation of digital imagery. This susceptibility calls for
forensic enquiry into reconstructing the chain of events, thereby revealing
deeper evidential insight into the presence or absence of criminal intent. This
study seeks to address an inverse problem of tracing the underlying generation
chain that gives rise to the observed synthetic media. A tell-tale watermarking
system is developed for explanatory reasoning over the nature and extent of
transformations across the lifecycle of synthetic media. Tell-tale watermarks
are tailored to different classes of transformations, responding in a manner
that is neither strictly robust nor fragile but instead interpretable. These
watermarks function as reference clues that evolve under the same
transformation dynamics as the carrier media, leaving interpretable traces when
subjected to transformations. Explanatory reasoning is then performed to infer
the most plausible account across the combinatorial parameter space of
composite transformations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the validity of
tell-tale watermarking with respect to fidelity, synchronicity and
traceability.

TL;DR: This paper proposes converting malware binaries into 1D signals instead of 2D images for classification, avoiding information loss from quantization noise and 2D reshaping heuristics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a custom 1D CNN architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional malware classification faces limitations: static analysis is evaded by obfuscation techniques, while dynamic analysis is too resource-intensive. Existing 2D image conversion approaches suffer from significant information loss due to quantization noise and artificial 2D dependencies.

Method: Convert malware binaries into 1D signals stored in floating-point format to avoid quantization noise. Adapt existing 2D CNN architectures for 1D signals and develop a bespoke 1D convolutional neural network based on ResNet architecture with squeeze-and-excitation layers.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance on MalNet dataset with F1 scores of 0.874 (binary classification), 0.503 (type classification), and 0.507 (family classification).

Conclusion: The proposed 1D signal modality avoids information loss from traditional 2D conversion methods and enables improved malware classification performance, paving the way for future models to operate on this signal representation.

Abstract: Malware classification is a contemporary and ongoing challenge in
cyber-security: modern obfuscation techniques are able to evade traditional
static analysis, while dynamic analysis is too resource intensive to be
deployed at a large scale. One prominent line of research addresses these
limitations by converting malware binaries into 2D images by heuristically
reshaping them into a 2D grid before resizing using Lanczos resampling. These
images can then be classified based on their textural information using
computer vision approaches. While this approach can detect obfuscated malware
more effectively than static analysis, the process of converting files into 2D
images results in significant information loss due to both quantisation noise,
caused by rounding to integer pixel values, and the introduction of 2D
dependencies which do not exist in the original data. This loss of signal
limits the classification performance of the downstream model. This work
addresses these weaknesses by instead resizing the files into 1D signals which
avoids the need for heuristic reshaping, and additionally these signals do not
suffer from quantisation noise due to being stored in a floating-point format.
It is shown that existing 2D CNN architectures can be readily adapted to
classify these 1D signals for improved performance. Furthermore, a bespoke 1D
convolutional neural network, based on the ResNet architecture and
squeeze-and-excitation layers, was developed to classify these signals and
evaluated on the MalNet dataset. It was found to achieve state-of-the-art
performance on binary, type, and family level classification with F1 scores of
0.874, 0.503, and 0.507, respectively, paving the way for future models to
operate on the proposed signal modality.

### [239] [Are LLM Agents Behaviorally Coherent? Latent Profiles for Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03736)
*James Mooney,Josef Woldense,Zheng Robert Jia,Shirley Anugrah Hayati,My Ha Nguyen,Vipul Raheja,Dongyeop Kang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM agents show internal inconsistencies across different experimental settings, failing to maintain behavioral consistency despite generating human-like survey responses, which limits their ability to substitute real human participants in research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLM-based synthetic agents can truly substitute real human participants in research by examining if they maintain internal consistency across different experimental conditions, rather than just matching human survey responses.

Method: Developed a study to reveal agents' internal states and examine their behavior in basic dialogue settings, testing behavioral hypotheses to assess consistency between conversation behavior and revealed internal states across different model families and sizes.

Result: Found significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across all tested model families and sizes. While agents could generate responses matching human counterparts, they failed to maintain internal consistency in different experimental settings.

Conclusion: LLM agents cannot accurately substitute for real human participants in research due to fundamental internal inconsistencies, representing a critical limitation in their capabilities despite their ability to generate human-like survey responses.

Abstract: The impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have fueled the
notion that synthetic agents can serve as substitutes for real participants in
human-subject research. In an effort to evaluate the merits of this claim,
social science researchers have largely focused on whether LLM-generated survey
data corresponds to that of a human counterpart whom the LLM is prompted to
represent. In contrast, we address a more fundamental question: Do agents
maintain internal consistency, retaining similar behaviors when examined under
different experimental settings? To this end, we develop a study designed to
(a) reveal the agent's internal state and (b) examine agent behavior in a basic
dialogue setting. This design enables us to explore a set of behavioral
hypotheses to assess whether an agent's conversation behavior is consistent
with what we would expect from their revealed internal state. Our findings on
these hypotheses show significant internal inconsistencies in LLMs across model
families and at differing model sizes. Most importantly, we find that, although
agents may generate responses matching those of their human counterparts, they
fail to be internally consistent, representing a critical gap in their
capabilities to accurately substitute for real participants in human-subject
research. Our simulation code and data are publicly accessible.

TL;DR: REER is a new paradigm that reverse-engineers reasoning processes from known-good solutions to create scalable deep reasoning datasets for open-ended creative tasks, outperforming traditional RL and distillation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional reasoning methods (RL and instruction distillation) struggle with open-ended creative generation due to unclear reward signals, expensive training, and teacher model limitations.

Method: REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER) works backwards from known-good solutions to computationally discover latent step-by-step reasoning processes, creating large-scale reasoning trajectory datasets.

Result: Created DeepWriting-20K dataset with 20K reasoning trajectories. DeepWriter-8B model trained on this data outperforms open-source baselines and competes with proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Conclusion: REER provides a scalable, gradient-free approach to instill deep reasoning in models for open-ended creative tasks, overcoming limitations of traditional forward-building methods.

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EDIT is a test-time scaling method that helps large reasoning models find the shortest correct reasoning paths by balancing correctness and brevity, reducing overthinking and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from overthinking - they overcomplicate simple problems with excessive strategy switching and convoluted reasoning, which harms interpretability and efficiency.

Method: Proposed EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming), a constraint-guided generation method that jointly tracks length and answer distributions under varying constraints to identify optimal reasoning paths.

Result: Extensive experiments show EDIT substantially enhances reasoning efficiency, producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user experience across diverse models and datasets.

Conclusion: EDIT effectively mitigates the overthinking problem in large reasoning models by enabling them to find the shortest correct reasoning paths, balancing conciseness and correctness.

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

TL;DR: Developing autonomous single-agent models for deep research using continual reinforcement learning with synthetic data, achieving 28.7% on benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable large language models to perform complex deep research tasks autonomously without multi-agent systems or manual directives, focusing on dynamic action determination.

Method: Continual reinforcement learning applied to reasoning-optimized models using entirely synthetic data, with minimal web crawling and Python tool integration for autonomous single-agent deep research.

Result: Best model SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% performance on Humanity's Last Exam benchmark, demonstrating enhanced agentic skills while preserving reasoning ability.

Conclusion: The proposed RL recipe with synthetic data effectively enhances autonomous deep research capabilities in single-agent models, providing a promising approach for agentic AI development.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

TL;DR: This survey paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of reinforcement learning foundations for deep research systems, covering data synthesis, RL methods, training systems, and evaluation benchmarks for agentic AI that performs complex multi-step tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep research systems rely on supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment methods that suffer from imitation bias, exposure bias, and weak credit assignment for long-horizon tasks. RL offers better alignment with tool-interaction research by enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment.

Method: The survey systematizes work along three axes: (1) data synthesis and curation, (2) RL methods covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward design, and multimodal integration, and (3) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. It also covers architecture, coordination, and evaluation benchmarks.

Result: The paper distills recurring patterns, identifies infrastructure bottlenecks, and provides practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents using reinforcement learning methods.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning provides a more effective foundation for deep research systems compared to SFT and DPO approaches, enabling better exploration, credit assignment, and reduced dependence on human priors and biases for complex multi-step research tasks.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intelligent vehicle cockpits require coordination across complex subsystems, but traditional function calling approaches operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls that lead to inefficiency and limited error recovery.

Method: Created VehicleWorld environment with 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties. Proposed State-based Function Call (SFC) that maintains explicit system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve target conditions.

Result: SFC significantly outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy and reduced latency. Direct state prediction was found to outperform function calling for environmental control.

Conclusion: The State-based Function Call approach with explicit state awareness provides more efficient and accurate control for intelligent vehicle cockpits compared to traditional stateless function calling methods.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

*Chenyang Zhu,Spencer Hong,Jingyu Wu,Kushal Chawla,Charlotte Tang,Youbing Yin,Nathan Wolfe,Erin Babinsky,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAFFLES is an evaluation architecture that uses iterative reasoning and refinement to identify failures in long-horizon LLM agentic systems, significantly outperforming existing baselines on fault detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation methods for LLM agentic systems are limited to single metrics and end-to-end outcomes, lacking the ability to systematically identify where and why complex multi-component systems fail over long horizons.

Method: RAFFLES operates as an iterative pipeline with a central Judge that investigates faults and specialized Evaluators that assess both system components and the Judge's reasoning quality, building a history of hypotheses.

Result: RAFFLES achieved 43% agent-step fault pair accuracy on Algorithmically-Generated dataset (vs 16.6% previous best) and 20% on Hand-Crafted dataset (vs 8.8% previous best) on the Who&When benchmark.

Conclusion: RAFFLES represents a significant advancement in automated fault detection for autonomous systems, moving beyond labor-intensive manual review and enabling systematic diagnosis of complex agent failures.

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

*James Xu Zhao,Bryan Hooi,See-Kiong Ng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Test-time scaling (extended reasoning chains) doesn't consistently improve accuracy on knowledge-intensive tasks and often increases hallucinations, though it remains beneficial compared to no thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether test-time scaling (increased inference-time computation through longer reasoning chains) is effective for knowledge-intensive tasks where factual accuracy and low hallucination rates are critical.

Method: Comprehensive evaluation using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive benchmarks, analyzing how extended reasoning affects hallucination behavior through case studies and behavioral analysis.

Result: Increasing test-time computation doesn't consistently improve accuracy and often leads to more hallucinations. Reduced hallucinations come from models choosing to abstain rather than improved factual recall, while longer reasoning can encourage attempts on unanswered questions that result in hallucinations.

Conclusion: While test-time scaling has limitations for knowledge-intensive tasks (increased hallucinations, confirmation bias), enabling thinking remains beneficial compared to not using reasoning chains at all.

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Motivation: Research papers require substantial effort to understand and adapt code/data/methods, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. The goal is to transform passive research artifacts into active systems that accelerate downstream use and discovery.

Method: Systematically analyzes papers and associated codebases using multiple agents to construct Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs connect to chat agents to handle complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking original paper tools.

Result: Successfully created agents leveraging AlphaGenome for genomic variant interpretation, and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE for single-cell/spatial transcriptomics analyses. These agents can reproduce original paper results and correctly handle novel user queries.

Conclusion: Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination by turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, creating a foundation for collaborative AI co-scientists ecosystem.

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own

challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into

Method: Multi-agent system that edits bicycle facilities directly on street-view imagery, integrating lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation, and automated evaluation to synthesize contextually appropriate designs.

Result: Experiments across diverse urban scenarios show the system adapts to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, producing visually coherent and instruction-compliant results.

Conclusion: Establishes foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design, enabling more efficient public engagement processes.

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus only on cognitive-level modifications but lack deeper meta-cognitive processes for knowledge editing in multimodal LLMs.

Method: Proposed MIND framework with meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, game-theoretic interactions for knowledge activation monitoring, and label refinement for noise-robust updates.

Result: MIND significantly outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The CogEdit benchmark and MIND framework successfully address the gap in meta-cognitive knowledge editing evaluation and performance.

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Abstract: In environments where visual sensors falter, in-air sonar provides a reliable

performance of these models in 2D is largely enabled by extensive, readily
available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained
foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this
domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce
high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural
language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would
enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized
counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and
enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in
realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this
challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D
counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form
language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with
enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to
improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the
first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied
specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional
modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure.
Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework
successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating
high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically
generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven
disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.

### [252] [A Synthetic-to-Real Dehazing Method based on Domain Unification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05374)
*Zhiqiang Yuan,Jinchao Zhang,Jie Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A domain unification method for synthetic-to-real image dehazing that addresses performance degradation due to distribution shift between synthetic and real hazy images caused by imperfect clean data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based dehazing methods suffer from performance degradation when applied to real-world hazy images due to distribution shift. This shift comes from imperfect collection of clean data that doesn't strictly meet ideal conditions, making atmospheric physics models inconsistent between real and synthetic domains.

Method: Proposes a synthetic-to-real dehazing method based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between real and synthetic domains to make the dehazing model more aligned with actual situations.

Result: Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

Conclusion: The domain unification approach effectively bridges the gap between synthetic and real domains for image dehazing, leading to superior performance on real-world hazy images compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Due to distribution shift, the performance of deep learning-based method for
image dehazing is adversely affected when applied to real-world hazy images. In
this paper, we find that such deviation in dehazing task between real and
synthetic domains may come from the imperfect collection of clean data. Owing
to the complexity of the scene and the effect of depth, the collected clean
data cannot strictly meet the ideal conditions, which makes the atmospheric
physics model in the real domain inconsistent with that in the synthetic
domain. For this reason, we come up with a synthetic-to-real dehazing method
based on domain unification, which attempts to unify the relationship between
the real and synthetic domain, thus to let the dehazing model more in line with
the actual situation. Extensive experiments qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate that the proposed dehazing method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on real-world images.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FASL-Seg model improves surgical scene segmentation by using dual processing streams for different feature resolutions, achieving SOTA results on EndoVis datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing surgical segmentation models focus mainly on tools and overlook anatomical objects, while struggling to balance high-level contextual features with low-level edge features.

Method: Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg) with two distinct processing streams: Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) for varying feature resolutions.

Result: Achieves mIoU of 72.71% on parts/anatomy segmentation (EndoVis18), improving SOTA by 5%. Also achieves 85.61% and 72.78% mIoU on tool type segmentation for EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 respectively.

Conclusion: Dual processing streams for varying feature resolutions enable precise segmentation of both anatomy and surgical instruments, demonstrating consistent performance across different classes.

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep
learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough
understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic
segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on
surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level
contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive
Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple
levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level
Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream,
for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and
surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark
datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model
achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy
segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU
of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation,
respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class
SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for
anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing
streams for varying feature resolutions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Federated learning outperforms centralized and local learning for tooth segmentation in dental radiographs across various data corruption scenarios while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy constraints, heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI by comparing federated learning with centralized and local learning approaches.

Method: Used Attention U-Net trained on 2066 radiographs from six institutions across four scenarios: baseline, label manipulation, image-quality manipulation, and faulty client exclusion. Implemented FL via Flower AI framework with per-client training monitoring and evaluated using Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD metrics.

Result: FL consistently achieved the best performance across all scenarios: baseline (Dice: 0.94889), label manipulation (Dice: 0.94884), image noise (Dice: 0.94853), and faulty-client exclusion (Dice: 0.94790). Loss-curve monitoring reliably detected corrupted sites.

Conclusion: FL matches or exceeds centralized learning and outperforms local learning while preserving privacy. Per-client loss trajectories provide effective anomaly detection, supporting FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for clinical AI deployment.

Abstract: Objectives: Federated learning (FL) may mitigate privacy constraints,
heterogeneous data quality, and inconsistent labeling in dental diagnostic AI.
We compared FL with centralized (CL) and local learning (LL) for tooth
segmentation in panoramic radiographs across multiple data corruption
scenarios. Methods: An Attention U-Net was trained on 2066 radiographs from six
institutions across four settings: baseline (unaltered data); label
manipulation (dilated/missing annotations); image-quality manipulation
(additive Gaussian noise); and exclusion of a faulty client with corrupted
data. FL was implemented via the Flower AI framework. Per-client training- and
validation-loss trajectories were monitored for anomaly detection and a set of
metrics (Dice, IoU, HD, HD95 and ASSD) was evaluated on a hold-out test set.
From these metrics significance results were reported through Wilcoxon
signed-rank test. CL and LL served as comparators. Results: Baseline: FL
achieved a median Dice of 0.94889 (ASSD: 1.33229), slightly better than CL at
0.94706 (ASSD: 1.37074) and LL at 0.93557-0.94026 (ASSD: 1.51910-1.69777).
Label manipulation: FL maintained the best median Dice score at 0.94884 (ASSD:
1.46487) versus CL's 0.94183 (ASSD: 1.75738) and LL's 0.93003-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-2.11462). Image noise: FL led with Dice at 0.94853 (ASSD: 1.31088); CL
scored 0.94787 (ASSD: 1.36131); LL ranged from 0.93179-0.94026 (ASSD:
1.51910-1.77350). Faulty-client exclusion: FL reached Dice at 0.94790 (ASSD:
1.33113) better than CL's 0.94550 (ASSD: 1.39318). Loss-curve monitoring
reliably flagged the corrupted site. Conclusions: FL matches or exceeds CL and
outperforms LL across corruption scenarios while preserving privacy. Per-client
loss trajectories provide an effective anomaly-detection mechanism and support
FL as a practical, privacy-preserving approach for scalable clinical AI
deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MM-DINOv2 adapts DINOv2 vision foundation model for multi-modal medical imaging with patch embeddings, full-modality masking for missing data, and semi-supervised learning, achieving 11.1% improvement in glioma classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 are designed for uni-modal image analysis but struggle with multi-modal medical imaging tasks and missing modalities common in clinical settings. Supervised models fail to leverage unlabeled data and handle missing modalities effectively.

Method: Proposes MM-DINOv2 framework with multi-modal patch embeddings to process multi-modal imaging data, full-modality masking to handle missing modalities and learn cross-modality relationships, and semi-supervised learning to utilize unlabeled datasets.

Result: Achieves Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on external test set for glioma subtype classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, surpassing state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging that addresses real-world clinical challenges like missing data and limited annotations while leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models.

Abstract: Vision foundation models like DINOv2 demonstrate remarkable potential in
medical imaging despite their origin in natural image domains. However, their
design inherently works best for uni-modal image analysis, limiting their
effectiveness for multi-modal imaging tasks that are common in many medical
fields, such as neurology and oncology. While supervised models perform well in
this setting, they fail to leverage unlabeled datasets and struggle with
missing modalities, a frequent challenge in clinical settings. To bridge these
gaps, we introduce MM-DINOv2, a novel and efficient framework that adapts the
pre-trained vision foundation model DINOv2 for multi-modal medical imaging. Our
approach incorporates multi-modal patch embeddings, enabling vision foundation
models to effectively process multi-modal imaging data. To address missing
modalities, we employ full-modality masking, which encourages the model to
learn robust cross-modality relationships. Furthermore, we leverage
semi-supervised learning to harness large unlabeled datasets, enhancing both
the accuracy and reliability of medical predictions. Applied to glioma subtype
classification from multi-sequence brain MRI, our method achieves a Matthews
Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.6 on an external test set, surpassing
state-of-the-art supervised approaches by +11.1%. Our work establishes a
scalable and robust solution for multi-modal medical imaging tasks, leveraging
powerful vision foundation models pre-trained on natural images while
addressing real-world clinical challenges such as missing data and limited
annotations.

*Clint Hurshman,Sebastian Porsdam Mann,Julian Savulescu,Brian D. Earp*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLM use in research writing can be considered analogous to senior authorship under specific conditions, challenging current authorship criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the controversy around LLM use in academic writing and provide a framework for legitimate authorship when using AI tools.

Method: Analogical argument comparing LLM use to senior authorship roles where researchers guide projects and vouch for integrity without writing content.

Result: Establishes that LLM use for generating complete drafts can be legitimate authorship according to accepted criteria in many research fields.

Conclusion: Either LLM use should be recognized as legitimate authorship or current authorship criteria require fundamental revision.

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and
medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some
circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether
and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is
distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including
paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and
ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper,
we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of
senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete
drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship
according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such
use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship
require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for efficient long-range dependency capture in vision-driven robotics while reducing computational latency and memory footprint, enabling robust performance in complex environments with obstacles and uneven terrain.

Method: Embeds proprioceptive states with MLP, patchifies depth images with lightweight CNN, uses stacked Mamba layers for token fusion via selective scanning, and trains end-to-end with PPO under terrain/appearance randomization and obstacle-density curriculum.

Result: Achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions compared to SOTA baselines, demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and converges in fewer updates under same compute budget.

Conclusion: LocoMamba provides an efficient and effective framework for vision-driven locomotion that combines near-linear-time processing with robust performance and strong generalization capabilities in challenging environments.

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in robotic manipulation and limitations of existing 2D trajectory methods that suffer from 3D spatial ambiguity.

Method: Combines 3D occupancy map reconstruction from input images, optimized 3D end-effector trajectory planning, and a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model with latent editing techniques.

Result: Superior visual quality compared to existing methods, generates plausible 3D robotic manipulation videos with autonomous trajectory planning.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses 3D spatial ambiguity in robotic manipulation video generation and significantly reduces human intervention requirements.

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Motivation: Current LLM evaluations for autonomous vehicles are limited to synthetic datasets without ground truth knowledge of how existing perception/planning algorithms would perform in those cases.

Method: Proposed architecture combines open vocabulary object detector with prompt engineering and LLM contextual reasoning to evaluate state-of-the-art models on real edge cases.

Result: The study provides qualitative comparison results of various LLMs tested against real-world edge cases where autonomous vehicles have proven to fail.

Conclusion: Discussion on findings suggests potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles, addressing real-world failure scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide

TL;DR: eKalibr-Inertial is an accurate spatiotemporal calibration method for event-based visual-inertial systems using circle grid boards, featuring rigorous initialization and continuous-time batch optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and low power consumption, but require accurate spatiotemporal calibration with inertial sensors for optimal visual-inertial fusion in ego-motion estimation applications.

Method: Builds upon grid pattern recognition from eKalibr/eKalibr-Stereo, uses rigorous initialization to recover all parameters, followed by continuous-time-based batch optimization to refine parameters.

Result: Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration capabilities.

Conclusion: The method provides effective calibration for event-based visual-inertial systems and is open-sourced to benefit the research community.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

TL;DR: Using 3D generative models to augment single real-world demonstrations for training omnidirectional robot policies that work from diverse starting positions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D generative models enable creating full object shapes from few images, opening opportunities to reduce the number of demonstrations needed for robot policy learning by generating diverse training data.

Method: Augmenting a dataset from a single real-world demonstration using 3D generative models, then training an omnidirectional policy within this imagined dataset to handle far-from-demonstration starting states.

Result: Enables robots to perform tasks from states far from observed demonstrations (including opposite sides of objects), significantly reducing required demonstrations. Superior performance shown in grasping, drawer opening, and trash placement tasks compared to alternative data augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 3D generative models effectively enable omnidirectional policy learning from minimal demonstrations, reducing the data collection burden while maintaining robust performance across diverse starting conditions.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing baselines in both accuracy and generalization capability for 3D object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: The approach effectively bridges perception and action for object interactions, enhancing LLMs' ability to reason about object relationships and generate task-specific constraint functions.

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

*Yuqing Wen,Hebei Li,Kefan Gu,Yucheng Zhao,Tiancai Wang,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLaDA-VLA is the first vision-language-diffusion-action model that adapts pretrained diffusion-based VLMs for robotic manipulation, achieving state-of-the-art performance through localized token classification and hierarchical action decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While masked diffusion models have shown competitive performance in text generation and multimodal applications, their application to robot policy learning remains unexplored despite the progress in auto-regressive vision-language models for robotics.

Method: Two key designs: (1) localized special-token classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with special action token classification to reduce adaptation difficulty; (2) hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences hierarchically considering dependencies within and across actions.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language-action models on both simulation and real-world robots.

Conclusion: LLaDA-VLA successfully bridges the gap between diffusion-based vision-language models and robotic manipulation, establishing a new paradigm for vision-language-action models using diffusion architecture.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: F1 is a pretrained Vision-Language-Action framework that integrates visual foresight generation into decision-making, using next-scale prediction to synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as planning targets, enabling foresight-guided action generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models use reactive state-to-action mappings that lead to short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic visual environments, creating a need for more predictive and robust approaches.

Method: F1 uses a Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception, foresight generation, and control. It employs next-scale prediction for goal-conditioned visual foresight and reformulates action generation as foresight-guided inverse dynamics. Trained on 330k+ trajectories across 136 tasks in three stages.

Result: Extensive evaluations show F1 consistently outperforms existing approaches with substantial gains in both task success rate and generalization ability on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Integrating visual foresight generation into the decision-making pipeline enables more robust and generalizable embodied AI capabilities, with F1 demonstrating superior performance over reactive approaches in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

TL;DR: DRP is a visuo-motor neural motion policy that generates reactive motion in dynamic environments using point cloud input, combining a pretrained transformer policy with reactive goal-proposal for improved obstacle avoidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical motion planners require full environment knowledge and are too slow for dynamic scenes, while neural policies struggle with generalization in complex dynamic settings.

Method: Combines IMPACT (transformer-based neural policy pretrained on 10M expert trajectories) with iterative student-teacher finetuning for static avoidance, and DCP-RMP reactive goal-proposal module for dynamic obstacle avoidance.

Result: Outperforms prior classical and neural methods in success rate across simulated and real-world settings with challenging dynamic obstacles and cluttered scenes.

Conclusion: DRP demonstrates strong generalization capabilities for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic environments using raw sensory inputs.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

*Yan-Shan Lu,Miguel Arana-Catania,Saurabh Upadhyay,Leonard Felicetti*

TL;DR: Semi-Global Matching with superpixel refinement improves Mars rover terrain mapping by addressing limitations of traditional block-matching methods, achieving better structural consistency and detail capture in challenging terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stereo matching methods for Mars rover navigation struggle with low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns due to limited context understanding, requiring more robust terrain modeling for safe autonomous navigation.

Method: Uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based refinement to balance efficiency and accuracy, adding context-aware segmentation for more coherent depth inference and reduced block artifacts.

Result: Evaluated on three datasets including Mars analogue terrain, showing improved structural consistency in sloped/occluded regions, reduced gaps behind rocks, and more accurate surface detail capture. Achieved competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and full-image error metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides a complete terrain modeling pipeline suitable for future planetary exploration missions, offering more precise and reliable disparity maps for autonomous navigation on Mars.

Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe
rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes.
Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing
scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching.
State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local
block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities
via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with
low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers
only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene
context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based
refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details.
The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware
segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has
been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue,
the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in
sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in
raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and
edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the
method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps
and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous
navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and
full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling
process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D
navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in
future planetary exploration missions.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates significant language biases in existing MLIR systems and validates the effectiveness of the novel LaKDA loss function in improving language fairness, highlighting the need for continued focus on equitable multilingual information retrieval.

Abstract: Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is
crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages.
This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in

the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR
neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a
novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our
analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with
notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SKEL is a new parametric 3D human model that re-rigs SMPL with a biomechanically accurate skeleton, enabling more realistic human articulation for biomechanics applications while maintaining ease of use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing body models like SMPL have simplified kinematic structures that don't correspond to true human skeletal anatomy, limiting their use in biomechanics. Current biomechanically accurate methods require complex motion capture systems and expensive optimization.

Method: Built a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. Learned a regressor from SMPL vertices to optimized joint locations and bone rotations, then re-parametrized SMPL with the new kinematic parameters.

Result: SKEL has more biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, with bones fitting better inside the body surface. It enables upgrading existing human pose datasets to include biomechanical parameters with fewer, more realistic degrees of freedom.

Conclusion: SKEL provides a tool for biomechanics in the wild and offers vision/graphics researchers a better constrained, more realistic model of human articulation that bridges the gap between computer vision and biomechanics.

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

TL;DR: A transformer-based method for novel view synthesis that uses synthetic data from diffusion models and token disentanglement to improve generalization and reconstruction quality, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large transformer models for novel view synthesis are limited by the diversity of available scene datasets, making real-world scenes out-of-distribution. Synthetic data from diffusion models can help but introduces artifacts that affect reconstruction quality.

Method: Proposes a token disentanglement process within transformer architecture to enhance feature separation and enable effective learning from synthetic data generated by diffusion models.

Result: Outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs.

Conclusion: The combination of synthetic training data from diffusion models with token disentanglement in transformers enables scalable training and improved generalization for novel view synthesis, making real-world scenes more accessible.

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

TL;DR: A language-native database system for boron nitride nanosheet polymer composites that captures structured information from research papers and enables accurate literature synthesis through semantic retrieval and RAG techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chemical research relies heavily on narrative descriptions that limit what conventional databases and machine learning can exploit, creating a need for structured language-based data organization.

Method: Developed a heterogeneous database that captures lightly structured information from papers across preparation, characterization, theory-computation, and mechanistic reasoning with evidence-linked snippets, using composite retrieval with semantics, keywords and value filters.

Result: The system can synthesize literature into accurate, verifiable, expert-style guidance and enables high-fidelity Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-augmented agents for actionable standard operating procedures.

Conclusion: This framework provides the language-rich foundation required for LLM-driven materials discovery by organizing chemical research knowledge in a structured, queryable format that bridges narrative descriptions with computational analysis.

Abstract: Chemical and materials research has traditionally relied heavily on knowledge
narrative, with progress often driven by language-based descriptions of
principles, mechanisms, and experimental experiences, rather than tables,
limiting what conventional databases and ML can exploit. We present a
language-native database for boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer thermally
conductive composites that captures lightly structured information from papers
across preparation, characterization, theory-computation, and mechanistic
reasoning, with evidence-linked snippets. Records are organized in a
heterogeneous database and queried via composite retrieval with semantics, key
words and value filters. The system can synthesizes literature into accurate,
verifiable, and expert style guidance. This substrate enables high fidelity
efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool augmented agents to
interleave retrieval with reasoning and deliver actionable SOP. The framework
supplies the language rich foundation required for LLM-driven materials

*Yuda Song,Julia Kempe,Remi Munos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL improves LLM reasoning but reduces diversity. Outcome-based exploration with UCB bonuses and batch penalties maintains accuracy while preserving diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL post-training enhances reasoning accuracy but causes diversity collapse, which undermines real-world performance where diversity is critical for test-time scaling.

Method: Propose outcome-based exploration with two algorithms: historical exploration (UCB-style bonuses for rare answers) and batch exploration (penalizing within-batch repetition).

Result: Experiments on math tasks with Llama and Qwen models show both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse.

Conclusion: Outcome-based exploration provides a practical RL approach that enhances reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

*Xiang Yuan,Jun Shu,Deyu meng,Zongben Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel robust fine-tuning method that preserves out-of-distribution robustness by constraining function space distance and adding consistency regularization, outperforming existing methods across CLIP backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust fine-tuning methods that preserve pretrained weights, features, or logits cannot consistently improve OOD robustness across different model architectures, as they serve as poor proxies for function space optimization.

Method: Proposes two regularizations: 1) constrains distance between fine-tuning and pre-trained models in function space using simulated OOD samples, and 2) consistency regularization to promote stable predictions for perturbed samples.

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach consistently improves both in-distribution fine-tuning performance and OOD robustness across various CLIP backbones, outperforming existing regularization-based methods.

Conclusion: The proposed function space regularization approach effectively preserves pre-trained model's OOD robustness while achieving competitive downstream task performance, demonstrating superior performance over current methods.

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent is an LLM-powered multi-agent system that automates model compression through profiling-guided pruning and quantization, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than uniform heuristics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models face compute and memory bottlenecks on resource-limited platforms, and existing compression techniques use uniform heuristics that ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity.

Method: A profiling-guided, agentic approach using LLMs to automate compression via structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization, reasoning over static metrics (MACs, parameters) and dynamic signals (latency, memory).

Result: Maintains competitive accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on smaller datasets), achieves up to 74% memory savings with <0.5% accuracy loss, and yields consistent inference speedups up to 1.74x faster.

Conclusion: Agentic systems are scalable solutions for profiling-guided model optimization, with LLM reasoning quality being crucial for iterative pruning success.

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

*Misgina Tsighe Hagos,Claes LundstrÃ¶m*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conformal prediction sets show weak correlation with human-annotated aleatoric uncertainty, questioning their effectiveness in capturing inherent dataset ambiguity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To validate whether conformal prediction sets effectively quantify aleatoric uncertainty (inherent class ambiguity) as claimed in literature, by comparing them against human annotations.

Method: Used three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight deep learning models on four datasets with multiple human annotations per instance, measuring correlation between prediction set sizes and human-assigned distinct labels.

Result: Vast majority of conformal prediction outputs showed very weak to weak correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate correlation.

Conclusion: Conformal predictors provide higher true class coverage but have limited capability in capturing aleatoric uncertainty, necessitating critical reassessment of their prediction sets.

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

TL;DR: A new redundancy index rho(C) that directly quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies in latent representations, providing a compact and statistically grounded measure of representational quality that predicts model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering generalization. Standard metrics like accuracy or reconstruction loss only provide indirect evidence of such redundancy.

Method: Introduces a redundancy index rho(C) that analyzes coupling matrices derived from latent representations and compares their off-diagonal statistics against a normal distribution via energy distance.

Result: Low rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse. The measure works across discriminative and generative settings on multiple datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: rho(C) exposes redundancy as a universal bottleneck across models and tasks, offering both a theoretical lens and practical tool for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations, with potential applications in neural architecture search and regularization.

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

TL;DR: Persona is a novel personalized method that uses prototype-based parameter editing to enhance on-device model generalization without retraining, addressing real-time data distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device real-time data distribution shifts challenge lightweight model generalization, and current data-intensive fine-tuning approaches are computationally expensive and impractical for post-deployment scenarios.

Method: Uses a neural adapter in the cloud to generate parameter editing matrices based on real-time device data, clustering models into prototypes that are dynamically refined. Incorporates cross-layer knowledge transfer for consistent multi-layer parameter changes.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision and recommendation tasks across multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and generality in adapting to data distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Persona provides an efficient backpropagation-free framework for enhancing on-device model generalization without post-deployment retraining, effectively addressing real-time data distribution challenges.

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

### [279] [On the Contribution of Lexical Features to Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05634)
*David Combei*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: Lexical content from speech can outperform acoustic models in speech emotion recognition, achieving 51.5% WF1 vs 49.3% for acoustic-only on MELD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether lexical content extracted from speech can compete with or outperform traditional acoustic-based approaches in speech emotion recognition, challenging the assumption that paralinguistic cues are primary drivers.

Method: Used lexical-based approach with different self-supervised speech and text representations, conducted layer-wise study of transformer-based encoders, and evaluated audio denoising effects.

Result: Lexical-based approach achieved 51.5% weighted F1-score on MELD dataset, outperforming acoustic-only pipeline (49.3%) despite having smaller parameter count.

Conclusion: Lexical content plays a significant role in speech emotion recognition and can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to acoustic models, suggesting both modalities should be considered in SER systems.

Abstract: Although paralinguistic cues are often considered the primary drivers of
speech emotion recognition (SER), we investigate the role of lexical content
extracted from speech and show that it can achieve competitive and in some
cases higher performance compared to acoustic models. On the MELD dataset, our
lexical-based approach obtains a weighted F1-score (WF1) of 51.5%, compared to
49.3% for an acoustic-only pipeline with a larger parameter count. Furthermore,
we analyze different self-supervised (SSL) speech and text representations,
conduct a layer-wise study of transformer-based encoders, and evaluate the
effect of audio denoising.

TL;DR: Beamforming-LLM is a system that uses spatial audio and AI to help users recall missed conversations through natural language queries, providing summaries and audio playback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of missing important conversations in multi-speaker environments and enable semantic recall of auditory information users may have missed.

Method: Combines microphone array beamforming for directional audio separation, Whisper for transcription, vector database for semantic retrieval, and GPT-4o-mini for generating contrastive summaries with spatial context and timestamped audio playback.

Result: A user-friendly interface that supports natural language queries and provides comprehensive recall of missed conversations with spatial and temporal context.

Conclusion: This system establishes the foundation for intelligent auditory memory systems with applications in assistive technology, meeting summarization, and context-aware spatial computing.

Abstract: We present Beamforming-LLM, a system that enables users to semantically
recall conversations they may have missed in multi-speaker environments. The
system combines spatial audio capture using a microphone array with
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to support natural language queries such
as, "What did I miss when I was following the conversation on dogs?"
Directional audio streams are separated using beamforming, transcribed with
Whisper, and embedded into a vector database using sentence encoders. Upon
receiving a user query, semantically relevant segments are retrieved,
temporally aligned with non-attended segments, and summarized using a
lightweight large language model (GPT-4o-mini). The result is a user-friendly
interface that provides contrastive summaries, spatial context, and timestamped
audio playback. This work lays the foundation for intelligent auditory memory
systems and has broad applications in assistive technology, meeting
summarization, and context-aware personal spatial computing.
