Conclusion: INSEva addresses the gap in insurance-specific AI evaluation and reveals that while LLMs have basic insurance knowledge, they struggle with complex real-world applications, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarks.

Abstract: Insurance, as a critical component of the global financial system, demands
high standards of accuracy and reliability in AI applications. While existing
benchmarks evaluate AI capabilities across various domains, they often fail to
capture the unique characteristics and requirements of the insurance domain. To
address this gap, we present INSEva, a comprehensive Chinese benchmark
specifically designed for evaluating AI systems' knowledge and capabilities in
insurance. INSEva features a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy covering
business areas, task formats, difficulty levels, and cognitive-knowledge
dimension, comprising 38,704 high-quality evaluation examples sourced from
authoritative materials. Our benchmark implements tailored evaluation methods
for assessing both faithfulness and completeness in open-ended responses.
Through extensive evaluation of 8 state-of-the-art Large Language Models
(LLMs), we identify significant performance variations across different
dimensions. While general LLMs demonstrate basic insurance domain competency
with average scores above 80, substantial gaps remain in handling complex,
real-world insurance scenarios. The benchmark will be public soon.

### [3] [Do MLLMs Really Understand the Charts?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04457)
*Xiao Zhang,Dongyuan Li,Liuyu Xiang,Yao Zhang,Cheng Zhong,Zhaofeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLLMs struggle with non-annotated charts due to reliance on recognition over reasoning. ChartReasoner mimics human visual reasoning and achieves superior performance on new benchmark CRBench, even outperforming GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs show alarming hallucinations and performance degradation when handling non-annotated charts, raising questions about whether they truly understand charts or just rely on recognition.

Method: Proposed ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding estimation in chart understanding, establishing comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to evaluate visual reasoning abilities.

Result: ChartReasoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, and demonstrates strong visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension with significant performance gains.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner enables MLLMs to rationally understand charts through visual reasoning rather than just recognition, providing a more human-like approach to chart comprehension.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
increasingly impressive performance in chart understanding, most of them
exhibit alarming hallucinations and significant performance degradation when
handling non-annotated charts. Therefore, a question arises: Do MLLMs really
understand the charts? Since a human is capable of understanding charts and
estimating the values by visual reasoning, we first carefully establish a
comprehensive Chart Reasoning Benchmark CRBench to rigorously evaluate the
visual reasoning abilities of MLLMs on non-annotated charts. We argue that
MLLMs are primarily relying on recognition rather than reasoning to interpret
the charts. To steer MLLMs to reasonable chart understanding, we propose
ChartReasoner that mimics human behavior by grounding their estimation in chart
understanding. Extensive results on the proposed CRBench show that
ChartReasnoner-3B/7B achieves superior performance in chart reasoning, even
compared to GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash. More importantly, ChartReasnoner also
demonstrates the visual reasoning abilities in general chart comprehension on
public benchmarks, leading to significant performance gains and enabling MLLMs
to rationally understand the charts. The code and dataset will be publicly
available upon publication.

### [4] [Predicting Failures of LLMs to Link Biomedical Ontology Terms to Identifiers Evidence Across Models and Ontologies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04458)
*Daniel B. Hier,Steven Keith Platt,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with ontology term-to-identifier linking; identifier exposure is the strongest predictor of success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but fail to accurately link ontology terms to their correct identifiers, requiring investigation into why these failures occur.

Method: Analyzed predictions across Human Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology using GPT-4o and LLaMa 3.1 405B models. Evaluated nine features related to term familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure through univariate and multivariate analyses.

Result: Exposure to ontology identifiers was identified as the strongest predictor of linking success.

Conclusion: The study reveals that familiarity with ontology identifiers through training data exposure is crucial for accurate term-to-identifier linking in biomedical NLP tasks.

Abstract: Large language models often perform well on biomedical NLP tasks but may fail
to link ontology terms to their correct identifiers. We investigate why these
failures occur by analyzing predictions across two major ontologies, Human
Phenotype Ontology and Gene Ontology, and two high-performing models, GPT-4o
and LLaMa 3.1 405B. We evaluate nine candidate features related to term
familiarity, identifier usage, morphology, and ontology structure. Univariate
and multivariate analyses show that exposure to ontology identifiers is the
strongest predictor of linking success.

### [5] [Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System of Large and Small Models for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04459)
*Shiqin Han,Manning Gao,Menghua Jiang,Yuncheng Jiang,Haifeng Hu,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS) that combines a powerful MLLM with a lightweight model for multimodal sentiment analysis, using uncertainty-driven cascade to reduce computational costs while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have high computational demands that limit real-world deployment, while smaller models are efficient but sacrifice performance. The paper aims to reconcile this performance-efficiency trade-off.

Method: Proposes U-ACS with uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism: lightweight model acts as rapid filter, only uncertain samples escalate to MLLM. Includes weighted averaging for similar polarity predictions and prompt-based cross-verification for conflicting predictions.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance while requiring only a fraction of computational resources compared to standalone MLLM.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully achieves dynamic computational resource allocation, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining MLLM-level accuracy for multimodal sentiment analysis.

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly
advanced the state-of-the-art in multimodal machine learning, yet their
substantial computational demands present a critical barrier to real-world
deployment. Conversely, smaller, specialized models offer high efficiency but
often at the cost of performance. To reconcile this performance-efficiency
trade-off, we propose a novel Uncertainty-Aware Collaborative System (U-ACS)
that synergistically orchestrates a powerful MLLM (e.g., HumanOmni) and a
lightweight baseline model for multimodal sentiment analysis. The core of our
system is an uncertainty-driven cascade mechanism, where the efficient small
model first acts as a rapid filter for all input samples. Only those samples
yielding high predictive uncertainty, thereby indicating greater difficulty,
are selectively escalated to the MLLM for more sophisticated analysis.
Furthermore, our system introduces advanced strategies to handle ambiguous or
conflicting predictions, including weighted averaging for predictions of
similar polarity and a prompt-based cross-verification to resolve conflicting
predictions when both models exhibit high uncertainty. This
sample-difficulty-aware approach allows for a dynamic allocation of
computational resources, drastically reducing inference costs while retaining
the high accuracy of MLLM. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources compared to
using a standalone MLLM.

### [6] [CoCoNUTS: Concentrating on Content while Neglecting Uninformative Textual Styles for AI-Generated Peer Review Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04460)
*Yihan Chen,Jiawei Chen,Guozhao Mo,Xuanang Chen,Ben He,Xianpei Han,Le Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes CoCoNUTS benchmark and CoCoDet detector for content-based AI-generated peer review detection, moving beyond style-based approaches to ensure fair and reliable scholarly evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address risks of LLM integration in peer review - existing AI detectors rely on stylistic cues and fail to distinguish between permissible language refinement vs substantive content generation, leading to unfair suspicion and missed deceptive AI reviews.

Method: Develop CoCoNUTS benchmark with fine-grained dataset covering 6 human-AI collaboration modes, and create CoCoDet detector using multi-task learning framework for content-based detection.

Result: Provides a practical foundation for evaluating LLM use in peer review and enables more accurate, robust detection of AI involvement in review content.

Conclusion: Shifts paradigm from style-based to content-based detection, contributing to more precise, equitable and reliable methods for real-world scholarly applications.

Abstract: The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review
process presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly
evaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language
refinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive
review content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to
paraphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language
refinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily
rely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result
in unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language
enhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.
To address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based
detection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark
built upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six
distinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an
AI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve
more accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our
work offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer
review, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and
reliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications. Our code and
data will be publicly available at https://github.com/Y1hanChen/COCONUTS.

### [7] [From Post To Personality: Harnessing LLMs for MBTI Prediction in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04461)
*Tian Ma,Kaiyu Feng,Yu Rong,Kangfei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PtoP is a novel LLM framework that uses Retrieval Augmented Generation and synthetic minority oversampling to predict MBTI personality types from social media posts, addressing LLM hallucination and class imbalance issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML/DL methods for MBTI prediction face challenges with LLM hallucination and imbalanced MBTI type distribution in the population, requiring a more robust solution.

Method: Proposes PostToPersonality (PtoP) framework that combines Retrieval Augmented Generation with in-context learning to reduce hallucination, and fine-tunes pretrained LLM with synthetic minority oversampling to handle class imbalance.

Result: Experiments on real-world social media data show PtoP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to 10 ML and DL baseline methods.

Conclusion: PtoP effectively addresses key challenges in LLM-based MBTI prediction and demonstrates superior performance, making it a valuable framework for personality analysis from social media content.

Abstract: Personality prediction from social media posts is a critical task that
implies diverse applications in psychology and sociology. The Myers Briggs Type
Indicator (MBTI), a popular personality inventory, has been traditionally
predicted by machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Recently,
the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revealed their huge potential
in understanding and inferring personality traits from social media content.
However, directly exploiting LLMs for MBTI prediction faces two key challenges:
the hallucination problem inherent in LLMs and the naturally imbalanced
distribution of MBTI types in the population. In this paper, we propose
PostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from
social media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval
Augmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in
LLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification
in MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the
class imbalance by generating synthetic samples. Experiments conducted on a
real world social media dataset demonstrate that PtoP achieves state of the art
performance compared with 10 ML and DL baselines.

### [8] [Benchmarking GPT-5 for biomedical natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04462)
*Yu Hou,Zaifu Zhan,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPT-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on biomedical NLP tasks, particularly excelling in question answering (94.1% on MedQA) while showing mixed results in extraction and summarization tasks compared to domain-specific models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of biomedical literature requires scalable NLP solutions, and while GPT-4 narrowed performance gaps with task-specific systems, its performance across different biomedical domains remained uneven, necessitating evaluation of newer models like GPT-5.

Method: Updated standardized BioNLP benchmark evaluating GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families using fixed prompt templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference.

Result: GPT-5 achieved strongest overall performance (0.557 macro-average under five-shot vs 0.506 for GPT-4), reached 94.1% accuracy on MedQA (exceeding previous SOTA by 50+ points), and showed major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), though summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.

Conclusion: GPT-5 offers deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches, with the benchmark providing guidance for BioNLP system design.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of biomedical literature has heightened the need for
scalable natural language processing (NLP) solutions. While GPT-4 substantially
narrowed the gap with task-specific systems, especially in question answering,
its performance across other domains remained uneven. We updated a standardized
BioNLP benchmark to evaluate GPT-5 and GPT-4o under zero-, one-, and five-shot
prompting across 12 datasets spanning six task families: named entity
recognition, relation extraction, multi-label document classification, question
answering, text summarization, and text simplification. Using fixed prompt
templates, identical decoding parameters, and batch inference, we report
primary metrics per dataset and include prior results for GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and
LLaMA-2-13B for comparison. GPT-5 achieved the strongest overall benchmark
performance, with macro-average scores rising to 0.557 under five-shot
prompting versus 0.506 for GPT-4 and 0.508 for GPT-4o. On MedQA, GPT-5 reached
94.1% accuracy, exceeding the previous supervised state of the art by over
fifty points, and attained parity with supervised systems on PubMedQA (0.734).
In extraction tasks, GPT-5 delivered major gains in chemical NER (0.886 F1) and
ChemProt relation extraction (0.616 F1), outperforming GPT-4 and GPT-4o, though
summarization and disease NER still lagged behind domain-specific baselines.
These results establish GPT-5 as a general-purpose model now offering
deployment-ready performance for reasoning-oriented biomedical QA, while
precision-critical extraction and evidence-dense summarization continue to
favor fine-tuned or hybrid approaches. The benchmark delineates where simple
prompting suffices and where retrieval-augmented or planning-based scaffolds
are likely required, providing actionable guidance for BioNLP system design as
frontier models advance.

### [9] [Can Multiple Responses from an LLM Reveal the Sources of Its Uncertainty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04464)
*Yang Nan,Pengfei He,Ravi Tandon,Han Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs produce unreliable outputs but uncertainty source diagnosis is understudied. This paper uses disagreement patterns among multiple LLM responses to diagnose uncertainty sources (ambiguity vs knowledge gaps) via an auxiliary LLM analyzer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often produce unreliable outputs, but current research focuses more on quantifying uncertainty rather than diagnosing its underlying causes, which is crucial for improving LLM reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Collect multiple responses from a target LLM and use an auxiliary LLM to analyze patterns of disagreement among them to identify uncertainty sources (input ambiguity, knowledge gaps, or both), including identifying specific missing facts in knowledge gap cases.

Result: The framework was validated on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro datasets, demonstrating its generality in diagnosing different uncertainty sources across various domains and question types.

Conclusion: Diagnosing the source of uncertainty through response disagreement patterns enables targeted manual interventions that can significantly improve LLM performance and reliability in practical applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have delivered significant breakthroughs across
diverse domains but can still produce unreliable or misleading outputs, posing
critical challenges for real-world applications. While many recent studies
focus on quantifying model uncertainty, relatively little work has been devoted
to \textit{diagnosing the source of uncertainty}. In this study, we show that,
when an LLM is uncertain, the patterns of disagreement among its multiple
generated responses contain rich clues about the underlying cause of
uncertainty. To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a
target LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of
disagreement. The auxiliary model is tasked to reason about the likely source
of uncertainty, such as whether it stems from ambiguity in the input question,
a lack of relevant knowledge, or both. In cases involving knowledge gaps, the
auxiliary model also identifies the specific missing facts or concepts
contributing to the uncertainty. In our experiment, we validate our framework
on AmbigQA, OpenBookQA, and MMLU-Pro, confirming its generality in diagnosing
distinct uncertainty sources. Such diagnosis shows the potential for relevant
manual interventions that improve LLM performance and reliability.

### [10] [Emotionally-Aware Agents for Dispute Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04465)
*Sushrita Rakshit,James Hale,Kushal Chawla,Jeanne M. Brett,Jonathan Gratch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how emotional expressions influence conflict outcomes in dispute resolution using automatic text emotion recognition on buyer-seller dialogues, finding that LLMs outperform previous methods and provide insights for managing emotional escalation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how emotional expressions shape conflict outcomes in disputes, which involve stronger emotions and different social processes than negotiations previously studied.

Method: Used a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues and applied automatic text emotion recognition, comparing large language models against previous emotion intensity annotation methods.

Result: LLMs showed considerably greater explanatory power than previous methods and better matched human annotator decisions. Emotional expressions were found to significantly influence both subjective and objective outcomes in disputes.

Conclusion: Findings support existing theoretical models of emotional influence in conflict and suggest agent-based systems could be useful for recognizing and mitigating emotional escalation in dispute management.

Abstract: In conflict, people use emotional expressions to shape their counterparts'
thoughts, feelings, and actions. This paper explores whether automatic text
emotion recognition offers insight into this influence in the context of
dispute resolution. Prior work has shown the promise of such methods in
negotiations; however, disputes evoke stronger emotions and different social
processes. We use a large corpus of buyer-seller dispute dialogues to
investigate how emotional expressions shape subjective and objective outcomes.
We further demonstrate that large-language models yield considerably greater
explanatory power than previous methods for emotion intensity annotation and
better match the decisions of human annotators. Findings support existing
theoretical models for how emotional expressions contribute to conflict
escalation and resolution and suggest that agent-based systems could be useful
in managing disputes by recognizing and potentially mitigating emotional
escalation.

### [11] [Just-in-time and distributed task representations in language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04466)
*Yuxuan Li,Declan Campbell,Stephanie C. Y. Chan,Andrew Kyle Lampinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models form transferable task representations in non-monotonic, sporadic ways during in-context learning, with strong temporal and semantic locality - emerging only at specific tokens and capturing minimal task scopes rather than full composite tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand when and how language models form representations for new tasks during in-context learning, specifically investigating transferable task representations that can restore task context without the full prompt.

Method: Focus on analyzing 'transferable' task representations - vector representations that can restore task context in another model instance without the complete prompt, examining how these evolve throughout the context sequence.

Result: Task representations evolve non-monotonically and sporadically, condensing multiple evidence pieces. They show strong locality along sequence dimension (emerging only at certain tokens) and capture minimal 'task scopes' rather than full composite tasks.

Conclusion: Language models use a just-in-time computational process with two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) to adapt to new evidence and learn tasks on the fly, relying on distributed representations for longer composite tasks.

Abstract: Many of language models' impressive capabilities originate from their
in-context learning: based on instructions or examples, they can infer and
perform new tasks without weight updates. In this work, we investigate
\emph{when} representations for new tasks are formed in language models, and
\emph{how} these representations change over the course of context. We focus on
''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can
restore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full
prompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic
ways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task
categories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often
condense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which
align well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the
context. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the
sequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task
identity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local
but transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',
such as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more
temporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.
This two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of
just-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt
to new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.

### [12] [Enhancing LLM Efficiency: Targeted Pruning for Prefill-Decode Disaggregation in Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04467)
*Hao Zhang,Mengsi Lyu,Yulong Ao,Yonghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel pruning method for LLMs that addresses prefill-decode disaggregation, enabling more efficient block pruning and KV cache management to reduce computational and memory costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face high computational and memory costs in deployment. Existing pruning methods ignore the practical characteristics of prefill-decode disaggregation, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Method: Proposes iterative block removal for prefill and decode stages separately using pruning and distillation sets. Introduces token-aware cache pruning that retains all KV Cache in prefill but selectively reuses entries for first and last token sequences in decode layers.

Result: Achieves 20.56% inference speedup and 4.95x reduction in data transmission bandwidth consumption. Consistently strong performance in both PD disaggregation and unified settings.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses PD disaggregation characteristics, providing significant efficiency improvements for LLM deployment without compromising performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across
various tasks, but their deployment is constrained by high computational and
memory costs. Model pruning provides an effective means to alleviate these
demands. However, existing methods often ignore the characteristics of
prefill-decode (PD) disaggregation in practice. In this paper, we propose a
novel pruning method for PD disaggregation inference, enabling more precise and
efficient block and KV Cache pruning. Our approach constructs pruning and
distillation sets to perform iterative block removal independently for the
prefill and decode stages, obtaining better pruning solutions. Moreover, we
introduce a token-aware cache pruning mechanism that retains all KV Cache in
the prefill stage but selectively reuses entries for the first and last token
sequences in selected layers during decode, reducing communication costs with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently achieves strong performance in both PD disaggregation and PD
unified settings without disaggregation. Under the default settings, our method
achieves a 20.56% inference speedup and a 4.95 times reduction in data
transmission bandwidth consumption.

Conclusion: Findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in finance, offering evidence-based guidance for model selection and cost-performance optimization in professional financial applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models presents significant
opportunities for financial applications, yet systematic evaluation in
specialized financial contexts remains limited. This study presents the first
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs using 1,560 multiple-choice
questions from official mock exams across Levels I-III of CFA, most rigorous
professional certifications globally that mirror real-world financial analysis
complexity. We compare models distinguished by core design priorities:
multi-modal and computationally powerful, reasoning-specialized and highly
accurate, and lightweight efficiency-optimized.
  We assess models under zero-shot prompting and through a novel
Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that integrates official CFA curriculum
content. The RAG system achieves precise domain-specific knowledge retrieval
through hierarchical knowledge organization and structured query generation,
significantly enhancing reasoning accuracy in professional financial
certification evaluation.
  Results reveal that reasoning-oriented models consistently outperform others
in zero-shot settings, while the RAG pipeline provides substantial improvements
particularly for complex scenarios. Comprehensive error analysis identifies
knowledge gaps as the primary failure mode, with minimal impact from text
readability. These findings provide actionable insights for LLM deployment in
finance, offering practitioners evidence-based guidance for model selection and

TL;DR: Benchmark of 8 multi-modal LLMs from GPT-5, Gemini 2.5, and Gemma 3 families on invoice document datasets, comparing direct image processing vs markdown conversion approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of different multi-modal large language models on document processing tasks, specifically invoice analysis, to guide selection of appropriate models and strategies for automated document systems.

Method: Zero-shot prompting of eight models across three families on three diverse invoice datasets, comparing two processing strategies: direct image processing using multi-modal capabilities and structured parsing approach converting documents to markdown first.

Result: Native image processing generally outperforms structured approaches, with performance varying across model types and document characteristics.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides valuable insights for selecting appropriate multi-modal models and processing strategies for automated document processing systems, with direct image processing showing superior performance overall.

Abstract: This paper benchmarks eight multi-modal large language models from three
families (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5, and open-source Gemma 3) on three diverse openly
available invoice document datasets using zero-shot prompting. We compare two
processing strategies: direct image processing using multi-modal capabilities
and a structured parsing approach converting documents to markdown first.

Conclusion: COCORELI provides an effective hybrid framework that addresses key limitations of LLMs through abstraction mechanisms and discourse processing, enabling better performance in complex collaborative tasks with reduced hallucination.

Abstract: We present COCORELI, a hybrid agent framework designed to tackle the
limitations of large language models (LLMs) in tasks requiring: following
complex instructions, minimizing hallucination, and spatial reasoning. COCORELI
integrates medium-sized LLM agents with novel abstraction mechanisms and a
discourse module to parse instructions to in-context learn dynamic, high-level
representations of the environment. Experiments on natural collaborative
construction tasks show that COCORELI outperforms single-LLM CoT and agentic
LLM systems, all using larger LLMs. It manages to largely avoid hallucinations,
identify missing information, ask for clarifications, and update its learned
objects. COCORELI's abstraction abilities extend beyond ENVIRONMENT, as shown
in the ToolBench API completion task.

*Alice Schiavone,Marco Fraccaro,Lea Marie Pehrson,Silvia Ingala,Rasmus Bonnevie,Michael Bachmann Nielsen,Vincent Beliveau,Melanie Ganz,Desmond Elliott*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MOSAIC is a multilingual radiology report classification system using compact open-access language models that achieves expert-level performance with minimal computational resources and small annotated datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for radiology report classification face limitations including linguistic variability challenges, dependency on large annotated datasets, reliance on closed-source/resource-intensive models, and restriction to English/single-modality datasets.

Method: Built on MedGemma-4B compact open-access language model, supporting zero-/few-shot prompting and lightweight fine-tuning. Evaluated across 7 datasets in 4 languages (English, Spanish, French, Danish) spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies.

Result: Achieves mean macro F1 score of 88 across 5 chest X-ray datasets (approaching/exceeding expert-level performance) using only 24GB GPU memory. With data augmentation, only 80 annotated samples needed for 82 weighted F1 score on Danish reports vs 86 with full 1600-sample set.

Conclusion: MOSAIC provides practical alternative to large/proprietary LLMs for clinical use, offering multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, computationally efficient solution. Open-source code and models available for community evaluation and extension.

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train
imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing
approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with
linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and
recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models
that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely
restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We
introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally
efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact
open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot
prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade
GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and
Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model
achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets,
approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB
of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are
sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86
with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative
to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are
open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new
languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

*Kushan Mitra,Dan Zhang,Hannah Kim,Estevam Hruschka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RECAP benchmark evaluates intent rewriting for better agent planning in ambiguous dialogues, showing LLM-based approaches outperform traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world dialogues are often ambiguous and underspecified, making intent detection challenging for conversational assistants using multiple agents. Traditional classification approaches struggle in open-ended settings.

Method: Proposed RECAP benchmark with dataset capturing ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal conversations. Developed prompt-based rewriting approach and fine-tuned two DPO-based rewriters.

Result: LLM-based prompt rewriting outperformed baselines. Fine-tuned DPO-based rewriters yielded additional utility gains in planning effectiveness.

Conclusion: Intent rewriting is a critical and tractable component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems, with RECAP providing an effective evaluation framework.

Abstract: Understanding user intent is essential for effective planning in
conversational assistants, particularly those powered by large language models
(LLMs) coordinating multiple agents. However, real-world dialogues are often
ambiguous, underspecified, or dynamic, making intent detection a persistent
challenge. Traditional classification-based approaches struggle to generalize
in open-ended settings, leading to brittle interpretations and poor downstream
planning. We propose RECAP (REwriting Conversations for Agent Planning), a new
benchmark designed to evaluate and advance intent rewriting, reframing
user-agent dialogues into concise representations of user goals. RECAP captures
diverse challenges such as ambiguity, intent drift, vagueness, and mixed-goal
conversations. Alongside the dataset, we introduce an LLM-based evaluator that
assesses planning utility given the rewritten intent. Using RECAP, we develop a
prompt-based rewriting approach that outperforms baselines. We further
demonstrate that fine-tuning two DPO-based rewriters yields additional utility
gains. Our results highlight intent rewriting as a critical and tractable
component for improving agent planning in open-domain dialogue systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Parameter-efficient adapter that converts speech embeddings to LLM tokens, achieving significant performance gains with 7x fewer parameters across ASR, NER, and sentiment analysis tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Integration of speech encoders with LLMs requires substantial data and resources, but real-world use cases face limitations due to insufficient data availability.

Method: Proposes a parameter-efficient adapter to convert speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, employs LLM-based synthetic dataset annotation to reduce labeling costs, and uses techniques like classifier regularizer and LoRA optimization.

Result: Achieves 26% relative WER improvement on ASR, 6.3% relative F1 increase on NER, 32% relative F1 boost on sentiment analysis, and 6.6-9.5% SLUE score improvement with advanced techniques.

Conclusion: The proposed adapter provides an efficient solution for speech-LLM integration with significantly reduced parameter requirements and substantial performance gains across multiple speech understanding tasks.

Abstract: While integrating speech encoder with LLM requires substantial data and
resources, use cases face limitations due to insufficient availability. To
address this, we propose a solution with a parameter-efficient adapter that
converts speech embeddings into LLM-compatible tokens, focusing on end-to-end
automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and
sentiment analysis (SA). To reduce labeling costs, we employ an LLM-based
synthetic dataset annotation technique. The proposed adapter, using 7x fewer
trainable parameters, achieves significant performance gains: a 26% relative
Word Error Rates (WER) improvement on the LibriSpeech ASR task, a 6.3% relative
F1 score increase on the NER task, and a 32% relative F1 score boost on the SA
task. Moreover, using advanced techniques such as adding a classifier
regularizer and optimizing the LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields
notable performance gains, with Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE)
score improvement of 6.6% and 9.5%

*Shengyin Sun,Yiming Li,Xing Li,Yingzhao Lian,Weizhe Lin,Hui-Ling Zhen,Zhiyuan Yang,Chen Chen,Xianzhi Yu,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark for evaluating speculative decoding methods to accelerate LLM test-time scaling, showing n-gram methods effectively capture repetitive patterns in reasoning traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling enhances LLM reasoning but generates redundant computational overhead through repetitive reasoning traces. Speculative decoding could mitigate this inefficiency but lacks proper evaluation in this context.

Method: Created a comprehensive benchmark with consistent protocols across test-time scaling paradigms (Best-of-N sampling, multi-round thinking) to evaluate three speculative decoding categories: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.

Result: N-gram-based methods effectively capture repetitive patterns and show unique potential in accelerating test-time scaling. Integration with other methods can balance acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables fair comparison and reveals the value of combining n-gram methods with other approaches to optimize test-time scaling efficiency, spurring further research in speculative decoding for LLM reasoning acceleration.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by allocating additional
computational resources during inference. However, this paradigm is inherently
inefficient due to the generation of redundant and repetitive reasoning traces,
leading to significant computational overhead. Speculative decoding offers a
promising avenue for mitigating this inefficiency, yet its efficacy in the
structured, repetition-rich context of test-time scaling remains largely
unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate speculative decoding methods for accelerating LLM
test-time scaling. Our benchmark provides consistent experimental protocols
across representative test-time scaling paradigms (e.g., Best-of-N sampling and
multi-round thinking), enabling a fair comparison of three major categories of
speculative decoding: model-based, training-based, and n-gram-based methods.
Extensive experiments reveal that simple n-gram-based methods effectively
capture repetitive patterns, demonstrating unique potential in accelerating
test-time scaling. This phenomenon demonstrates the value of integrating
n-gram-based methods with model-based or training-based approaches to balance
acceleration for both repetitive and diverse reasoning in test-time scaling. We
hope this benchmark spurs further research on speculative decoding for
test-time scaling, enabling faster and more practical reasoning in LLMs through
better handling of repetitive and diverse reasoning paths.

### [20] [ParaThinker: Native Parallel Thinking as a New Paradigm to Scale LLM Test-time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04475)
*Hao Wen,Yifan Su,Feifei Zhang,Yunxin Liu,Yunhao Liu,Ya-Qin Zhang,Yuanchun Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ParaThinker introduces parallel thought generation to overcome the Tunnel Vision bottleneck in sequential LLM reasoning, achieving significant accuracy improvements with minimal latency overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling strategies face diminishing returns as computation increases due to Tunnel Vision - where imperfect initial steps lock models into suboptimal reasoning paths, limiting their true potential.

Method: ParaThinker is an end-to-end framework that trains LLMs to generate multiple diverse reasoning paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer, enabling parallel compute scaling instead of sequential depth scaling.

Result: Substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5% for 7B models with 8 parallel paths) with only 7.1% latency overhead, allowing smaller models to surpass larger counterparts.

Conclusion: Parallel thinking is a critical and efficient dimension for scaling future LLMs, demonstrating that width scaling (parallel computation) is more effective than depth scaling (sequential computation) for superior reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been driven by test-time
compute scaling - a strategy that improves reasoning by generating longer,
sequential thought processes. While effective, this approach encounters a
significant bottleneck as computation increases, where further computation
offers only marginal performance gains. We argue this ceiling is not an
inherent limit of the model's capability but a flaw in the scaling strategy
itself, a phenomenon we term "Tunnel Vision", where a model's imperfect initial
steps lock it into a suboptimal reasoning path. To overcome this, we introduce
a new scaling paradigm: native thought parallelism. We present ParaThinker, an
end-to-end framework that trains an LLM to generate multiple, diverse reasoning
paths in parallel and synthesize them into a superior final answer. By
exploring different lines of thoughts simultaneously, ParaThinker effectively
sidesteps the Tunnel Vision issue and unlocks the model's latent reasoning
potential. Our approach demonstrates that scaling compute in parallel (width)
is a more effective and efficient way to superior reasoning than simply scaling
sequentially (depth). On challenging reasoning benchmarks, ParaThinker achieves
substantial accuracy improvements over sequential LLMs (12.3% for 1.5B and 7.5%
for 7B models on average with 8 parallel paths), while adding only negligible
latency overhead (7.1%). This enables smaller models to surpass much larger
counterparts and establishes parallel thinking as a critical, efficient
dimension for scaling future LLMs.

*Seojin Kim,Hyeontae Song,Jaehyun Nam,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CAMT5 introduces substructure-level tokenization and importance-based training to improve text-to-molecule generation, outperforming SOTA methods with only 2% of training tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-molecule models use atom-level tokenization that focuses on local connectivity but fails to capture global structural context like ring systems, limiting molecular understanding.

Method: Proposes Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5) with substructure-level tokenization and importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures to better capture molecular semantics.

Result: Extensive experiments show CAMT5's superiority in text-to-molecule generation tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods using only 2% of training tokens. Also proposes effective ensemble strategy to further boost performance.

Conclusion: Substructure-level tokenization and importance-based training enable more efficient and effective text-to-molecule generation by better capturing global molecular context and semantics.

Abstract: Recently, text-to-molecule models have shown great potential across various
chemical applications, e.g., drug-discovery. These models adapt language models
to molecular data by representing molecules as sequences of atoms. However,
they rely on atom-level tokenizations, which primarily focus on modeling local
connectivity, thereby limiting the ability of models to capture the global
structural context within molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
text-to-molecule model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by
the significance of the substructure-level contexts in understanding molecule
structures, e.g., ring systems, we introduce substructure-level tokenization
for text-to-molecule models. Building on our tokenization scheme, we develop an
importance-based training strategy that prioritizes key substructures, enabling
CAMT5 to better capture the molecular semantics. Extensive experiments verify
the superiority of CAMT5 in various text-to-molecule generation tasks.
Intriguingly, we find that CAMT5 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods using
only 2% of training tokens. In addition, we propose a simple yet effective
ensemble strategy that aggregates the outputs of text-to-molecule models to
further boost the generation performance. Code is available at

Method: Complete system architecture with automatic trip detection, on-device behavior analysis, two-step reflection NLG pipeline, and specialized ML model for alcohol detection, engineered for intermittent connectivity and noisy sensor data.

Result: Pilot deployment with 90 drivers demonstrated system viability, with initial results on detected unsafe behaviors presented.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for applying data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good in challenging environments.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end mobile system that delivers
culturally-attuned safe driving feedback to drivers in Nigeria, a low-resource
environment with significant infrastructural challenges. The core of the system
is a novel dual-component Natural Language Generation (NLG) engine that
provides both legally-grounded safety tips and persuasive, theory-driven
behavioural reports. We describe the complete system architecture, including an
automatic trip detection service, on-device behaviour analysis, and a
sophisticated NLG pipeline that leverages a two-step reflection process to
ensure high-quality feedback. The system also integrates a specialized machine
learning model for detecting alcohol-influenced driving, a key local safety
issue. The architecture is engineered for robustness against intermittent
connectivity and noisy sensor data. A pilot deployment with 90 drivers
demonstrates the viability of our approach, and initial results on detected
unsafe behaviours are presented. This work provides a framework for applying
data-to-text and AI systems to achieve social good.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rare token prediction in LLMs relies on distributed plateau neurons rather than modular clusters, with no preferential attention routing, showing training-driven differentiation enables adaptive capacity allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, and prior work identified specialized plateau neurons but their functional organization remains unclear.

Method: Neuron influence analyses, graph-based clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models.

Result: Rare token processing requires additional plateau neurons beyond common token processing, forming dual computational regimes; plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather than modular; attention shows no preferential routing to specialists.

Conclusion: Rare token specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation rather than architectural modularity, preserving context flexibility while enabling adaptive capacity allocation.

Abstract: Large language models struggle with rare token prediction, yet the mechanisms
driving their specialization remain unclear. Prior work identified specialized
``plateau'' neurons for rare tokens following distinctive three-regime
influence patterns \cite{liu2025emergent}, but their functional organization is
unknown. We investigate this through neuron influence analyses, graph-based
clustering, and attention head ablations in GPT-2 XL and Pythia models. Our
findings show that: (1) rare token processing requires additional plateau
neurons beyond the power-law regime sufficient for common tokens, forming dual
computational regimes; (2) plateau neurons are spatially distributed rather
than forming modular clusters; and (3) attention mechanisms exhibit no
preferential routing to specialists. These results demonstrate that rare token
specialization arises through distributed, training-driven differentiation
rather than architectural modularity, preserving context-sensitive flexibility
while achieving adaptive capacity allocation.

*Ryo Takahashi,Naoki Saito,Keisuke Maeda,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes discrete prompt tuning method to adapt multimodal LLMs for personalized visual emotion recognition, addressing bias towards majority viewpoints in standard MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs favor majority opinions and familiar patterns due to training on general datasets, limiting their performance in personalized VER which is crucial for real-world applications.

Method: Employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by human prompt engineering to select the best natural language representation from generated prompts and update prompts for accurate personalized VER.

Result: The method enables adaptation of MLLMs to individual users for personalized emotion recognition, overcoming the majority bias limitation.

Conclusion: Discrete prompt tuning effectively addresses the personalization challenge in VER tasks, making MLLMs more suitable for practical real-world applications requiring individual-level emotion recognition.

Abstract: Visual Emotion Recognition (VER) is an important research topic due to its
wide range of applications, including opinion mining and advertisement design.
Extending this capability to recognize emotions at the individual level further
broadens its potential applications. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention and demonstrated performance
comparable to that of conventional VER methods. However, MLLMs are trained on
large and diverse datasets containing general opinions, which causes them to
favor majority viewpoints and familiar patterns. This tendency limits their
performance in a personalized VER, which is crucial for practical and
real-world applications, and indicates a key area for improvement. To address
this limitation, the proposed method employs discrete prompt tuning inspired by
the process of humans' prompt engineering to adapt the VER task to each
individual. Our method selects the best natural language representation from
the generated prompts and uses it to update the prompt for the realization of
accurate personalized VER.

*Ravi Shankar,Sheng Wong,Lin Li,Magdalena Bachmann,Alex Silverthorne,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Energy-based model outperforms softmax and kNN methods for reliable abstention in RAG systems, especially on hard semantic cases in safety-critical domains like women's health.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation systems in safety-critical domains where incorrect answers can cause harm, particularly in women's health applications.

Method: Developed an energy-based model that learns a smooth energy landscape over 2.6M guideline-derived questions, benchmarked against calibrated softmax baseline and kNN density heuristic across easy and hard abstention splits.

Result: EBM achieved superior performance on hard cases (AUROC 0.961 vs 0.950 for softmax) and reduced FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). Comparable performance on easy negatives but significant advantage in safety-critical hard distributions.

Conclusion: Energy-based abstention scoring provides more reliable confidence than probability-based softmax, offering scalable and interpretable foundation for safe RAG systems, with robustness primarily from energy scoring head rather than specific negative sampling strategies.

Abstract: Reliable abstention is critical for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, particularly in safety-critical domains such as women's health, where
incorrect answers can lead to harm. We present an energy-based model (EBM) that
learns a smooth energy landscape over a dense semantic corpus of 2.6M
guideline-derived questions, enabling the system to decide when to generate or
abstain. We benchmark the EBM against a calibrated softmax baseline and a
k-nearest neighbour (kNN) density heuristic across both easy and hard
abstention splits, where hard cases are semantically challenging
near-distribution queries. The EBM achieves superior abstention performance
abstention on semantically hard cases, reaching AUROC 0.961 versus 0.950 for
softmax, while also reducing FPR@95 (0.235 vs 0.331). On easy negatives,
performance is comparable across methods, but the EBM's advantage becomes most
pronounced in safety-critical hard distributions. A comprehensive ablation with
controlled negative sampling and fair data exposure shows that robustness stems
primarily from the energy scoring head, while the inclusion or exclusion of
specific negative types (hard, easy, mixed) sharpens decision boundaries but is
not essential for generalisation to hard cases. These results demonstrate that
energy-based abstention scoring offers a more reliable confidence signal than
probability-based softmax confidence, providing a scalable and interpretable
foundation for safe RAG systems.

TL;DR: DecMetrics introduces three new metrics (COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS, SEMANTIC ENTROPY) to automatically evaluate claim decomposition quality and uses them to optimize a lightweight decomposition model for fact-checking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current research focuses on generative methods for claim decomposition but lacks proper evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of decomposed atomic claims, creating a gap in reliable fact-checking systems.

Method: Developed three automated metrics (COMPLETENESS, CORRECTNESS, SEMANTIC ENTROPY) to assess decomposition quality, then integrated these metrics as a reward function to optimize a lightweight claim decomposition model.

Result: The approach provides automated evaluation benchmarks for claim decomposition, enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of fact-checking systems through optimized decomposition quality.

Conclusion: DecMetrics bridges the evaluation gap in claim decomposition research by providing automated quality assessment metrics that can be used to optimize decomposition models and improve fact-checking system performance.

Abstract: Claim decomposition plays a crucial role in the fact-checking process by
breaking down complex claims into simpler atomic components and identifying
their unfactual elements. Despite its importance, current research primarily
focuses on generative methods for decomposition, with insufficient emphasis on
evaluating the quality of these decomposed atomic claims. To bridge this gap,
we introduce \textbf{DecMetrics}, which comprises three new metrics:
\texttt{COMPLETENESS}, \texttt{CORRECTNESS}, and \texttt{SEMANTIC ENTROPY},
designed to automatically assess the quality of claims produced by
decomposition models. Utilizing these metrics, we develop a lightweight claim
decomposition model, optimizing its performance through the integration of
these metrics as a reward function. Through automatic evaluation, our approach
aims to set a benchmark for claim decomposition, enhancing both the reliability
and effectiveness of fact-checking systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces RevUtil dataset for evaluating review comment quality and shows fine-tuned models can match GPT-4o performance in assessing review utility aspects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With reviewers having less time, automated systems are needed to ensure high-quality peer review feedback that is useful for authors.

Method: Created RevUtil dataset with 1,430 human-labeled and 10k synthetically labeled review comments with rationales, then benchmarked fine-tuned models on four utility aspects.

Result: Fine-tuned models achieved human agreement levels comparable to or exceeding GPT-4o, but machine-generated reviews generally underperform human reviews on the four aspects.

Conclusion: The RevUtil dataset enables effective evaluation of review comment utility, and fine-tuned models can assess review quality at levels competitive with powerful closed models.

Abstract: Providing constructive feedback to paper authors is a core component of peer
review. With reviewers increasingly having less time to perform reviews,
automated support systems are required to ensure high reviewing quality, thus
making the feedback in reviews useful for authors. To this end, we identify
four key aspects of review comments (individual points in weakness sections of
reviews) that drive the utility for authors: Actionability, Grounding &
Specificity, Verifiability, and Helpfulness. To enable evaluation and
development of models assessing review comments, we introduce the RevUtil
dataset. We collect 1,430 human-labeled review comments and scale our data with
10k synthetically labeled comments for training purposes. The synthetic data
additionally contains rationales, i.e., explanations for the aspect score of a
review comment. Employing the RevUtil dataset, we benchmark fine-tuned models
for assessing review comments on these aspects and generating rationales. Our
experiments demonstrate that these fine-tuned models achieve agreement levels
with humans comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, those of powerful
closed models like GPT-4o. Our analysis further reveals that machine-generated
reviews generally underperform human reviews on our four aspects.

Conclusion: Phenotype-based tokenization enables clinically interpretable predictions with computational efficiency, demonstrating effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

Abstract: We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for
cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records
(EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme
that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens,
achieving 99.6\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic
information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442
tokens - a 77.9\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We
pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a
masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction
of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major
adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause
mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set
with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all
outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842,
all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically
interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining
for EHR-based risk prediction tasks.

TL;DR: Proposes serialized output prompts (SOP) to enhance LLM-based multi-talker ASR systems, improving performance in complex scenarios like three-speaker conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based multi-talker ASR systems either omit prompts or use simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring prompt design to enhance performance.

Method: Extracts serialized output prompts (SOP) using Separator and serialized CTC layers after speech encoder, then uses SOP as prompts for LLMs. Employs three-stage training: SOT fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based adaptation.

Result: Experimental results on LibriMix dataset show SOP approach significantly improves performance under both two- and three-talker conditions, addressing limitations of standard SOT models in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed SOP method effectively enhances LLM-based multi-talker ASR systems by providing structured prompts, demonstrating substantial performance gains especially in challenging multi-speaker environments.

Abstract: Prompts are crucial for task definition and for improving the performance of
large language models (LLM)-based systems. However, existing LLM-based
multi-talker (MT) automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems either omit
prompts or rely on simple task-definition prompts, with no prior work exploring
the design of prompts to enhance performance. In this paper, we propose
extracting serialized output prompts (SOP) and explicitly guiding the LLM using
structured prompts to improve system performance (SOP-MT-ASR). A Separator and
serialized Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) layers are inserted
after the speech encoder to separate and extract MT content from the mixed
speech encoding in a first-speaking-first-out manner. Subsequently, the SOP,
which serves as a prompt for LLMs, is obtained by decoding the serialized CTC
outputs using greedy search. To train the model effectively, we design a
three-stage training strategy, consisting of serialized output training (SOT)
fine-tuning, serialized speech information extraction, and SOP-based
adaptation. Experimental results on the LibriMix dataset show that, although
the LLM-based SOT model performs well in the two-talker scenario, it fails to
fully leverage LLMs under more complex conditions, such as the three-talker
scenario. The proposed SOP approach significantly improved performance under
both two- and three-talker conditions.

*Xinnian Zhao,Hugo Van Hamme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using TV subtitles as context prompts rather than direct supervision in weakly supervised ASR, with weighted attention mechanism to handle audio-text discrepancies and generate improved pseudo transcripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TV subtitles are widely available but poorly aligned with audio, making them unsuitable as direct supervision for verbatim transcription in ASR systems.

Method: Reimagines subtitles as context-rich prompts instead of direct supervision, uses generated pseudo transcripts as primary targets with iterative refinement, and introduces weighted attention mechanism to emphasize relevant subtitle tokens.

Result: Significant improvements in transcription accuracy, producing enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets that serve as high-quality foundational resources for ASR training.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively leverages TV subtitles as contextual guidance rather than direct supervision, enabling better handling of audio-text discrepancies and generating superior training data for robust ASR systems.

Abstract: This study proposes a novel approach to using TV subtitles within a weakly
supervised (WS) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) framework. Although TV
subtitles are readily available, their imprecise alignment with corresponding
audio limits their applicability as supervised targets for verbatim
transcription. Rather than using subtitles as direct supervision signals, our
method reimagines them as context-rich prompts. This design enables the model
to handle discrepancies between spoken audio and subtitle text. Instead,
generated pseudo transcripts become the primary targets, with subtitles acting
as guiding cues for iterative refinement. To further enhance the process, we
introduce a weighted attention mechanism that emphasizes relevant subtitle
tokens during inference. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements
in transcription accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed
method in refining transcripts. These enhanced pseudo-labeled datasets provide
high-quality foundational resources for training robust ASR systems.

*Charles Moslonka,Hicham Randrianarivo,Arthur Garnier,Emmanuel Malherbe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: One-shot hallucination detection method using limited log-probability data from black-box LLM APIs to improve QA reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLM outputs for QA tasks undermine real-world reliability, especially in API-constrained scenarios with limited data access.

Method: Derives uncertainty indicators from available top candidate log-probabilities during non-greedy decoding, using Entropy Production Rate (EPR) metric and supervised learning with entropic contributions of top-ranked tokens.

Result: Significantly improves hallucination detection over EPR alone across diverse QA datasets and multiple LLMs, using only small sets of available log-probabilities (e.g., top <10 per token).

Conclusion: Provides a readily deployable technique to enhance LLM trustworthiness in QA and RAG systems from a single generation pass, demonstrated effective in finance framework applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs for Question Answering
(QA) tasks critically undermine their real-world reliability. This paper
introduces an applied methodology for robust, one-shot hallucination detection,
specifically designed for scenarios with limited data access, such as
interacting with black-box LLM APIs that typically expose only a few top
candidate log-probabilities per token. Our approach derives uncertainty
indicators directly from these readily available log-probabilities generated
during non-greedy decoding. We first derive an Entropy Production Rate (EPR)
metric that offers baseline performance, later augmented with supervised
learning. Our learned model uses features representing the entropic
contributions of the accessible top-ranked tokens within a single generated
sequence, requiring no multiple query re-runs. Evaluated across diverse QA
datasets and multiple LLMs, this estimator significantly improves hallucination
detection over using EPR alone. Crucially, high performance is demonstrated
using only the typically small set of available log-probabilities (e.g., top
<10 per token), confirming its practical efficiency and suitability for these
API-constrained deployments. This work provides a readily deployable technique
to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM responses from a single generation pass
in QA and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, with its utility
further demonstrated in a finance framework analyzing responses to queries on
annual reports from an industrial dataset.

TL;DR: Analysis of ICU discharge summaries using hybrid NLP approach detects clinician burnout with high accuracy (F1=0.84), outperforming metadata-only methods and identifying high-risk specialties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinician burnout threatens patient safety in ICUs, but existing research relies on retrospective surveys or EHR metadata, missing valuable narrative insights from clinical notes.

Method: Hybrid pipeline combining BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for clinical narratives, lexical stress lexicon for burnout surveillance, and LDA topic modeling with workload proxies on 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from MIMIC-IV.

Result: Provider-level logistic regression classifier achieved precision=0.80, recall=0.89, F1=0.84, surpassing metadata-only baselines by ≥0.17 F1 score. Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology providers showed elevated burnout risk.

Conclusion: ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive well-being monitoring, demonstrating the value of NLP approaches for burnout detection beyond traditional methods.

Abstract: Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly
in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly
relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR)
metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in
clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from
MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health
records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses
diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses,
procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce
a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for
clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout
surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload
proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision
of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out
set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1
score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among
providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate
that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive
well-being monitoring.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show significant geographic, demographic, and economic biases in university recommendations, favoring Global North institutions and reinforcing gender stereotypes despite some diversity improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine and quantify biases in LLM-based educational recommendation systems that could perpetuate societal inequalities in higher education access.

Method: Used 360 simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status to analyze over 25,000 recommendations from three open-source LLMs (LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, Mistral-7B), proposing a novel multi-dimensional evaluation framework.

Result: Strong biases found: Global North institutions disproportionately favored, gender stereotypes reinforced, institutional repetition prevalent. LLaMA-3.1 showed highest diversity (481 unique universities across 58 countries) but systemic disparities persisted.

Conclusion: Urgent need for bias consideration in educational LLMs to ensure equitable global access to higher education, requiring multi-dimensional evaluation beyond just accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as daily recommendation
systems for tasks like education planning, yet their recommendations risk
perpetuating societal biases. This paper empirically examines geographic,
demographic, and economic biases in university and program suggestions from
three open-source LLMs: LLaMA-3.1-8B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B. Using 360
simulated user profiles varying by gender, nationality, and economic status, we
analyze over 25,000 recommendations. Results show strong biases: institutions
in the Global North are disproportionately favored, recommendations often
reinforce gender stereotypes, and institutional repetition is prevalent. While
LLaMA-3.1 achieves the highest diversity, recommending 481 unique universities
across 58 countries, systemic disparities persist. To quantify these issues, we
propose a novel, multi-dimensional evaluation framework that goes beyond
accuracy by measuring demographic and geographic representation. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for bias consideration in educational LMs to ensure
equitable global access to higher education.

TL;DR: DeepTRACE is an audit framework that evaluates generative search engines and research agents on 8 dimensions, finding they often produce overconfident, one-sided responses with poor citation accuracy and unsupported statements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak sourcing, and confusing citation practices in generative search engines and deep research LLM agents, necessitating a systematic evaluation framework.

Method: DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis with decomposition and confidence scoring, builds citation and factual-support matrices, and employs automated extraction pipelines for popular models with LLM-judge validation against human raters.

Result: Generative search engines produce one-sided, highly confident responses with large fractions of unsupported statements. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence but remain one-sided with citation accuracy ranging 40-80%.

Conclusion: Current generative search and research systems exhibit significant shortcomings in source attribution and balanced reasoning, highlighting the need for improved citation practices and evidence-based synthesis.

Abstract: Generative search engines and deep research LLM agents promise trustworthy,
source-grounded synthesis, yet users regularly encounter overconfidence, weak
sourcing, and confusing citation practices. We introduce DeepTRACE, a novel
sociotechnically grounded audit framework that turns prior community-identified
failure cases into eight measurable dimensions spanning answer text, sources,
and citations. DeepTRACE uses statement-level analysis (decomposition,
confidence scoring) and builds citation and factual-support matrices to audit
how systems reason with and attribute evidence end-to-end. Using automated
extraction pipelines for popular public models (e.g., GPT-4.5/5, You.com,
Perplexity, Copilot/Bing, Gemini) and an LLM-judge with validated agreement to
human raters, we evaluate both web-search engines and deep-research
configurations. Our findings show that generative search engines and deep
research agents frequently produce one-sided, highly confident responses on
debate queries and include large fractions of statements unsupported by their
own listed sources. Deep-research configurations reduce overconfidence and can
attain high citation thoroughness, but they remain highly one-sided on debate
queries and still exhibit large fractions of unsupported statements, with
citation accuracy ranging from 40--80% across systems.

*Rushi Wang,Jiateng Liu,Cheng Qian,Yifan Shen,Yanzhou Pan,Zhaozhuo Xu,Ahmed Abbasi,Heng Ji,Denghui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs are vulnerable to inappropriate content in mixed contexts, showing a counterintuitive tendency to prioritize less prevalent information. The paper introduces a neuroscience-inspired approach (RW-Steering) that enables models to identify and ignore harmful content through targeted fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world contexts often contain mixed relevant and inappropriate content, posing reliability risks to LLMs. Current methods lack robust generalization across varying proportions of harmful content, requiring extensive supervision.

Method: Introduced Poisoned Context Testbed with real-world mixed contexts. Adapted Rescorla-Wagner model from neuroscience to quantify contextual influence. Developed RW-Steering, a two-stage fine-tuning approach that teaches models to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.

Result: LLMs exhibit strong tendency to incorporate less prevalent (often inappropriate) content. RW-Steering improved response quality by 39.8% and reversed the undesirable behavior curve. The method generalizes robustly across varying proportions of inappropriate content.

Conclusion: RW-Steering provides a robust, generalizable context engineering solution that significantly improves LLM safety in real-world applications by enabling models to internally filter inappropriate content without extensive supervision.

Abstract: Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.

TL;DR: A comprehensive tutorial-style paper that provides clear, step-by-step explanations of key instruction tuning algorithms (SFT, Rejection Sampling, REINFORCE, TRPO, PPO, GRPO, DPO) specifically for LLMs, with simplified notation and reduced cognitive overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanations of instruction tuning algorithms often assume prior knowledge, lack critical details, or are overly complex and generalized, making them difficult for newcomers to understand.

Method: Develops each algorithm step by step using simplified and explicit notation focused specifically on LLMs, minimizing detours into broader RL literature and eliminating superfluous abstractions.

Result: Provides clear and intuitive understanding of instruction tuning concepts, followed by a literature review of newer techniques and presentation of new research ideas (GRAPE).

Conclusion: The paper successfully demystifies complex instruction tuning algorithms through simplified, LLM-focused explanations, making them more accessible while also contributing new research directions in the field.

Abstract: This paper provides a self-contained, from-scratch, exposition of key
algorithms for instruction tuning of models: SFT, Rejection Sampling,
REINFORCE, Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO), Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO). Explanations of these algorithms often assume
prior knowledge, lack critical details, and/or are overly generalized and
complex. Here, each method is discussed and developed step by step using
simplified and explicit notation focused on LLMs, aiming to eliminate ambiguity
and provide a clear and intuitive understanding of the concepts. By minimizing
detours into the broader RL literature and connecting concepts to LLMs, we
eliminate superfluous abstractions and reduce cognitive overhead. Following
this exposition, we provide a literature review of new techniques and
approaches beyond those detailed. Finally, new ideas for research and
exploration in the form of GRAPE (Generalized Relative Advantage Policy
Evolution) are presented.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VaccineRAG is a Chain-of-Thought-based RAG dataset that addresses retrieval precision issues by evaluating models with varying positive/negative sample ratios and enhancing sample discrimination through explicit CoT analysis, with Partial-GRPO improving complex sequence learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG effectiveness is hindered by poor retrieval precision where irrelevant/misleading samples create bottlenecks for LLM performance, requiring better sample discrimination capabilities.

Method: VaccineRAG benchmark with varying sample ratios, explicit Chain-of-Thought analysis prompting, and Partial-GRPO that models LLM outputs as multiple components for better complex sequence learning.

Result: Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in enhancing models' sample-discrimination and complex CoT learning capabilities.

Conclusion: VaccineRAG successfully addresses RAG retrieval precision limitations through systematic evaluation and enhanced CoT-based analysis, with Partial-GRPO improving complex sequence learning for better performance.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances the response accuracy of Large
Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval and generation modules with
external knowledge, demonstrating particular strength in real-time queries and
Visual Question Answering tasks. However, the effectiveness of RAG is
frequently hindered by the precision of the retriever: many retrieved samples
fed into the generation phase are irrelevant or misleading, posing a critical
bottleneck to LLMs' performance. To address this challenge, we introduce
VaccineRAG, a novel Chain-of-Thought-based retrieval-augmented generation
dataset. On one hand, VaccineRAG employs a benchmark to evaluate models using
data with varying positive/negative sample ratios, systematically exposing
inherent weaknesses in current LLMs. On the other hand, it enhances models'
sample-discrimination capabilities by prompting LLMs to generate explicit
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) analysis for each sample before producing final answers.
Furthermore, to enhance the model's ability to learn long-sequence complex CoT
content, we propose Partial-GRPO. By modeling the outputs of LLMs as multiple
components rather than a single whole, our model can make more informed
preference selections for complex sequences, thereby enhancing its capacity to
learn complex CoT. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies on VaccineRAG
validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The code and dataset will be
publicly released soon.

TL;DR: Behavioral Fingerprinting framework analyzes LLMs' cognitive and interactive styles beyond traditional performance metrics, revealing that while reasoning capabilities converge, alignment behaviors vary significantly across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks focus on performance metrics but fail to capture nuanced behavioral characteristics that differentiate LLMs, necessitating a more comprehensive evaluation approach.

Method: Uses a Diagnostic Prompt Suite and automated evaluation pipeline with a powerful LLM as impartial judge to analyze 18 models across capability tiers, creating multi-faceted behavioral profiles.

Result: Reveals critical divergence: core capabilities like abstract/causal reasoning converge among top models, but alignment behaviors (sycophancy, semantic robustness) vary dramatically. Documents cross-model default persona clustering (ISTJ/ESTJ) reflecting common alignment incentives.

Conclusion: A model's interactive nature is not emergent from scale or reasoning power but a direct consequence of specific, highly variable developer alignment strategies. The framework provides reproducible methodology for uncovering deep behavioral differences.

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) primarily focus on
performance metrics, often failing to capture the nuanced behavioral
characteristics that differentiate them. This paper introduces a novel
``Behavioral Fingerprinting'' framework designed to move beyond traditional
evaluation by creating a multi-faceted profile of a model's intrinsic cognitive
and interactive styles. Using a curated \textit{Diagnostic Prompt Suite} and an
innovative, automated evaluation pipeline where a powerful LLM acts as an
impartial judge, we analyze eighteen models across capability tiers. Our
results reveal a critical divergence in the LLM landscape: while core
capabilities like abstract and causal reasoning are converging among top
models, alignment-related behaviors such as sycophancy and semantic robustness
vary dramatically. We further document a cross-model default persona clustering
(ISTJ/ESTJ) that likely reflects common alignment incentives. Taken together,
this suggests that a model's interactive nature is not an emergent property of
its scale or reasoning power, but a direct consequence of specific, and highly
variable, developer alignment strategies. Our framework provides a reproducible
and scalable methodology for uncovering these deep behavioral differences.

TL;DR: Enhanced ASR framework combining transformer acoustic model with LLM post-processing for silent speech interfaces, achieving 16% relative WER reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Silent speech interfaces generate speech with phonetic ambiguity and noise, requiring improved recognition and downstream processing capabilities.

Method: Transformer-based acoustic model captures full utterance context combined with large language model (LLM) for post-processing to ensure linguistic consistency.

Result: 16% relative and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline, showing substantial intelligibility improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses phonetic ambiguity and noise in silent speech interfaces through context-aware acoustic modeling and LLM-based linguistic refinement.

Abstract: Silent Speech Interfaces (SSIs) have gained attention for their ability to
generate intelligible speech from non-acoustic signals. While significant
progress has been made in advancing speech generation pipelines, limited work
has addressed the recognition and downstream processing of synthesized speech,
which often suffers from phonetic ambiguity and noise. To overcome these
challenges, we propose an enhanced automatic speech recognition framework that
combines a transformer-based acoustic model with a large language model (LLM)
for post-processing. The transformer captures full utterance context, while the
LLM ensures linguistic consistency. Experimental results show a 16% relative
and 6% absolute reduction in word error rate (WER) over a 36% baseline,
demonstrating substantial improvements in intelligibility for silent speech
interfaces.

TL;DR: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) can outperform single large language model (LLM) systems in complex problem-solving when using progressive sub-task training, achieving better effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare single agent LLM systems vs multi-agent SLM systems for complex problems, examining both effectiveness and efficiency trade-offs, and address limitations of SLMs in long-trajectory learning.

Method: Instantiated single and multi-agent systems in AppWorld environment using different sized models. Introduced progressive sub-task training strategy that introduces new sub-tasks progressively each epoch, similar to curriculum learning.

Result: Progressive training strategy consistently improved multi-agent effectiveness across all configurations. Fine-tuned multi-agent systems achieved better effectiveness-efficiency Pareto trade-offs. The strategy significantly reduced subtask error rates.

Conclusion: Multi-agent SLM systems with progressive sub-task training provide a viable alternative to single LLM systems, offering superior efficiency-effectiveness balance for complex problem-solving tasks.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems with smaller language models (SLMs) present a viable
alternative to single agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) for
addressing complex problems. In this work, we study how these alternatives
compare in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. To study this trade-off,
we instantiate single and multi-agent systems for the complex problems in the
AppWorld environment using different sized language models.
  We find that difficulties with long-trajectory learning in smaller language
models (SLMs) limit their performance. Even when trained for specialized roles,
SLMs fail to learn all subtasks effectively. To address this issue, we
introduce a simple progressive sub-task training strategy, which introduces new
sub-tasks progressively in each training epoch. We find that this novel
strategy, analogous to instance level curriculum learning, consistently
improves the effectiveness of multi-agents at all configurations. Our Pareto
analysis shows that fine-tuned multi-agent systems yield better
effectiveness-efficiency trade-offs. Additional ablations and analyses shows
the importance of our progressive training strategy and its ability to reduce
subtask error rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether VR-derived data from reading tests and self-esteem assessments combined with machine learning can effectively differentiate between students with and without dyslexia.

Method: Participants completed VR-based silent reading tasks and self-esteem assessments. Statistical analysis (t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests) compared scores between groups, followed by supervised machine learning models trained on the data.

Result: Significant differences found in completion time but not accuracy or self-esteem. ML models achieved 87.5% accuracy for Italian, 66.6% for Spanish, and 75.0% for pooled group classification.

Conclusion: VR and ML can be effective supporting tools for dyslexia assessment, particularly capturing differences in task completion speed, though language-specific factors affect classification accuracy.

Abstract: This study explores the use of virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) to predict the presence of dyslexia in Italian and Spanish
university students. In particular, the research investigates whether
VR-derived data from Silent Reading (SR) tests and self-esteem assessments can
differentiate between students that are affected by dyslexia and students that
are not, employing machine learning (ML) algorithms. Participants completed
VR-based tasks measuring reading performance and self-esteem. A preliminary
statistical analysis (t tests and Mann Whitney tests) on these data was
performed, to compare the obtained scores between individuals with and without
dyslexia, revealing significant differences in completion time for the SR test,
but not in accuracy, nor in self esteem. Then, supervised ML models were
trained and tested, demonstrating an ability to classify the presence/absence
of dyslexia with an accuracy of 87.5 per cent for Italian, 66.6 per cent for
Spanish, and 75.0 per cent for the pooled group. These findings suggest that VR
and ML can effectively be used as supporting tools for assessing dyslexia,
particularly by capturing differences in task completion speed, but
language-specific factors may influence classification accuracy.

TL;DR: Smaller LLMs with lightweight fine-tuning can achieve comparable performance to larger models in emotional safety classification tasks, enabling privacy-preserving on-device applications for mental health contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how LLMs process emotionally sensitive content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in mental health applications where privacy and safety are paramount.

Method: Constructed a novel dataset by merging human-authored mental health datasets (>15K samples) with ChatGPT-generated emotion re-interpretation prompts. Evaluated four LLaMA models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings on trinary classification and multi-label classification tasks.

Result: Larger LLMs achieved stronger average performance, especially in nuanced multi-label classification and zero-shot settings. However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance comparable to larger models and BERT in high-data categories while requiring <2GB VRAM at inference.

Conclusion: Smaller, on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and maintain safe conversational boundaries, with implications for therapeutic LLM applications and scalable safety alignment.

Abstract: Understanding how large language models (LLMs) process emotionally sensitive
content is critical for building safe and reliable systems, particularly in
mental health contexts. We investigate the scaling behavior of LLMs on two key
tasks: trinary classification of emotional safety (safe vs. unsafe vs.
borderline) and multi-label classification using a six-category safety risk
taxonomy. To support this, we construct a novel dataset by merging several
human-authored mental health datasets (> 15K samples) and augmenting them with
emotion re-interpretation prompts generated via ChatGPT. We evaluate four LLaMA
models (1B, 3B, 8B, 70B) across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings.
Our results show that larger LLMs achieve stronger average performance,
particularly in nuanced multi-label classification and in zero-shot settings.
However, lightweight fine-tuning allowed the 1B model to achieve performance
comparable to larger models and BERT in several high-data categories, while
requiring <2GB VRAM at inference. These findings suggest that smaller,
on-device models can serve as viable, privacy-preserving alternatives for
sensitive applications, offering the ability to interpret emotional context and
maintain safe conversational boundaries. This work highlights key implications
for therapeutic LLM applications and the scalable alignment of safety-critical
systems.

Motivation: Language models propagate social biases in their outputs, particularly in gender and ethnicity representation within occupational stories, which perpetuates harmful stereotypes from training data.

Method: Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME) leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt engineering. The approach analyzes stories across 25 occupational groups using three LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, GPT-4 Turbo) and multiple demographic dimensions.

Result: The method revealed persistent patterns of overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes. BAME achieved improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20% across different scenarios.

Conclusion: Guiding models with their own internal reasoning mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, contributing to more transparent generative AI systems without requiring model parameter modifications.

Abstract: Language models have been shown to propagate social bias through their
output, particularly in the representation of gender and ethnicity. This paper
investigates gender and ethnicity biases in AI-generated occupational stories.
Representation biases are measured before and after applying our proposed
mitigation strategy, Bias Analysis and Mitigation through Explanation (BAME),
revealing improvements in demographic representation ranging from 2% to 20%.
BAME leverages model-generated explanations to inform targeted prompt
engineering, effectively reducing biases without modifying model parameters. By
analyzing stories generated across 25 occupational groups, three large language
models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and GPT-4 Turbo), and
multiple demographic dimensions, we identify persistent patterns of
overrepresentation and underrepresentation linked to training data stereotypes.
Our findings demonstrate that guiding models with their own internal reasoning
mechanisms can significantly enhance demographic parity, thereby contributing
to the development of more transparent generative AI systems.

### [44] [Artificially Fluent: Swahili AI Performance Benchmarks Between English-Trained and Natively-Trained Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04516)
*Sophie Jaffer,Simeon Sayer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Native Swahili-trained BERT model outperformed English model with translated Swahili inputs (0.36% vs 1.47% error rate), showing translation alone doesn't bridge language representation gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether data disparities in multilingual LLMs disadvantage non-English speakers and examine if translation can compensate for language representation differences.

Method: Compared two monolingual BERT models: one trained/tested on Swahili data, another on English data. Translated Swahili news to English and evaluated on English model to simulate multilingual LLM processing.

Result: Native Swahili model performed significantly better with nearly 4x fewer errors (0.36% vs 1.47%) despite high-quality translation, indicating translation doesn't fully bridge language representation gaps.

Conclusion: Native-language training remains crucial for reliable outcomes. Future research should focus on developing datasets for underrepresented languages and improving multilingual model evaluation to reduce digital divides.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) expand multilingual capabilities, questions
remain about the equity of their performance across languages. While many
communities stand to benefit from AI systems, the dominance of English in
training data risks disadvantaging non-English speakers. To test the hypothesis
that such data disparities may affect model performance, this study compares
two monolingual BERT models: one trained and tested entirely on Swahili data,
and another on comparable English news data. To simulate how multilingual LLMs
process non-English queries through internal translation and abstraction, we
translated the Swahili news data into English and evaluated it using the
English-trained model. This approach tests the hypothesis by evaluating whether
translating Swahili inputs for evaluation on an English model yields better or
worse performance compared to training and testing a model entirely in Swahili,
thus isolating the effect of language consistency versus cross-lingual
abstraction. The results prove that, despite high-quality translation, the
native Swahili-trained model performed better than the Swahili-to-English
translated model, producing nearly four times fewer errors: 0.36% vs. 1.47%
respectively. This gap suggests that translation alone does not bridge
representational differences between languages and that models trained in one
language may struggle to accurately interpret translated inputs due to
imperfect internal knowledge representation, suggesting that native-language
training remains important for reliable outcomes. In educational and
informational contexts, even small performance gaps may compound inequality.
Future research should focus on addressing broader dataset development for
underrepresented languages and renewed attention to multilingual model
evaluation, ensuring the reinforcing effect of global AI deployment on existing
digital divides is reduced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate emotional aspects and sentiment patterns in patient experiences following mesh implantation surgeries, particularly focusing on identifying urgent concern reports and understanding how patient experiences relate to medical device regulation changes and healthcare advancements.

Method: Used Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NRC Emotion Lexicon and TextBlob sentiment analysis on MAUDE database patient reports from 2000-2021, categorizing narratives into eight emotions and assessing sentiment polarity.

Result: Detected increased Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during 2011-2012 and 2017-2018 periods, revealing temporal patterns in patient sentiment and emotional responses.

Conclusion: Emotional considerations are crucial in medical practices, and sentiment analysis can significantly enhance preoperative counseling, postoperative care, and patient preparation for mesh implant surgeries.

Abstract: Mesh implants are widely utilized in hernia repair surgeries, but
postoperative complications present a significant concern. This study analyzes
patient reports from the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience
(MAUDE) database spanning 2000 to 2021 to investigate the emotional aspects of
patients following mesh implantation using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Employing the National Research Council Canada (NRC) Emotion Lexicon and
TextBlob for sentiment analysis, the research categorizes patient narratives
into eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy,
and disgust) and assesses sentiment polarity. The goal is to discern patterns
in patient sentiment over time and to identify reports signaling urgent
concerns, referred to as "Concern Reports," thereby understanding shifts in
patient experiences in relation to changes in medical device regulation and
technological advancements in healthcare. The study detected an increase in
Concern Reports and higher emotional intensity during the periods of 2011-2012
and 2017-2018. Through temporal analysis of Concern Reports and overall
sentiment, this research provides valuable insights for healthcare
practitioners, enhancing their understanding of patient experiences
post-surgery, which is critical for improving preoperative counselling,
postoperative care, and preparing patients for mesh implant surgeries. The
study underscores the importance of emotional considerations in medical
practices and the potential for sentiment analysis to inform and enhance
patient care.

*Dhruvi Paprunia,Vansh Kharidia,Pankti Doshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) to improve tool-use capabilities in Small Language Models, making them more efficient and practical for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small Language Models struggle with tool use compared to Large Language Models due to limited training data and contextual understanding, creating a need for more efficient solutions.

Method: Employed Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance tool-use proficiency in SLMs, providing an efficient alternative to conventional fine-tuning.

Result: Significantly boosted SLM tool-use accuracy, increasing their practical utility for real-world applications without heavy computation requirements.

Conclusion: The RL-based approach using GRPO effectively addresses SLM limitations in tool use, offering an efficient and adaptable solution that enhances their functionality for complex tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have progressed beyond simple text creation, and
tool use has become increasingly important for complex, real-world tasks. Tool
use in LLMs refers to their ability to utilize external resources such as APIs,
databases, or software functions to extend their functionality beyond
generating text.Tools are used for tasks such as performing calculations,
making API calls to retrieve the current time and date, and more. This
capability enables models to fetch real-time data, execute commands, or solve
problems requiring dynamic interaction, making it indispensable for
applications like AI agents in virtual assistants, robotic control, or
automated workflows.
  However, while LLMs are usually adept tool use, their vast resource
requirements and computation complexity restrict their use in every use case.As
a result, there is an increasing need for more compact and efficient Small
Language Models (SLMs). Small language models (SLMs) struggle in tool use
compared to large language models (LLMs). As soon in Table 1. SLMs are
typically trained on smaller, more specific datasets, resulting in a narrower
knowledge base and limited contextual understanding compared to LLMs.
  This research addresses these challenges by using Reinforcement Learning
(RL), specifically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to enhance
tool-use proficiency in SLMs. Unlike conventional fine-tuning approaches that
require heavy computation and often lack adaptability, our method provides an
efficient, effective solution that significantly boosts SLM tool-use accuracy,
increasing their practical utility.

TL;DR: HSMP-BERT is a prompt-based model for extracting structured clinical information from Hebrew radiology reports for Crohn's disease, achieving superior performance over baselines and enabling population-level analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is challenging, especially for low-resource languages like Hebrew and complex conditions like Crohn's disease with multi-organ findings.

Method: Developed Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based model trained on 512 radiologist-annotated Hebrew radiology reports with 90 structured labels per subject, using multilabel-stratified split and hierarchical inference.

Result: HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1 0.83±0.08 and κ 0.65±0.17, significantly outperforming baseline models (SMP zero-shot and standard fine-tuning) with p < 10^{-7}. Hierarchical inference reduced runtime 5.1×.

Conclusion: HSMP-BERT provides a scalable solution for structured extraction in radiology, enabling population-level Crohn's disease analysis and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource language settings.

Abstract: Extracting structured clinical information from radiology reports is
challenging, especially in low-resource languages. This is pronounced in
Crohn's disease, with sparsely represented multi-organ findings. We developed
Hierarchical Structured Matching Prediction BERT (HSMP-BERT), a prompt-based
model for extraction from Hebrew radiology text. In an administrative database
study, we analyzed 9,683 reports from Crohn's patients imaged 2010-2023 across
Israeli providers. A subset of 512 reports was radiologist-annotated for
findings across six gastrointestinal organs and 15 pathologies, yielding 90
structured labels per subject. Multilabel-stratified split (66%
train+validation; 33% test), preserving label prevalence. Performance was
evaluated with accuracy, F1, Cohen's $\kappa$, AUC, PPV, NPV, and recall. On 24
organ-finding combinations with $>$15 positives, HSMP-BERT achieved mean F1
0.83$\pm$0.08 and $\kappa$ 0.65$\pm$0.17, outperforming the SMP zero-shot
baseline (F1 0.49$\pm$0.07, $\kappa$ 0.06$\pm$0.07) and standard fine-tuning
(F1 0.30$\pm$0.27, $\kappa$ 0.27$\pm$0.34; paired t-test $p < 10^{-7}$).
Hierarchical inference cuts runtime 5.1$\times$ vs. traditional inference.
Applied to all reports, it revealed associations among ileal wall thickening,
stenosis, and pre-stenotic dilatation, plus age- and sex-specific trends in
inflammatory findings. HSMP-BERT offers a scalable solution for structured
extraction in radiology, enabling population-level analysis of Crohn's disease
and demonstrating AI's potential in low-resource settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using GPT to analyze 200,000+ Spanish newspaper articles about Colombian armed conflict to create historical memory and study violence-coca eradication relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Colombia lacks systematic documentation of decades of armed conflict, resulting in missing historical accounts and publicly available conflict information.

Method: Utilized GPT large language model to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related Spanish newspaper articles, then conducted descriptive analysis and studied violence-coca crop eradication relationships.

Result: Created a comprehensive dataset enabling policy analysis and demonstrated how LLMs can examine large text corpora at previously infeasible depth.

Conclusion: LLMs open new research opportunities by enabling deep analysis of large text collections, contributing to Colombia's historical memory and supporting policy analyses.

Abstract: Colombia has been submerged in decades of armed conflict, yet until recently,
the systematic documentation of violence was not a priority for the Colombian
government. This has resulted in a lack of publicly available conflict
information and, consequently, a lack of historical accounts. This study
contributes to Colombia's historical memory by utilizing GPT, a large language
model (LLM), to read and answer questions about over 200,000 violence-related
newspaper articles in Spanish. We use the resulting dataset to conduct both
descriptive analysis and a study of the relationship between violence and the
eradication of coca crops, offering an example of policy analyses that such
data can support. Our study demonstrates how LLMs have opened new research
opportunities by enabling examinations of large text corpora at a previously
infeasible depth.

Motivation: Large language models face adoption barriers in healthcare due to size, computational requirements, and data privacy concerns that preclude cloud deployment.

Method: Systematically evaluated quantization impact on 12 state-of-the-art LLMs across 8 benchmark datasets covering 4 key biomedical NLP tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label classification, and question answering.

Result: Quantization reduces GPU memory requirements by up to 75% while preserving model performance, enabling 70B-parameter models on 40GB consumer GPUs. Domain knowledge and prompt responsiveness are largely maintained.

Conclusion: Quantization is a practical and effective strategy for secure local deployment of large language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the gap between AI advances and clinical translation.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in biomedical
natural language processing, yet their rapid growth in size and computational
requirements present a major barrier to adoption in healthcare settings where
data privacy precludes cloud deployment and resources are limited. In this
study, we systematically evaluated the impact of quantization on 12
state-of-the-art large language models, including both general-purpose and
biomedical-specific models, across eight benchmark datasets covering four key
tasks: named entity recognition, relation extraction, multi-label
classification, and question answering. We show that quantization substantially
reduces GPU memory requirements-by up to 75%-while preserving model performance
across diverse tasks, enabling the deployment of 70B-parameter models on 40GB
consumer-grade GPUs. In addition, domain-specific knowledge and responsiveness
to advanced prompting methods are largely maintained. These findings provide
significant practical and guiding value, highlighting quantization as a
practical and effective strategy for enabling the secure, local deployment of
large yet high-capacity language models in biomedical contexts, bridging the
gap between technical advances in AI and real-world clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based language models excel in NLP tasks but lack fine-grained control, making it challenging to manipulate their behavior precisely for specific applications.

Method: The paper formalizes controllable text generation as an optimization problem and introduces methods including prompt engineering, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, model editing, and reinforcement learning. It proposes a unified framework with prompt-level steering, activation interventions, and weight-space edits.

*Xiyuan Gao,Shekhar Nayak,Matt Coler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic review on speech-based sarcasm recognition, covering evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches, datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm poses challenges in human-machine interactions, and while text-based detection has been studied, speech data's role in sarcasm recognition remains underexplored despite prosodic cues being crucial for conveying sarcastic intent.

Method: Systematic review analyzing datasets, feature extraction techniques (from traditional acoustic features to deep learning representations), and classification methods (from unimodal to multimodal fusion approaches).

Result: Identified limitations in datasets for speech sarcasm recognition, documented evolution of feature extraction and classification techniques, and highlighted gaps in cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition.

Conclusion: Sarcasm should be treated as a multimodal phenomenon rather than text-based challenge, with need for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual approaches in speech-based sarcasm recognition.

Abstract: Sarcasm, a common feature of human communication, poses challenges in
interpersonal interactions and human-machine interactions. Linguistic research
has highlighted the importance of prosodic cues, such as variations in pitch,
speaking rate, and intonation, in conveying sarcastic intent. Although previous
work has focused on text-based sarcasm detection, the role of speech data in
recognizing sarcasm has been underexplored. Recent advancements in speech
technology emphasize the growing importance of leveraging speech data for
automatic sarcasm recognition, which can enhance social interactions for
individuals with neurodegenerative conditions and improve machine understanding
of complex human language use, leading to more nuanced interactions. This
systematic review is the first to focus on speech-based sarcasm recognition,
charting the evolution from unimodal to multimodal approaches. It covers
datasets, feature extraction, and classification methods, and aims to bridge
gaps across diverse research domains. The findings include limitations in
datasets for sarcasm recognition in speech, the evolution of feature extraction
techniques from traditional acoustic features to deep learning-based
representations, and the progression of classification methods from unimodal
approaches to multimodal fusion techniques. In so doing, we identify the need
for greater emphasis on cross-cultural and multilingual sarcasm recognition, as
well as the importance of addressing sarcasm as a multimodal phenomenon, rather
than a text-based challenge.

*Osman Batur İnce,André F. T. Martins,Oisin Mac Aodha,Edoardo M. Ponti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEMI enables sample-efficient integration of new modalities into LLMs using a hypernetwork trained on high-resource modalities, achieving 64x data efficiency compared to training from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal foundation models struggle with integrating new modalities due to the large and evolving modality space and lack of paired data for low-resource modalities.

Method: Uses a hypernetwork that adapts a shared projector between modality encoders and LLMs, trained on high-resource modalities and conditioned on few samples from any modality at inference. Increases training diversity through isometric transformations.

Result: Achieves significant sample efficiency boost - 32-shot SEMI matches accuracy of training from scratch with 64x more data. Successfully integrated satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules.

Conclusion: SEMI promises to extend modality coverage of foundation models by enabling efficient integration of diverse modalities with minimal data requirements.

Abstract: Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since
the space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a
model from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,
integrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires
a significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for
low-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for
sample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).
To this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --
placed between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The
hypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,
video), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at
inference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of
training modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through
isometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in
sample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,
satellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)
with encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the
same accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs
64$\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality
coverage of foundation models.

Motivation: The proliferation of LLMs has created security vulnerabilities where adversarial actors can manipulate prompts to cause harm, circumvent safety alignments, and exploit model weaknesses for IP theft and misinformation.

Method: Comprehensive literature survey and systematic categorization of prompt-based attack methodologies to establish clear threat models and understand attack mechanisms.

Result: Provides a structured framework for understanding various prompt-based attack vectors and their impacts on LLM security and safety alignments.

Conclusion: Systematic understanding of prompt-based attacks is crucial for developing robust countermeasures and building next-generation LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized manipulation, distillation, and editing.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced critical
security challenges, where adversarial actors can manipulate input prompts to
cause significant harm and circumvent safety alignments. These prompt-based
attacks exploit vulnerabilities in a model's design, training, and contextual
understanding, leading to intellectual property theft, misinformation
generation, and erosion of user trust. A systematic understanding of these
attack vectors is the foundational step toward developing robust
countermeasures. This paper presents a comprehensive literature survey of
prompt-based attack methodologies, categorizing them to provide a clear threat
model. By detailing the mechanisms and impacts of these exploits, this survey
aims to inform the research community's efforts in building the next generation
of secure LLMs that are inherently resistant to unauthorized distillation,

*Sharif Noor Zisad,Ragib Hasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer models like BERT outperform traditional ML models for disaster tweet classification, achieving 91% accuracy vs 82% for Logistic Regression/Naive Bayes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media platforms provide real-time disaster information, but traditional ML models fail to understand context and informal language in tweets, limiting emergency response effectiveness.

Method: Evaluated transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) against traditional ML approaches (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) for classifying disaster-related tweets.

Result: BERT achieved highest accuracy at 91%, significantly outperforming traditional models (82% for Logistic Regression/Naive Bayes). Transformer models better understand subtle language through contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures are far more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy, deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real-world social media text.

Abstract: Twitter and other social media platforms have become vital sources of real
time information during disasters and public safety emergencies. Automatically
classifying disaster related tweets can help emergency services respond faster
and more effectively. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models such as Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines have been widely used for
this task, but they often fail to understand the context or deeper meaning of
words, especially when the language is informal, metaphorical, or ambiguous. We
posit that, in this context, transformer based models can perform better than
traditional ML models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of
transformer based models, including BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, for
classifying disaster related tweets. These models are compared with traditional
ML approaches to highlight the performance gap. Experimental results show that
BERT achieved the highest accuracy (91%), significantly outperforming
traditional models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes (both at 82%). The
use of contextual embeddings and attention mechanisms allows transformer models
to better understand subtle language in tweets, where traditional ML models
fall short. This research demonstrates that transformer architectures are far
more suitable for public safety applications, offering improved accuracy,
deeper language understanding, and better generalization across real world
social media text.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Novel OOD detection method for specialized LLMs using dropout tolerance within ICAD framework, achieving 2-37% AUROC improvement over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized LLMs produce unreliable outputs on out-of-domain inputs, posing risks in critical applications despite strong in-domain performance.

Method: Uses Inductive Conformal Anomaly Detection with a new non-conformity measure based on dropout tolerance, aggregated across layers via ensemble approach.

Result: Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show superior OOD detection with AUROC improvements of 2% to 37% compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Dropout tolerance-based approach effectively detects OOD inputs while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds, enhancing reliability of specialized LLMs.

Abstract: We propose a novel inference-time out-of-domain (OOD) detection algorithm for
specialized large language models (LLMs). Despite achieving state-of-the-art
performance on in-domain tasks through fine-tuning, specialized LLMs remain
vulnerable to incorrect or unreliable outputs when presented with OOD inputs,
posing risks in critical applications. Our method leverages the Inductive
Conformal Anomaly Detection (ICAD) framework, using a new non-conformity
measure based on the model's dropout tolerance. Motivated by recent findings on
polysemanticity and redundancy in LLMs, we hypothesize that in-domain inputs
exhibit higher dropout tolerance than OOD inputs. We aggregate dropout
tolerance across multiple layers via a valid ensemble approach, improving
detection while maintaining theoretical false alarm bounds from ICAD.
Experiments with medical-specialized LLMs show that our approach detects OOD
inputs better than baseline methods, with AUROC improvements of $2\%$ to $37\%$
when treating OOD datapoints as positives and in-domain test datapoints as
negatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First comprehensive evaluation of hallucination in Arabic and multilingual LLMs on Arabic question answering and summarization tasks, revealing Arabic-specific models outperform multilingual ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination research has focused mainly on English, leaving Arabic LLMs underexplored despite Arabic's widespread global use and importance in communication.

Method: Evaluated 12 LLMs (4 Arabic pre-trained, 4 multilingual, 4 reasoning-based) using a fine-grained framework with 12 hallucination indicators for factual consistency and faithfulness assessment.

Result: Factual hallucinations more prevalent than faithfulness errors; Arabic pre-trained model Allam showed lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and comparable performance to reasoning-based models.

Conclusion: Arabic-specific LLMs demonstrate superior performance in reducing hallucinations compared to multilingual models, highlighting the importance of language-specific training for Arabic NLP tasks.

Abstract: Recently, extensive research on the hallucination of the large language
models (LLMs) has mainly focused on the English language. Despite the growing
number of multilingual and Arabic-specific LLMs, evaluating LLMs' hallucination
in the Arabic context remains relatively underexplored. The knowledge gap is
particularly pressing given Arabic's widespread use across many regions and its
importance in global communication and media. This paper presents the first
comprehensive hallucination evaluation of Arabic and multilingual LLMs on two
critical Arabic natural language generation tasks: generative question
answering (GQA) and summarization. This study evaluates a total of 12 LLMs,
including 4 Arabic pre-trained models, 4 multilingual models, and 4
reasoning-based models. To assess the factual consistency and faithfulness of
LLMs' outputs, we developed a fine-grained hallucination evaluation framework
consisting of 12 fine-grained hallucination indicators that represent the
varying characteristics of each task. The results reveal that factual
hallucinations are more prevalent than faithfulness errors across all models
and tasks. Notably, the Arabic pre-trained model Allam consistently
demonstrates lower hallucination rates than multilingual models and a
comparative performance with reasoning-based models. The code is available at:

TL;DR: A novel schema-aligned paraphrasing framework using SQL-to-NL generation to create linguistically diverse but semantically equivalent queries for evaluating NL2SQL model robustness to linguistic variation, revealing significant performance drops in state-of-the-art models.


<details>

Motivation: Existing NL2SQL benchmarks fail to systematically evaluate model robustness to linguistic variation, which is crucial for understanding generalization capabilities in real-world applications where users express the same intent in different ways.

Method: Proposed a schema-aligned paraphrasing framework that leverages SQL-to-NL generation to automatically produce semantically equivalent but lexically diverse queries while maintaining schema and intent alignment, enabling isolated evaluation of linguistic variation effects.

Result: State-of-the-art models show significant brittleness: LLaMa3.3-70B drops 10.23% in execution accuracy (77.11% to 66.9%), LLaMa3.1-8B drops nearly 20% (62.9% to 42.5%), with smaller models disproportionately affected. Robustness degradation varies by query complexity, dataset, and domain.

Conclusion: NL2SQL models are far more brittle to linguistic variation than standard benchmarks suggest, highlighting the critical need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable real-world performance.

Abstract: Robust evaluation in the presence of linguistic variation is key to
understanding the generalization capabilities of Natural Language to SQL
(NL2SQL) models, yet existing benchmarks rarely address this factor in a
systematic or controlled manner. We propose a novel schema-aligned paraphrasing
framework that leverages SQL-to-NL (SQL2NL) to automatically generate
semantically equivalent, lexically diverse queries while maintaining alignment
with the original schema and intent. This enables the first targeted evaluation
of NL2SQL robustness to linguistic variation in isolation-distinct from prior
work that primarily investigates ambiguity or schema perturbations. Our
analysis reveals that state-of-the-art models are far more brittle than
standard benchmarks suggest. For example, LLaMa3.3-70B exhibits a 10.23% drop
in execution accuracy (from 77.11% to 66.9%) on paraphrased Spider queries,
while LLaMa3.1-8B suffers an even larger drop of nearly 20% (from 62.9% to
42.5%). Smaller models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) are disproportionately affected. We
also find that robustness degradation varies significantly with query
complexity, dataset, and domain -- highlighting the need for evaluation
frameworks that explicitly measure linguistic generalization to ensure reliable
performance in real-world settings.

### [58] [Why Language Models Hallucinate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664)
*Adam Tauman Kalai,Ofir Nachum,Santosh S. Vempala,Edwin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language models hallucinate because training and evaluation reward guessing over admitting uncertainty, and hallucinations originate from binary classification errors where incorrect statements can't be distinguished from facts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language models undermine trust and persist even in state-of-the-art systems, requiring analysis of their statistical causes and mitigation strategies.

Method: Analyzing the statistical causes of hallucinations in modern training pipelines, showing they originate from errors in binary classification and are reinforced by evaluation procedures that penalize uncertainty.

Result: Hallucinations are not mysterious but stem from natural statistical pressures where models are optimized to guess when uncertain to improve test performance on existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The epidemic of penalizing uncertain responses requires socio-technical mitigation by modifying scoring of existing benchmarks to steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems, rather than adding more hallucination evaluations.

Abstract: Like students facing hard exam questions, large language models sometimes
guess when uncertain, producing plausible yet incorrect statements instead of
admitting uncertainty. Such "hallucinations" persist even in state-of-the-art
systems and undermine trust. We argue that language models hallucinate because
the training and evaluation procedures reward guessing over acknowledging
uncertainty, and we analyze the statistical causes of hallucinations in the
modern training pipeline. Hallucinations need not be mysterious -- they
originate simply as errors in binary classification. If incorrect statements
cannot be distinguished from facts, then hallucinations in pretrained language
models will arise through natural statistical pressures. We then argue that
hallucinations persist due to the way most evaluations are graded -- language
models are optimized to be good test-takers, and guessing when uncertain
improves test performance. This "epidemic" of penalizing uncertain responses
can only be addressed through a socio-technical mitigation: modifying the
scoring of existing benchmarks that are misaligned but dominate leaderboards,
rather than introducing additional hallucination evaluations. This change may
steer the field toward more trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: ODKE+ is a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of open-domain facts from web sources with high precision (98.8%) using a scalable pipeline combining pattern-based rules and LLM-based extraction with ontological guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintaining knowledge graph freshness and completeness is costly, requiring automated systems that can extract high-quality facts from web sources at scale while ensuring precision.

Method: Combines modular components: Extraction Initiator, Evidence Retriever, hybrid Knowledge Extractors (pattern-based rules + ontology-guided LLM prompting), lightweight Grounder for validation, and Corroborator for ranking/normalization. Uses dynamically generated ontology snippets for type-consistent extraction.

Result: Processed over 9 million Wikipedia pages, ingested 19 million high-confidence facts with 98.8% precision. Achieved 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reduced update lag by 50 days on average.

Conclusion: LLM-based extraction grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows can deliver trustworthy, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad real-world applicability.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are foundational to many AI applications, but
maintaining their freshness and completeness remains costly. We present ODKE+,
a production-grade system that automatically extracts and ingests millions of
open-domain facts from web sources with high precision. ODKE+ combines modular
components into a scalable pipeline: (1) the Extraction Initiator detects
missing or stale facts, (2) the Evidence Retriever collects supporting
documents, (3) hybrid Knowledge Extractors apply both pattern-based rules and
ontology-guided prompting for large language models (LLMs), (4) a lightweight
Grounder validates extracted facts using a second LLM, and (5) the Corroborator
ranks and normalizes candidate facts for ingestion. ODKE+ dynamically generates
ontology snippets tailored to each entity type to align extractions with schema
constraints, enabling scalable, type-consistent fact extraction across 195
predicates. The system supports batch and streaming modes, processing over 9
million Wikipedia pages and ingesting 19 million high-confidence facts with
98.8% precision. ODKE+ significantly improves coverage over traditional
methods, achieving up to 48% overlap with third-party KGs and reducing update
lag by 50 days on average. Our deployment demonstrates that LLM-based
extraction, grounded in ontological structure and verification workflows, can
deliver trustworthiness, production-scale knowledge ingestion with broad
real-world applicability. A recording of the system demonstration is included
with the submission and is also available at https://youtu.be/UcnE3_GsTWs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KERAG is a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that retrieves broader subgraphs to improve question answering coverage, using retrieval-filtering-summarization with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KGQA methods suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and semantic ambiguity in semantic parsing approaches.

Method: Retrieval-filtering-summarization approach combined with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs to reduce noise.

Result: KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

Conclusion: The approach enhances QA coverage and improves performance for both simple and complex questions through broader knowledge retrieval and effective reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external data, with Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offering crucial information for question answering. Traditional
Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) methods rely on semantic parsing,
which typically retrieves knowledge strictly necessary for answer generation,
thus often suffer from low coverage due to rigid schema requirements and
semantic ambiguity. We present KERAG, a novel KG-based RAG pipeline that
enhances QA coverage by retrieving a broader subgraph likely to contain
relevant information. Our retrieval-filtering-summarization approach, combined
with fine-tuned LLMs for Chain-of-Thought reasoning on knowledge sub-graphs,
reduces noises and improves QA for both simple and complex questions.
Experiments demonstrate that KERAG surpasses state-of-the-art solutions by
about 7% in quality and exceeds GPT-4o (Tool) by 10-21%.

*Lee Kezar,Zed Sehyr,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes phonological inductive biases to improve vector-quantized autoencoders for sign language recognition, enhancing generalization to unseen signs through better representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language datasets often lack vocabulary representativeness, creating a need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector quantization shows promise but may learn spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance.

Method: The authors investigate two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement (architectural bias) and Phonological Semi-Supervision (regularization technique) with a vector-quantized autoencoder for isolated sign recognition.

Result: The learned representations from the proposed model are more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline.

Conclusion: Explicit, linguistically-motivated biases can significantly improve the generalization of learned representations for sign language, providing better performance on both known and unseen signs.

Abstract: Sign language datasets are often not representative in terms of vocabulary,
underscoring the need for models that generalize to unseen signs. Vector
quantization is a promising approach for learning discrete, token-like
representations, but it has not been evaluated whether the learned units
capture spurious correlations that hinder out-of-vocabulary performance. This
work investigates two phonological inductive biases: Parameter Disentanglement,
an architectural bias, and Phonological Semi-Supervision, a regularization
technique, to improve isolated sign recognition of known signs and
reconstruction quality of unseen signs with a vector-quantized autoencoder. The
primary finding is that the learned representations from the proposed model are
more effective for one-shot reconstruction of unseen signs and more
discriminative for sign identification compared to a controlled baseline. This
work provides a quantitative analysis of how explicit, linguistically-motivated
biases can improve the generalization of learned representations of sign
language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have revolutionized clinical NLP but their optimal use for patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration to develop robust and generalizable systems.

Method: Benchmarked various LLMs (BERT, GatorTron, GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1, GatorTronLlama) across five datasets, comparing full fine-tuning vs prompt-based PEFT, and evaluated multi-task instruction tuning using leave-one-dataset-out strategy for zero-shot and few-shot learning.

Result: The study provides comprehensive benchmarking results comparing different LLM architectures and fine-tuning approaches for clinical concept and relation extraction tasks.

Conclusion: The research identifies optimal strategies for using LLMs in clinical information extraction, contributing to more effective healthcare NLP applications through architecture selection, fine-tuning methods, and multi-task learning approaches.

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) is a key technology to extract important
patient information from clinical narratives to support healthcare
applications. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has
revolutionized many NLP tasks in the clinical domain, yet their optimal use in
patient information extraction tasks requires further exploration. This study
examines LLMs' effectiveness in patient information extraction, focusing on LLM
architectures, fine-tuning strategies, and multi-task instruction tuning
techniques for developing robust and generalizable patient information
extraction systems. This study aims to explore key concepts of using LLMs for
clinical concept and relation extraction tasks, including: (1) encoder-only or
decoder-only LLMs, (2) prompt-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
algorithms, and (3) multi-task instruction tuning on few-shot learning
performance. We benchmarked a suite of LLMs, including encoder-based LLMs
(BERT, GatorTron) and decoder-based LLMs (GatorTronGPT, Llama 3.1,
GatorTronLlama), across five datasets. We compared traditional full-size
fine-tuning and prompt-based PEFT. We explored a multi-task instruction tuning
framework that combines both tasks across four datasets to evaluate the
zero-shot and few-shot learning performance using the leave-one-dataset-out
strategy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-hop question decomposition method significantly improves LLM performance on complex questions, outperforming direct answering approach both before and after fine-tuning with LLAMA3 model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of accurately answering complex questions with Large Language Models by leveraging multi-hop decomposition within knowledge graphs.

Method: Used LLAMA3 model to investigate multi-hop question decomposition in MQUAKE framework. Converted MQUAKE-T dataset into single-hop and multi-hop formats, fine-tuned with LoRA, and conducted inference tests.

Result: Multi-hop decomposition significantly outperformed direct answering without fine-tuning. After LoRA fine-tuning, both methods improved but multi-hop maintained superiority.

Conclusion: Multi-hop question decomposition effectively enhances LLM's complex question answering capability both before and after training, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Accurately answering complex questions has consistently been a significant
challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, this paper
proposes a multi-hop question decomposition method for complex questions,
building upon research within the MQUAKE framework. Utilizing the LLAMA3 model,
we systematically investigate the impact of multi-hop question decomposition
within knowledge graphs on model comprehension and reasoning accuracy, both
before and after model training. In our experiments, we systematically
partitioned and converted the MQUAKE-T dataset into two distinct formats: a
single-hop dataset designed for directly answering complex questions, and a
multi-hop dataset constructed using the multi-hop question decomposition
method. We then fine-tuned the LLAMA3 model on these datasets and conducted
inference tests. Our results demonstrate that, without fine-tuning the LLM, the
prediction performance based on the multi-hop question decomposition method
significantly outperforms the method of directly answering complex questions.
After fine-tuning using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) method, the performance
of both approaches improved compared to the untrained baseline. Crucially, the
method utilizing multi-hop decomposition consistently maintained its
superiority. These findings validate the effectiveness of the multi-hop
decomposition method both before and after training, demonstrating its
capability to effectively enhance the LLM's ability to answer complex
questions.

TL;DR: GPT-4o fine-tuned for humor understanding performs nearly as well as RoBERTa (0.85 vs 0.86 F1-macro), challenging whether LLMs truly understand nuanced language like humor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether large language models truly understand nuanced language concepts like humor, building on Turing's vision of human-like machine communication and addressing the open question of computer humor comprehension.

Method: Fine-tuned GPT-4o (decoder model) and compared its performance against fine-tuned RoBERTa (encoder model) on humor understanding tasks using F1-macro scores.

Result: GPT-4o achieved a Mean F1-macro score of 0.85, performing nearly as well as the best fine-tuned encoder model RoBERTa which scored 0.86.

Conclusion: Modern decoder models like GPT-4o can approach encoder model performance on nuanced language tasks like humor understanding, suggesting significant progress in AI language comprehension capabilities.

Abstract: From the dawn of the computer, Allen Turing dreamed of a robot that could
communicate using language as a human being. The recent advances in the field
of Large Language Models (LLMs) shocked the scientific community when a single
model can apply for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, while the
output results are sometimes even better than most human communication skills.
Models such as GPT, Claude, Grok, etc. have left their mark on the scientific
community. However, it is unclear how much these models understand what they
produce, especially in a nuanced theme such as humor. The question of whether
computers understand humor is still open (among the decoders, the latest to be
checked was GPT-2). We addressed this issue in this paper; we have showed that
a fine-tuned decoder (GPT-4o) performed (Mean F1-macro score of 0.85) as well
as the best fine-tuned encoder (RoBERTa with a Mean of F1-score 0.86)

*Yilei Chen,Souradip Chakraborty,Lorenz Wolf,Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis,Aldo Pacchiano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DQO method uses determinantal point processes to optimize LLMs for both quality and semantic diversity during training, addressing the diversity loss from standard fine-tuning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning often reduce output diversity in LLMs, leading to narrow canonical responses. Existing diversity enhancement methods are limited to inference-time operations or focus only on lexical differences.

Method: Proposes DQO training method based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) that samples multiple responses per prompt, embeds them, and uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to measure semantic diversity as the volume spanned by response embeddings.

Result: Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and reasoning tasks show substantial improvements in semantic diversity without sacrificing model quality.

Conclusion: DQO effectively addresses the diversity loss problem in LLM fine-tuning by jointly optimizing for quality and semantic diversity during training, outperforming existing limited approaches.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.

TL;DR: Systematic study of personality manipulation in LLMs using Big Five traits, comparing three methods (ICL, PEFT, MS) with trade-offs in alignment, capability, and deployment efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personality manipulation in LLMs is increasingly used in customer service and agentic scenarios, but the mechanisms and trade-offs remain unclear, requiring systematic investigation.

Method: Constructed contrastive dataset with balanced trait responses, developed unified evaluation framework using within-run Δ analysis, trait purification techniques, and three-level stability framework. Compared in-context learning (ICL), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS) on Gemma-2-2B-IT and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct.

Result: Clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers highest alignment but degrades task performance, MS provides lightweight runtime control with competitive effectiveness. Openness is uniquely challenging, agreeableness most resistant to ICL, personality encoding consolidates around intermediate layers.

Conclusion: Personality manipulation serves as multi-level probe into behavioral representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and activation-level steering. Mechanistic steering positioned as lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and interpretability.

Abstract: Personality manipulation in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly
applied in customer service and agentic scenarios, yet its mechanisms and
trade-offs remain unclear. We present a systematic study of personality control
using the Big Five traits, comparing in-context learning (ICL),
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), and mechanistic steering (MS). Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we construct a contrastive dataset with
balanced high/low trait responses, enabling effective steering vector
computation and fair cross-method evaluation. Second, we introduce a unified
evaluation framework based on within-run $\Delta$ analysis that disentangles,
reasoning capability, agent performance, and demographic bias across MMLU,
GAIA, and BBQ benchmarks. Third, we develop trait purification techniques to
separate openness from conscientiousness, addressing representational overlap
in trait encoding. Fourth, we propose a three-level stability framework that
quantifies method-, trait-, and combination-level robustness, offering
practical guidance under deployment constraints. Experiments on Gemma-2-2B-IT
and LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct reveal clear trade-offs: ICL achieves strong alignment
with minimal capability loss, PEFT delivers the highest alignment at the cost
of degraded task performance, and MS provides lightweight runtime control with
competitive effectiveness. Trait-level analysis shows openness as uniquely
challenging, agreeableness as most resistant to ICL, and personality encoding
consolidating around intermediate layers. Taken together, these results
establish personality manipulation as a multi-level probe into behavioral
representation, linking surface conditioning, parameter encoding, and
activation-level steering, and positioning mechanistic steering as a
lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for both deployment and
interpretability.

*Figarri Keisha,Zekun Wu,Ze Wang,Adriano Koshiyama,Philip Treleaven*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Synthetic data training causes knowledge collapse where models become confidently wrong while maintaining fluency, with collapse patterns depending on instruction format. Domain-specific synthetic training is proposed as an effective mitigation strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical issue of model collapse in LLMs when trained recursively on synthetic data, which threatens factual reliability in accuracy-dependent domains despite maintaining surface fluency.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, analyzed collapse trajectory based on instruction format, and proposed domain-specific synthetic training as mitigation. Used evaluation framework combining model-centric indicators and task-centric metrics.

Result: Demonstrated that collapse timing and trajectory depend on instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from traditional model collapse. Domain-specific synthetic training showed substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights into collapse dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in knowledge-intensive applications, with domain-specific synthetic training as an effective strategy to prevent knowledge deterioration while preserving fluency.

Abstract: Large language models increasingly rely on synthetic data due to
human-written content scarcity, yet recursive training on model-generated
outputs leads to model collapse, a degenerative process threatening factual
reliability. We define knowledge collapse as a distinct three-stage phenomenon
where factual accuracy deteriorates while surface fluency persists, creating
"confidently wrong" outputs that pose critical risks in accuracy-dependent
domains. Through controlled experiments with recursive synthetic training, we
demonstrate that collapse trajectory and timing depend critically on
instruction format, distinguishing instruction-following collapse from
traditional model collapse through its conditional, prompt-dependent nature. We
propose domain-specific synthetic training as a targeted mitigation strategy
that achieves substantial improvements in collapse resistance while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our evaluation framework combines model-centric
indicators with task-centric metrics to detect distinct degradation phases,
enabling reproducible assessment of epistemic deterioration across different
language models. These findings provide both theoretical insights into collapse
dynamics and practical guidance for sustainable AI training in
knowledge-intensive applications where accuracy is paramount.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces PRIM dataset and VisTrans model for practical in-image multilingual machine translation, addressing limitations of existing synthetic data approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current IIMT research uses synthetic data with simple backgrounds, single fonts, and fixed text positions, creating a significant gap with real-world conditions. The authors aim to facilitate research in practical scenarios.

Method: Created PRIM dataset with real-world captured text images featuring complex backgrounds, various fonts, diverse text positions, and multilingual support. Proposed VisTrans model that processes visual text and background information separately to handle practical conditions.

Result: VisTrans achieves better translation quality and visual effects compared to other models, demonstrating improved performance in practical IIMT scenarios.

Conclusion: The PRIM dataset and VisTrans model successfully address the limitations of synthetic data approaches and enable more realistic research in in-image multilingual machine translation.

Abstract: In-Image Machine Translation (IIMT) aims to translate images containing texts
from one language to another. Current research of end-to-end IIMT mainly
conducts on synthetic data, with simple background, single font, fixed text
position, and bilingual translation, which can not fully reflect real world,
causing a significant gap between the research and practical conditions. To
facilitate research of IIMT in real-world scenarios, we explore Practical
In-Image Multilingual Machine Translation (IIMMT). In order to convince the
lack of publicly available data, we annotate the PRIM dataset, which contains
real-world captured one-line text images with complex background, various
fonts, diverse text positions, and supports multilingual translation
directions. We propose an end-to-end model VisTrans to handle the challenge of
practical conditions in PRIM, which processes visual text and background
information in the image separately, ensuring the capability of multilingual
translation while improving the visual quality. Experimental results indicate
the VisTrans achieves a better translation quality and visual effect compared
to other models. The code and dataset are available at:

*Ilham Wicaksono,Zekun Wu,Theo King,Adriano Koshiyama,Philip Treleaven*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgentSeer is a new framework that evaluates AI agent safety by analyzing execution graphs, revealing critical vulnerabilities that traditional model-level testing misses, particularly in tool-calling scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety evaluation frameworks are inadequate for assessing deployment-specific risks in agentic AI systems, as they fail to capture vulnerabilities that emerge only in agentic contexts.

Method: AgentSeer decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs for systematic assessment. Cross-model validation was conducted on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench attacks including single turn and iterative refinement attacks.

Result: Agentic-level assessment revealed 'agentic-only' vulnerabilities with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher attack success rates. Direct attack transfers from model-level to agentic contexts showed degraded performance, while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromised objectives that failed at model-level.

Conclusion: There is an urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms, and AgentSeer provides the standardized methodology and empirical validation to address systematic evaluation gaps in AI agent safety.

Abstract: As large language models transition to agentic systems, current safety
evaluation frameworks face critical gaps in assessing deployment-specific
risks. We introduce AgentSeer, an observability-based evaluation framework that
decomposes agentic executions into granular action and component graphs,
enabling systematic agentic-situational assessment. Through cross-model
validation on GPT-OSS-20B and Gemini-2.0-flash using HarmBench single turn and
iterative refinement attacks, we demonstrate fundamental differences between
model-level and agentic-level vulnerability profiles. Model-level evaluation
reveals baseline differences: GPT-OSS-20B (39.47% ASR) versus Gemini-2.0-flash
(50.00% ASR), with both models showing susceptibility to social engineering
while maintaining logic-based attack resistance. However, agentic-level
assessment exposes agent-specific risks invisible to traditional evaluation. We
discover "agentic-only" vulnerabilities that emerge exclusively in agentic
contexts, with tool-calling showing 24-60% higher ASR across both models.
Cross-model analysis reveals universal agentic patterns, agent transfer
operations as highest-risk tools, semantic rather than syntactic vulnerability
mechanisms, and context-dependent attack effectiveness, alongside
model-specific security profiles in absolute ASR levels and optimal injection
strategies. Direct attack transfer from model-level to agentic contexts shows
degraded performance (GPT-OSS-20B: 57% human injection ASR; Gemini-2.0-flash:
28%), while context-aware iterative attacks successfully compromise objectives
that failed at model-level, confirming systematic evaluation gaps. These
findings establish the urgent need for agentic-situation evaluation paradigms,
with AgentSeer providing the standardized methodology and empirical validation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether inflectional classes are cognitively necessary for language learning, or if computational models can learn proper inflection patterns without explicitly defining these classes.

Method: Used DLM models with Finnish noun data (2000 high-frequency nouns, 55,271 inflected forms). Tested both endstate learning (infinite exposure) and frequency-informed learning (token frequency consideration) for comprehension and production tasks.

Result: Models achieved high accuracy on training data. For test data, performance decreased but remained acceptable. Performance correlated with class productivity - better for productive classes with more types and lower-frequency words. Frequency was dominant predictor for usage-based production models.

Conclusion: DLM can learn Finnish noun inflection patterns without explicit inflectional classes, suggesting these classes may not be cognitively necessary for language acquisition. Performance patterns mirror natural language productivity effects.

Abstract: Descriptions of complex nominal or verbal systems make use of inflectional
classes. Inflectional classes bring together nouns which have similar stem
changes and use similar exponents in their paradigms. Although inflectional
classes can be very useful for language teaching as well as for setting up
finite state morphological systems, it is unclear whether inflectional classes
are cognitively real, in the sense that native speakers would need to discover
these classes in order to learn how to properly inflect the nouns of their
language. This study investigates whether the Discriminative Lexicon Model
(DLM) can understand and produce Finnish inflected nouns without setting up
inflectional classes, using a dataset with 55,271 inflected nouns of 2000
high-frequency Finnish nouns from 49 inflectional classes. Several DLM
comprehension and production models were set up. Some models were not informed
about frequency of use, and provide insight into learnability with infinite
exposure (endstate learning). Other models were set up from a usage based
perspective, and were trained with token frequencies being taken into
consideration (frequency-informed learning). On training data, models performed
with very high accuracies. For held-out test data, accuracies decreased, as
expected, but remained acceptable. Across most models, performance increased
for inflectional classes with more types, more lower-frequency words, and more
hapax legomena, mirroring the productivity of the inflectional classes. The
model struggles more with novel forms of unproductive and less productive
classes, and performs far better for unseen forms belonging to productive
classes. However, for usage-based production models, frequency was the dominant
predictor of model performance, and correlations with measures of productivity
were tenuous or absent.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses challenges in SLU development including scarcity of labeled training data and computational burden of deploying large language models in real-world applications.

Method: Uses GTE-based teacher model to transfer semantic representations to student model. Introduces dynamic adapter with Residual Projection Neural Network to align feature spaces and Dynamic Distillation Coefficient that adaptively modulates distillation strength based on real-time prediction performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Chinese ProSLU benchmark: 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score, and 85.50% overall accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed AFD-SLU framework effectively addresses data scarcity and computational efficiency issues in SLU systems while achieving superior performance through adaptive knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) is a core component of conversational
systems, enabling machines to interpret user utterances. Despite its
importance, developing effective SLU systems remains challenging due to the
scarcity of labeled training data and the computational burden of deploying
Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. To further alleviate
these issues, we propose an Adaptive Feature Distillation framework that
transfers rich semantic representations from a General Text Embeddings
(GTE)-based teacher model to a lightweight student model. Our method introduces
a dynamic adapter equipped with a Residual Projection Neural Network (RPNN) to
align heterogeneous feature spaces, and a Dynamic Distillation Coefficient
(DDC) that adaptively modulates the distillation strength based on real-time
feedback from intent and slot prediction performance. Experiments on the
Chinese profile-based ProSLU benchmark demonstrate that AFD-SLU achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 95.67% intent accuracy, 92.02% slot F1 score,
and 85.50% overall accuracy.

*Boxiang Ma,Ru Li,Yuanlong Wang,Hongye Tan,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show impressive performance but lack deep semantic understanding, relying mainly on memorization rather than true scenario cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs' generalization comes from memorization or genuine semantic understanding of scenarios and their elements.

Method: Proposed a bi-perspective evaluation framework using a novel scenario-based dataset with fictional facts, assessing both model outputs and internal representations for scenario element-argument associations.

Result: Current LLMs predominantly rely on superficial memorization and fail to achieve robust semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases.

Conclusion: The findings expose critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and provide cognitive insights for advancing their capabilities beyond mere memorization.

Abstract: Driven by vast and diverse textual data, large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated impressive performance across numerous natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Yet, a critical question persists: does their generalization arise
from mere memorization of training data or from deep semantic understanding? To
investigate this, we propose a bi-perspective evaluation framework to assess
LLMs' scenario cognition - the ability to link semantic scenario elements with
their arguments in context. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario-based
dataset comprising diverse textual descriptions of fictional facts, annotated
with scenario elements. LLMs are evaluated through their capacity to answer
scenario-related questions (model output perspective) and via probing their
internal representations for encoded scenario elements-argument associations
(internal representation perspective). Our experiments reveal that current LLMs
predominantly rely on superficial memorization, failing to achieve robust
semantic scenario cognition, even in simple cases. These findings expose
critical limitations in LLMs' semantic understanding and offer cognitive
insights for advancing their capabilities.

*Sylvia Vassileva,Ivan Koychev,Svetla Boytcheva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automated ICD-10 coding system using LLMs with dictionary matching and GPT-4.1 for clinical term linking across languages


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Simplify healthcare professionals' work and ensure consistent disease coding in hospitals by automating ICD-10 code assignment from clinical texts

Method: Multistage pipeline using clinical dictionaries for unambiguous term matching, followed by in-context learning with GPT-4.1 for remaining terms

Result: Promising performance: 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 for subcategories on Spanish CodiEsp dataset; 0.85 F1 on Greek ElCardioCC dataset

Conclusion: LLM-based approach effectively automates clinical entity linking to ICD-10 codes across multiple languages with strong benchmark results

Abstract: The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured
information from clinical texts. It is the process of assigning a code from a
medical ontology or classification to a phrase in the text. The International
Classification of Diseases - 10th revision (ICD-10) is an international
standard for classifying diseases for statistical and insurance purposes.
Automatically assigning the correct ICD-10 code to terms in discharge summaries
will simplify the work of healthcare professionals and ensure consistent coding
in hospitals. Our paper proposes an approach for linking clinical terms to
ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on
different benchmark datasets in Spanish - 0.89 F1 for categories and 0.78 F1 on
subcategories on CodiEsp, and Greek - 0.85 F1 on ElCardioCC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: L1RA is a novel technique that dynamically distributes rank allocation for low-rank adapters during LLM fine-tuning using L1 regularization to optimize resource usage while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational requirements for fine-tuning large language models pose significant challenges, especially when resources are limited, necessitating more efficient adaptation methods.

Method: L1RA uses L1 regularization to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters within a given rank budget during LoRA-based fine-tuning.

Result: L1RA maintains comparable or reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants while achieving same or better performance, and reveals that feed-forward layers and attention output projection require most adaptation.

Conclusion: L1RA is an effective technique for enhancing LLM fine-tuning efficiency and providing diagnostic insights, particularly valuable in resource-constrained scenarios.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex tasks has made
them crucial in the development of AI-based applications. However, the high
computational requirements to fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks pose
significant challenges, particularly when resources are limited. In response to
this challenge, we introduce L1RA, a novel technique aimed at dynamically
distributing the rank of low-rank adapters during fine-tuning using LoRA. Given
a rank budget (i.e., total sum of adapters rank), L1RA leverages L1
regularisation to prune redundant ranks and redistribute them across adapters,
thereby optimising resource utilisation. Through a series of comprehensive
experiments, we empirically demonstrate that L1RA maintains comparable or even
reduced computational overhead compared to other LoRA variants, including the
vanilla approach, while achieving same or better performances. Moreover, the
post-training analysis of rank distribution unveiled insights into the specific
model components requiring the most adaptation to align with the task
objective: the feed-forward layers and the attention output projection. These
results highlight the efficacy of L1RA in not only enhancing the efficiency of
LLM fine-tuning, but also in providing valuable diagnostic information for
model refinement and customisation. In conclusion, L1RA stands as a promising
technique for advancing the performance and interpretability of LLM adaptation,
particularly in scenarios where computational resources are constrained.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized open models in instruction-following, language fluency, and Japanese-specific knowledge with minimal accuracy loss through quantization.

Conclusion: PLaMo 2 demonstrates that efficient architecture design, synthetic data utilization, and optimized pruning can produce compact yet highly capable Japanese language models that rival much larger predecessors in performance.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce PLaMo 2, a series of Japanese-focused large
language models featuring a hybrid Samba-based architecture that transitions to
full attention via continual pre-training to support 32K token contexts.
Training leverages extensive synthetic corpora to overcome data scarcity, while
computational efficiency is achieved through weight reuse and structured

performance comparable to our previous 100B model. Post-training further
refines the models using a pipeline of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct
preference optimization (DPO), enhanced by synthetic Japanese instruction data
and model merging techniques. Optimized for inference using vLLM and
quantization with minimal accuracy loss, the PLaMo 2 models achieve
state-of-the-art results on Japanese benchmarks, outperforming similarly-sized

*Jianghao Chen,Wei Sun,Qixiang Yin,Lingxing Kong,Zhixing Tan,Jiajun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ACE-RL framework uses adaptive constraint-enhanced reinforcement learning to improve LLM long-form generation by automatically identifying fine-grained constraints from instructions and converting quality evaluation into constraint verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLMs struggle with high-quality long-form generation due to reliance on scarce training data and focus on coarse-grained quality metrics, overlooking fine-grained specifics of different generation scenarios.

Method: Proposes ACE-RL framework that: 1) automatically deconstructs instructions into fine-grained constraint criteria, 2) designs reward mechanism based on constraint satisfaction, 3) uses reinforcement learning to train models for better long-form generation.

Result: Outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and 7.32% on WritingBench, with top model surpassing GPT-4o by 7.10%.

Conclusion: ACE-RL provides an effective training paradigm for LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation scenarios by focusing on fine-grained constraint verification rather than subjective quality evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
long-context understanding, yet they face significant challenges in
high-quality long-form generation. Existing studies primarily suffer from two
limitations: (1) A heavy reliance on scarce, high-quality long-form response
data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or for pairwise preference reward in
reinforcement learning (RL). (2) Focus on coarse-grained quality optimization
dimensions, such as relevance, coherence, and helpfulness, overlooking the
fine-grained specifics inherent to diverse long-form generation scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a framework using Adaptive Constraint-Enhanced
reward for long-form generation Reinforcement Learning (ACE-RL). ACE-RL first
automatically deconstructs each instruction into a set of fine-grained,
adaptive constraint criteria by identifying its underlying intents and demands.
Subsequently, we design a reward mechanism that quantifies the quality of
long-form responses based on their satisfaction over corresponding constraints,
converting subjective quality evaluation into constraint verification. Finally,
we utilize reinforcement learning to guide models toward superior long-form
generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our ACE-RL
framework significantly outperforms existing SFT and RL baselines by 20.70% and
7.32% on WritingBench, and our top-performing model even surpasses proprietary
systems like GPT-4o by 7.10%, providing a more effective training paradigm for
LLMs to generate high-quality content across diverse long-form generation
scenarios.

*Midhun Shyam,Jim Basilakis,Kieran Luken,Steven Thomas,John Crozier,Paul M. Middleton,X. Rosalind Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A pipeline for classifying sensitive triage data using limited compute resources by fine-tuning LLMs with small datasets on both GPU and CPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Triage notes contain valuable medical information but face challenges: privacy regulations requiring on-site analysis, lack of hardware for LLM fine-tuning, and costly manual labeling by experts.

Method: Fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with classifier using 2k open-source dataset on GPU, then further fine-tuned with hospital-specific 1k samples on CPU.

Result: Successfully classified triage data with limited compute resources through careful dataset curation and leveraging existing models.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables effective triage data classification despite hardware constraints and privacy requirements, making LLM analysis accessible to medical facilities with limited resources.

Abstract: Triage notes, created at the start of a patient's hospital visit, contain a
wealth of information that can help medical staff and researchers understand
Emergency Department patient epidemiology and the degree of time-dependent
illness or injury. Unfortunately, applying modern Natural Language Processing
and Machine Learning techniques to analyse triage data faces some challenges:
Firstly, hospital data contains highly sensitive information that is subject to
privacy regulation thus need to be analysed on site; Secondly, most hospitals
and medical facilities lack the necessary hardware to fine-tune a Large
Language Model (LLM), much less training one from scratch; Lastly, to identify
the records of interest, expert inputs are needed to manually label the
datasets, which can be time-consuming and costly. We present in this paper a
pipeline that enables the classification of triage data using LLM and limited
compute resources. We first fine-tuned a pre-trained LLM with a classifier
using a small (2k) open sourced dataset on a GPU; and then further fine-tuned
the model with a hospital specific dataset of 1000 samples on a CPU. We
demonstrated that by carefully curating the datasets and leveraging existing
models and open sourced data, we can successfully classify triage data with
limited compute resources.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small Transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa) evaluated for multi-label sentiment classification on short texts, testing domain pre-training, data augmentation, and classification head modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Short text sentiment classification faces challenges like class imbalance, limited training data, and subjectivity, exacerbated by limited context and data sparsity.

Method: Evaluated three factors: continued domain-specific pre-training, generative data augmentation, and architectural variations of classification heads using BERT/RoBERTa models (<1B parameters).

Result: Data augmentation improves performance, continued pre-training on augmented data introduces noise instead of boosting accuracy, and classification head modifications provide only marginal benefits.

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained settings and refining strategies for short-text sentiment classification.

Abstract: Sentiment classification in short text datasets faces significant challenges
such as class imbalance, limited training samples, and the inherent
subjectivity of sentiment labels -- issues that are further intensified by the
limited context in short texts. These factors make it difficult to resolve
ambiguity and exacerbate data sparsity, hindering effective learning. In this
paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of small Transformer-based models (i.e.,
BERT and RoBERTa, with fewer than 1 billion parameters) for multi-label
sentiment classification, with a particular focus on short-text settings.
Specifically, we evaluated three key factors influencing model performance: (1)
continued domain-specific pre-training, (2) data augmentation using
automatically generated examples, specifically generative data augmentation,
and (3) architectural variations of the classification head. Our experiment
results show that data augmentation improves classification performance, while
continued pre-training on augmented datasets can introduce noise rather than
boost accuracy. Furthermore, we confirm that modifications to the
classification head yield only marginal benefits. These findings provide
practical guidance for optimizing BERT-based models in resource-constrained
settings and refining strategies for sentiment classification in short-text
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fundamental design dilemma in conversational AI: whether explicit intent recognition is a prerequisite for generating high-quality service responses or if models can produce effective replies directly.

Method: Used two publicly available service interaction datasets to benchmark state-of-the-art language models (including fine-tuned T5 variant) across Intent-First Response Generation vs Direct Response Generation paradigms.

Result: Evaluation across linguistic quality and task success rates revealed surprising insights, showing that explicit intent modeling may not always be necessary for effective response generation.

Conclusion: The findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines and provide actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective response generation systems.

Abstract: In the era of conversational AI, generating accurate and contextually
appropriate service responses remains a critical challenge. A central question
remains: Is explicit intent recognition a prerequisite for generating
high-quality service responses, or can models bypass this step and produce
effective replies directly? This paper conducts a rigorous comparative study to
address this fundamental design dilemma. Leveraging two publicly available
service interaction datasets, we benchmark several state-of-the-art language
models, including a fine-tuned T5 variant, across both paradigms: Intent-First
Response Generation and Direct Response Generation. Evaluation metrics
encompass both linguistic quality and task success rates, revealing surprising
insights into the necessity or redundancy of explicit intent modelling. Our
findings challenge conventional assumptions in conversational AI pipelines,
offering actionable guidelines for designing more efficient and effective

TL;DR: Entropy2Vec is a novel framework that uses language model entropy to create cross-lingual representations, capturing typological relationships through prediction uncertainty instead of traditional sparse typological features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional typological inventories suffer from feature sparsity and provide static snapshots, limiting their effectiveness for capturing dynamic language relationships and structural similarities across languages.

Method: The approach trains language models on individual languages and uses the entropy of their predictions as a measure of structural similarity - low entropy indicates high similarity to other languages, while high entropy suggests divergence, producing dense, adaptable language embeddings.

Result: Empirical evaluations show that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established typological categories and achieve competitive performance in downstream multilingual NLP tasks, particularly those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

Conclusion: Entropy2Vec provides a novel, effective method for deriving cross-lingual representations that overcome limitations of traditional typological approaches, offering dense, non-sparse embeddings that capture language relationships through model uncertainty.

Abstract: We introduce Entropy2Vec, a novel framework for deriving cross-lingual
language representations by leveraging the entropy of monolingual language
models. Unlike traditional typological inventories that suffer from feature
sparsity and static snapshots, Entropy2Vec uses the inherent uncertainty in
language models to capture typological relationships between languages. By
training a language model on a single language, we hypothesize that the entropy
of its predictions reflects its structural similarity to other languages: Low
entropy indicates high similarity, while high entropy suggests greater
divergence. This approach yields dense, non-sparse language embeddings that are
adaptable to different timeframes and free from missing values. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that Entropy2Vec embeddings align with established
typological categories and achieved competitive performance in downstream
multilingual NLP tasks, such as those addressed by the LinguAlchemy framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ToM benchmarks are limited to simple text-based or dyadic interactions using Sally-Anne test variations, failing to capture the complexity of real human social interactions and spatial dynamics.

Method: Proposed ToM-SSI benchmark that is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to four agents communicating and moving in situated environments, enabling study of mixed cooperative-obstructive settings and parallel mental state reasoning.

Result: Evaluations show current models' performance is severely limited, especially in these new complex tasks involving multiple agents and spatial dynamics.

Conclusion: The benchmark highlights critical gaps in current foundation models' Theory of Mind capabilities and provides a more comprehensive framework for future research on social cognition in AI systems.

Abstract: Most existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks for foundation models rely on
variations of the Sally-Anne test, offering only a very limited perspective on
ToM and neglecting the complexity of human social interactions. To address this
gap, we propose ToM-SSI: a new benchmark specifically designed to test ToM
capabilities in environments rich with social interactions and spatial
dynamics. While current ToM benchmarks are limited to text-only or dyadic
interactions, ToM-SSI is multimodal and includes group interactions of up to
four agents that communicate and move in situated environments. This unique
design allows us to study, for the first time, mixed cooperative-obstructive
settings and reasoning about multiple agents' mental state in parallel, thus
capturing a wider range of social cognition than existing benchmarks. Our
evaluations reveal that the current models' performance is still severely
limited, especially in these new tasks, highlighting critical gaps for future
research.

TL;DR: ICR framework uses iterative clarification questions and query rewriting to handle multiple fuzzy expressions in conversational queries, achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end query rewriting struggles with multiple fuzzy expressions that require simultaneous identification and rewriting at multiple positions.

Method: Proposed ICR framework with iterative process alternating between generating clarification questions and rewritten queries.

Result: ICR continuously improves retrieval performance through iterative process and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets.

Conclusion: Iterative clarification-rewriting approach effectively addresses the limitations of end-to-end rewriting for conversational queries with multiple fuzzy expressions.

Abstract: Most previous work on Conversational Query Rewriting employs an end-to-end
rewriting paradigm. However, this approach is hindered by the issue of multiple
fuzzy expressions within the query, which complicates the simultaneous
identification and rewriting of multiple positions. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework ICR (Iterative Clarification and Rewriting), an
iterative rewriting scheme that pivots on clarification questions. Within this
framework, the model alternates between generating clarification questions and
rewritten queries. The experimental results show that our ICR can continuously
improve retrieval performance in the clarification-rewriting iterative process,
thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets.

TL;DR: TAXAL is a triadic framework for explainable AI that combines cognitive, functional, and causal dimensions to provide better explanations for agentic LLMs in high-risk domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional explainability methods fail to capture the reasoning pathways and systemic impacts of agentic LLMs, undermining trust and accountability in high-risk domains.

Method: TAXAL framework unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive (user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful reasoning) through a triadic fusion approach.

Result: The framework synthesizes existing methods and demonstrates applicability through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services with role-sensitive explanation strategies.

Conclusion: TAXAL advances explainability as both technical and sociotechnical practice, supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of agentic AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in high-risk
domains where opacity, bias, and instability undermine trust and
accountability. Traditional explainability methods, focused on surface outputs,
do not capture the reasoning pathways, planning logic, and systemic impacts of
agentic LLMs.
  We introduce TAXAL (Triadic Alignment for eXplainability in Agentic LLMs), a
triadic fusion framework that unites three complementary dimensions: cognitive
(user understanding), functional (practical utility), and causal (faithful
reasoning). TAXAL provides a unified, role-sensitive foundation for designing,
evaluating, and deploying explanations in diverse sociotechnical settings.
  Our analysis synthesizes existing methods, ranging from post-hoc attribution
and dialogic interfaces to explanation-aware prompting, and situates them
within the TAXAL triadic fusion model. We further demonstrate its applicability
through case studies in law, education, healthcare, and public services,
showing how explanation strategies adapt to institutional constraints and
stakeholder roles.
  By combining conceptual clarity with design patterns and deployment pathways,
TAXAL advances explainability as a technical and sociotechnical practice,
supporting trustworthy and context-sensitive LLM applications in the era of

Result: Significantly outperforms comparable translation-specific models and most SOTA large models. Ranked first in 30 out of 31 language pairs in WMT2025 shared task, demonstrating robustness across high-resource and low-resource languages.

Conclusion: The Hunyuan-MT models represent state-of-the-art multilingual translation capabilities, particularly excelling in Mandarin-minority language translation and demonstrating the effectiveness of the slow-thinking Chimera approach for enhanced performance.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-7B, our first open-source
multilingual translation model, which supports bidirectional translation across
33 major languages and places a special emphasis on translation between
Mandarin and several ethnic minority languages as well as dialects.
Furthermore, to serve and address diverse translation scenarios and enhance
model performance at test time, we introduce Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B, a
translation model inspired by the slow thinking mode. This model integrates
multiple outputs generated by the Hunyuan-MT-7B model under varying parameter
settings, thereby achieving performance superior to that of conventional
slow-thinking models based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT). The development of our
models follows a holistic training process specifically engineered for
multilingual translation, which begins with general and MT-oriented
pre-training to build foundational capabilities, proceeds to Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) for task-specific adaptation, and culminates in advanced
alignment through Reinforcement Learning (RL) and weak-to-strong RL. Through
comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that both Hunyuan-MT-7B and
Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B significantly outperform all translation-specific models
of comparable parameter size and most of the SOTA large models, particularly on
the task of translation between Mandarin and minority languages as well as
dialects. In the WMT2025 shared task (General Machine Translation), our models
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, ranking first in 30 out of 31
language pairs. This result highlights the robustness of our models across a
diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing high-resource languages such as
Chinese, English, and Japanese, as well as low-resource languages including
Czech, Marathi, Estonian, and Icelandic.

*Medhasweta Sen,Zachary Gottesman,Jiaxing Qiu,C. Bayan Bruss,Nam Nguyen,Tom Hartvigsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a standardized benchmark for evaluating time series foundation models on three natural language tasks (recognition, differentiation, generation) using unified datasets, revealing that language-only models underperform while vision-language models show promise but need improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of direct comparisons and standardized evaluation for time series foundation models, as previous works often introduce new datasets with their models, limiting fair comparisons and obscuring specific model capabilities.

Method: Formalize three natural language description tasks (True/False QA, multiple choice QA, open-ended description), unify four existing datasets, and evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models across language, vision-language, and time series-language architectures.

Result: Language-only methods largely underperform, vision-language models perform well (demonstrating value of vision models), and pretrained multimodal time series-language models outperform LLMs but still have significant room for improvement. All models show fragility in robustness tests.

Conclusion: The benchmark provides standardized evaluation for time series reasoning systems, highlighting the need for time series-specific architectures and showing that current models, while promising, require further development and robustness improvements.

Abstract: Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.

*Chang Dai,Hongyu Shan,Mingyang Song,Di Liang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HoPE introduces hyperbolic rotary positional encoding to overcome limitations of existing methods like RoPE, enabling better long-range dependency modeling through geometric reformulation inspired by Lorentz transformations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current positional encoding methods - absolute encodings struggle with extrapolation, relative approaches degrade on extremely long contexts, and RoPE has oscillatory attention patterns that hinder stable long-distance modeling.

Method: Propose Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE) using hyperbolic functions to implement Lorentz rotations on token representations, drawing from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows RoPE is a special case of HoPE. Extensive experiments demonstrate HoPE consistently outperforms existing positional encoding methods in perplexity evaluations on extended sequence benchmarks.

Conclusion: HoPE fundamentally resolves RoPE's issues by enforcing monotonic decay of attention weights with increasing token distances, enhancing capacity for representing and generalizing long-range dependencies.

Abstract: Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.

*Abdul Waheed,Chancharik Mitra,Laurie Z. Wang,Deva Ramanan,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for difficulty-aware reasoning that enables models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity without architectural changes, using curated chain-of-thought data proportional to difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought reasoning often produces unnecessarily verbose output for simpler problems, creating inefficiency in model reasoning processes.

Method: Post-train models on carefully curated data with chain-of-thought traces proportional to problem difficulty, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) techniques.

Result: Models learn to "think proportionally" - reasoning minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones, with reduced reasoning length and maintained or improved performance.

Conclusion: Models can be effectively taught dynamic inference pathways through curated training data, achieving efficient difficulty-aware reasoning without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought reasoning, while powerful, can produce unnecessarily verbose
output for simpler problems. We present a framework for difficulty-aware
reasoning that teaches models to dynamically adjust reasoning depth based on
problem complexity. Remarkably, we show that models can be endowed with such
dynamic inference pathways without any architectural modifications; we simply
post-train on data that is carefully curated to include chain-of-thought traces
that are proportional in length to problem difficulty. Our analysis reveals
that post-training via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) primarily captures patterns
like reasoning length and format, while direct preference optimization (DPO)
preserves reasoning accuracy, with their combination reducing length and
maintaining or improving performance. Both quantitative metrics and qualitative
assessments confirm that models can learn to "think proportionally", reasoning
minimally on simple problems while maintaining depth for complex ones.

*Aysenur Kocak,Shuo Yang,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CURE is a lightweight framework that disentangles and suppresses conceptual shortcuts in pre-trained language models while preserving essential content, achieving significant performance improvements with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained language models are susceptible to spurious concept-driven correlations that impair robustness and fairness, requiring methods to address these biases without losing task-relevant information.

Method: Uses a content extractor with reversal network to get concept-irrelevant representations, followed by a controllable debiasing module with contrastive learning to adjust residual conceptual cues.

Result: Achieves +10 points F1 improvement on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp across three pre-trained architectures with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: Provides a flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, enabling more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications but remain susceptible to spurious, concept-driven correlations
that impair robustness and fairness. In this work, we introduce CURE, a novel
and lightweight framework that systematically disentangles and suppresses
conceptual shortcuts while preserving essential content information. Our method
first extracts concept-irrelevant representations via a dedicated content
extractor reinforced by a reversal network, ensuring minimal loss of
task-relevant information. A subsequent controllable debiasing module employs
contrastive learning to finely adjust the influence of residual conceptual
cues, enabling the model to either diminish harmful biases or harness
beneficial correlations as appropriate for the target task. Evaluated on the
IMDB and Yelp datasets using three pre-trained architectures, CURE achieves an
absolute improvement of +10 points in F1 score on IMDB and +2 points on Yelp,
while introducing minimal computational overhead. Our approach establishes a
flexible, unsupervised blueprint for combating conceptual biases, paving the
way for more reliable and fair language understanding systems.

*Hailin Hao,Elsi Kaiser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Replication study confirms that English complementizer 'that' omission follows Uniform Information Density principles - more likely to be omitted in predictable/low-information contexts, with neural language models providing better predictive power than traditional measures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit and advance research on the Uniform Information Density hypothesis by examining complementizer 'that' omission patterns using modern computational methods and large conversational data.

Method: Analyzed a large-scale contemporary conversational corpus using machine learning and neural language models to refine information density estimates, comparing traditional subcategorization probability measures with contextual word embeddings.

Result: Replicated established relationship between information density and 'that'-mentioning. Found that neural language models based on contextual word embeddings account for additional variance in complementizer usage patterns compared to traditional lexical measures.

Conclusion: Contextual word embeddings provide superior estimates of information density for predicting complementizer omission, capturing more nuanced patterns than previous lexical-based approaches, supporting the Uniform Information Density hypothesis with modern computational methods.

Abstract: Speakers often have multiple ways to express the same meaning. The Uniform
Information Density (UID) hypothesis suggests that speakers exploit this
variability to maintain a consistent rate of information transmission during
language production. Building on prior work linking UID to syntactic reduction,
we revisit the finding that the optional complementizer $\textit{that}$in
English complement clauses is more likely to be omitted when the clause has low
information density (i.e., more predictable). We advance this line of research
by analyzing a large-scale, contemporary conversational corpus and using
machine learning and neural language models to refine estimates of information
density. Our results replicated the established relationship between
information density and $\textit{that}$-mentioning. However, we found that
previous measures of information density based on matrix verbs'
subcategorization probability capture substantial idiosyncratic lexical
variation. By contrast, estimates derived from contextual word embeddings
account for additional variance in patterns of complementizer usage.

*Zhen Qin,Xuyang Shen,Yiran Zhong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comprehensive analysis of decay mechanisms in linear complexity sequence models, examining parameterization strategies, parameter sharing, decay granularity, and RoPE compatibility, with key findings on optimal configurations and performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate and understand the decay mechanisms in linear complexity sequence models across multiple design dimensions to identify optimal configurations and performance characteristics.

Method: Systematic delineation of decay mechanism design space across four dimensions: parameterization strategy, parameter sharing, decay granularity (scalar vs vector), and RoPE compatibility. Extensive experiments on diverse language modeling tasks.

Result: Key insights: 1) Parameterization strategy requires careful tuning within specific ranges; 2) Parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily as it affects decay values and performance; 3) Scalar decay generally underperforms vector decay but can surpass it in certain scenarios; 4) RoPE typically fails to benefit most linear attention mechanisms.

Conclusion: Decay mechanism design requires meticulous consideration across multiple dimensions, with specific optimal configurations identified. RoPE compatibility is limited, and careful parameter tuning is essential for effective linear attention performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the decay mechanisms
inherent in linear complexity sequence models. We systematically delineate the
design space of decay mechanisms across four pivotal dimensions:
parameterization strategy, which refers to the computational methodology for
decay; parameter sharing, which involves the utilization of supplementary
parameters for decay computation; decay granularity, comparing scalar versus
vector-based decay; and compatibility with relative positional encoding
methods, such as Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Through an extensive series
of experiments conducted on diverse language modeling tasks, we uncovered
several critical insights. Firstly, the design of the parameterization strategy
for decay requires meticulous consideration. Our findings indicate that
effective configurations are typically confined to a specific range of
parameters. Secondly, parameter sharing cannot be used arbitrarily, as it may
cause decay values to be too large or too small, thereby significantly
impacting performance. Thirdly, under identical parameterization strategies,
scalar decay generally underperforms compared to its vector-based counterpart.
However, in certain scenarios with alternative parameterization strategies,
scalar decay may unexpectedly surpass vector decay in efficacy. Lastly, our
analysis reveals that RoPE, a commonly employed relative positional encoding
method, typically fails to provide tangible benefits to the majority of linear
attention mechanisms.

*Deniz Bayazit,Aaron Mueller,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method using sparse crosscoders to track the emergence and evolution of linguistic features in LLMs during pretraining, with a novel metric called Relative Indirect Effects (RelIE) to identify when specific features become causally important.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional benchmarking methods fail to reveal how language models acquire specific concepts and capabilities during pretraining, creating a gap in understanding the developmental process of linguistic abilities in LLMs.

Method: The researchers use sparse crosscoders between open-sourced checkpoint triplets to discover and align features across model checkpoints, introducing a novel metric (RelIE) to trace when individual features become causally important for task performance.

Result: The approach successfully detects feature emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining, demonstrating that crosscoders can effectively track the evolution of linguistic features.

Conclusion: This architecture-agnostic and scalable method provides a promising path toward more interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout the pretraining process.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) learn non-trivial abstractions during
pretraining, like detecting irregular plural noun subjects. However, it is not
well understood when and how specific linguistic abilities emerge as
traditional evaluation methods such as benchmarking fail to reveal how models
acquire concepts and capabilities. To bridge this gap and better understand
model training at the concept level, we use sparse crosscoders to discover and
align features across model checkpoints. Using this approach, we track the
evolution of linguistic features during pretraining. We train crosscoders
between open-sourced checkpoint triplets with significant performance and
representation shifts, and introduce a novel metric, Relative Indirect Effects
(RelIE), to trace training stages at which individual features become causally
important for task performance. We show that crosscoders can detect feature
emergence, maintenance, and discontinuation during pretraining. Our approach is
architecture-agnostic and scalable, offering a promising path toward more
interpretable and fine-grained analysis of representation learning throughout
pretraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study examines perceived risk in automated vehicles using driving simulator experiment, finds facial expression unreliable for risk assessment but neural network model using motion and physiological data shows promise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand factors affecting public acceptance of automated vehicles, particularly how driving style and critical interactions influence perceived risk and safety.

Method: 32 participants tested in driving simulator with two automated driving styles (calm vs dynamic) and optional pedestrian crossing scenario. Collected continuous subjective ratings, motion data, facial expressions, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking.

Result: Dynamic driving style caused stronger discomfort; pedestrian crossing doubled discomfort with dynamic style. Facial expressions unreliable - only 9/24 showed reactions (mostly Happy, not Fear). Neural network using motion and skin conductance data correlated well with reported perceived risk.

Conclusion: Facial expression recognition is unreliable for assessing perceived risk in automated vehicles, but objective measures like vehicle motion and physiological data can effectively predict perceived risk, reducing subjective bias.

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer is a universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances text-to-image models by generating more precise prompts through reinforcement learning, improving image-text alignment without modifying model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often fail to faithfully render complex user prompts, leading to significant mismatch between user intent and generated output, particularly in attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.

Method: A Chain-of-Thought rewriter trained through reinforcement learning guided by an AlignEvaluator reward model that provides fine-grained feedback based on 24 key points derived from common T2I failure modes.

Result: Extensive experiments on HunyuanImage 2.1 model show significant improvement in image-text alignment across various semantic and compositional challenges.

Conclusion: PromptEnhancer effectively enhances T2I models without weight modifications and introduces a new human preference benchmark for future research.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Motivation: Many open-source multimodal models prioritize scaling parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting efficiency and performance. The authors aim to develop a more efficient model with better training strategies.

Method: Architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium, large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, and a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement (PDTR) strategy that strengthens text-to-image generation and editing tasks in a staged manner without negative interference.

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than larger models (BAGEL 7B and Flux-Kontext 12B). The unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery achieves top-tier performance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed training paradigm (Skywork UniPic 2.0) is effective and generalizable, enabling state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters through optimized training strategies rather than simple parameter scaling.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag is a real-time drag-based image editing framework that uses pixel-space bidirectional warping and inpainting instead of latent space manipulation, achieving 0.01s warping previews and 0.3s inpainting at 512x512 resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing drag-based editing methods rely on latent space manipulation of generative models, which leads to limited precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints that hinder user experience.

Method: The framework decomposes drag editing into pixel-space bidirectional warping (treating image regions as deformable materials) and image inpainting, transforming drag inputs into standard inpainting formats that work with any inpainting model.

Result: Achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s), significantly faster than existing methods that require minutes per edit, while maintaining superior visual quality and precise control.

Conclusion: Inpaint4Drag serves as a universal adapter for any inpainting model without modification, automatically benefiting from future inpainting improvements, and provides a significantly improved interaction experience for drag-based image editing.

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH is a diffusion-based defense framework that uses generative models to neutralize adversarial patch attacks on object detectors through image regeneration and rectification, achieving state-of-the-art performance without requiring prior knowledge of attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art object detectors remain vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks that can conceal or create objects, posing serious real-world security risks. Current defense methods lack effectiveness, generalizability, and robustness against diverse and unknown attack types.

Method: DISPATCH employs a 'regenerate and rectify' strategy using diffusion models. It first regenerates the entire input image to align with benign data distribution, then identifies and replaces adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts, making it attack-agnostic.

Result: Extensive experiments show DISPATCH outperforms state-of-the-art defenses, achieving 89.3% mAP.5 on hiding attacks and reducing attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks. It maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: DISPATCH provides an effective, generalizable, and robust defense framework against adversarial patch attacks for object detection systems, making it a practical solution for real-world security applications.

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

TL;DR: WATCH is a unified framework for global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos that addresses camera orientation and translation integration challenges through analytical heading angle decomposition and world model-inspired trajectory integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is challenging due to depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and camera-human movement entanglement. Existing human-motion-centric approaches suffer from insufficient camera orientation exploitation and ineffective camera translation integration.

Method: WATCH introduces an analytical heading angle decomposition technique for efficient camera orientation handling and a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by world models for effective translation cue utilization.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end trajectory reconstruction on in-the-wild benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.

Conclusion: The work shows the effectiveness of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and provides new insights for addressing camera translation integration challenges in global human motion reconstruction.

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid is a saliency-aware framework that improves dense video captioning by converting timestamp annotations into frame importance weights and using semantic-based adaptive caption retrieval to handle scene transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end dense video captioning models treat all video frames equally and retrieve captions from fixed-size chunks, ignoring scene transitions and frame importance variations.

Method: Proposes Saliency-aware Video Reweighting (converts timestamp annotations to sigmoid-based frame weights) and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption Retrieval (segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene transitions).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on YouCook2 and ViTT datasets.

Conclusion: Jointly improving video weighting and retrieval through saliency awareness significantly benefits dense video captioning performance.

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba is a hybrid vision backbone that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with multi-directional Mamba SSMs for global context modeling, achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between CNNs (good at local features but poor global reasoning) and modern architectures like ViTs and SSMs (good global context but poor local features), creating a model that leverages the strengths of both approaches.

Method: Uses a convolutional stem and hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in early stages for local feature extraction, followed by multi-directional Mamba blocks in later stages for efficient long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity.

Result: VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K (surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters) and 47.1 mIoU on ADE20K (exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU with 62% fewer parameters).

Conclusion: The hybrid CNN-Mamba architecture successfully combines the strengths of both paradigms, delivering superior performance with significantly reduced parameter counts, making it an efficient and effective vision backbone.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at

### [103] [Guideline-Consistent Segmentation via Multi-Agent Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04687)
*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent framework that uses vision-language models to ensure semantic segmentation follows complex textual guidelines without retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world semantic segmentation requires strict adherence to complex, evolving textual labeling guidelines that current methods struggle with, necessitating expensive retraining.

Method: Multi-agent training-free framework with Worker-Supervisor architecture: Worker performs segmentation, Supervisor critiques against guidelines, and reinforcement learning stop policy terminates the loop.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on Waymo and ReasonSeg datasets, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses guideline compliance in semantic segmentation without retraining, balancing accuracy with resource efficiency.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes two techniques for adapting 3D object detection models across different LiDAR sensor configurations: Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning to address performance degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different vehicle platforms use distinct LiDAR sensor configurations, causing performance degradation due to point cloud distribution shifts when models trained on one configuration are applied to another. This domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely unexplored compared to environmental domain gaps.

Method: Two techniques: 1) Downstream Fine-tuning - dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training, and 2) Partial Layer Fine-tuning - updating only a subset of layers to improve cross-configuration generalization. Uses paired datasets collected in same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations.

Result: Joint training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each configuration.

Conclusion: Provides a practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to diverse vehicle platforms with different sensor configurations.

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

TL;DR: CD-Mamba: A hybrid cloud detection model combining CNN's local spatial processing with Mamba's long-range dependency modeling for improved remote sensing image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing images are often obscured by cloud cover, compromising data integrity. Effective cloud detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches.

Method: Propose CD-Mamba, a hybrid model that integrates convolutional neural networks (for local spatial dependencies) with Mamba's state-space modeling (for long-range dependencies) into a unified cloud detection network.

Result: Extensive experiments validate CD-Mamba's effectiveness and demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in cloud detection.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully captures both pixel-wise textural details and long-term patch-wise dependencies, improving detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales in remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

*Shengqian Zhu,Jiafei Wu,Xiaogang Xu,Chengrong Yu,Ying Song,Zhang Yi,Guangjun Li,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Task Consistency Training framework for medical image segmentation that addresses class imbalance in partially labeled datasets without requiring extra models, using consistency constraints and uncertainty-weighted loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current versatile medical image segmentation methods face significant class imbalance due to unequal category distribution in partially labeled datasets, and existing pseudo-label approaches require additional models and suffer from label noise.

Method: TCT framework with main segmentation head for multi-channel predictions and multiple auxiliary task heads with consistency constraints, filtering strategy for low-consistency data, and unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate the approach's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed TCT framework effectively addresses class imbalance in partially labeled medical image segmentation without requiring additional models, showing promising results across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

*Dharsan Ravindran,Kevin Wang,Zhuoyuan Cao,Saleh Abdelrahman,Jeffery Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM and SAM2 struggle in adverse weather due to lack of uncertainty quantification. The paper introduces uncertainty-aware finetuning for SAM2 and adapts medical imaging UAT to driving, showing improved performance in extreme weather conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models like SAM/SAM2 perform poorly in adverse weather conditions with high visual ambiguity, lacking uncertainty quantification needed for safety-critical autonomous driving applications.

Method: Two approaches: 1) Multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 incorporating uncertainty metrics into loss function, 2) Adapting Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT) from medical imaging to driving contexts.

Result: UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA datasets.

Conclusion: Explicit uncertainty modeling is valuable for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments, with both proposed methods showing enhanced robustness in adverse weather conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Conclusion: WatchHAR advances on-device activity recognition, enabling smartwatches as standalone, privacy-aware continuous tracking devices with minimal latency.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity

environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component
of the pipeline, WatchHAR achieves compounding performance gains. We introduce
a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while
maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal

realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet is a multi-label classification framework for hurricane damage assessment that uses multi-scale feature learning and class-specific attention to outperform existing methods, achieving 91.75% mAP on UAV imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods struggle with multi-scale spatial features and distinguishing visually similar damage types in post-hurricane assessment, which is critical for disaster response.

Method: MCANet uses a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone for multi-scale context and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to focus on relevant spatial regions for each damage category.

Result: Achieves 91.75% mAP on RescueNet dataset, outperforming ResNet, Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With 8 attention heads, improves to 92.35% mAP with 6%+ boost for challenging classes like Road Blocked.

Conclusion: MCANet effectively localizes damage regions and supports interpretability for disaster response applications. Future work could integrate knowledge graphs and multimodal LLMs for better adaptability and semantic understanding.

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: Proposes dynamic human group detection in videos using Vision-Language Model features and global optimization across frames to handle changing groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods assume static groups in videos, but real-world groups change dynamically. Both local appearance features and global context are needed for accurate complex group detection.

Method: Uses VLM augmented for group detection to extract local and global features. Employs global optimization with graph-based approach using groupness probabilities from groupness-augmented CLIP features across all frames.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively detects dynamically changing human groups in videos by combining VLM features with temporal consistency optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision is a zero-shot flood depth estimation framework that combines GPT-4o's semantic reasoning with a domain knowledge graph of real-world object dimensions, achieving 8.17 cm MAE and 20.5% improvement over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing computer vision methods for flood detection suffer from accuracy limitations and poor generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific training.

Method: Combines GPT-4o's semantic reasoning with a structured knowledge graph encoding canonical dimensions of urban objects. Dynamically identifies reference objects, retrieves verified heights, estimates submergence ratios, and applies statistical outlier filtering.

Result: Achieves mean absolute error of 8.17 cm on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, reducing GPT-4o baseline error by 20.5% and surpassing prior CNN-based methods.

Conclusion: The system generalizes well across varying scenes, operates in near real-time, and is suitable for integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart city flood resilience.

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

TL;DR: Proposes PIG, a hybrid framework for text-to-video retrieval that combines advantages of both Two-Tower and Single-Tower approaches, achieving high effectiveness and efficiency through pseudo-query generation and fine-grained interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based approaches for text-to-video retrieval face trade-offs: Two-Tower framework has low effectiveness while Single-Tower framework suffers from low efficiency. There's a need for a solution that achieves both high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously.

Method: Proposes a Hybrid-Tower framework called PIG (Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation) that generates pseudo-queries for each video, enabling fine-grained interaction between video features and textual features before receiving real queries, while maintaining Two-Tower efficiency during inference.

Result: Achieves significant improvement over baselines with 1.6% to 3.9% increase in R@1 across five text-video retrieval benchmarks. Matches Two-Tower efficiency while achieving near state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The Hybrid-Tower framework successfully hybridizes the advantages of both Two-Tower and Single-Tower approaches, demonstrating that high effectiveness and efficiency can be achieved simultaneously in text-to-video retrieval tasks.

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Result: SuperGlue consistently yielded the lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods like SIFT and AKAZE performed well near equator but degraded under polar lighting conditions.

Conclusion: Results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions and sensor modalities.

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based models, especially Swin Transformer, outperform CNNs for mobile-acquired skin disease classification across 50+ disease categories, with Grad-CAM providing interpretable predictions for real-world applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin disease diagnosis is costly and complex in low-resource settings, and existing automated methods are limited to dermoscopic datasets with narrow disease ranges, creating a need for more accessible and comprehensive solutions.

Method: Curated a large dataset of 50+ skin disease categories captured with mobile devices, evaluated multiple CNN and Transformer architectures, and incorporated Grad-CAM for interpretability and clinical relevance.

Result: Transformer models, particularly Swin Transformer, achieved superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual features, demonstrating better classification accuracy than CNN approaches.

Conclusion: Transformer-based approaches show strong potential for mobile skin lesion classification, enabling accessible AI-assisted dermatological screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological
screening and early diagnosis in resource-limited environments.

### [115] [Extracting Uncertainty Estimates from Mixtures of Experts for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04816)
*Svetlana Pavlitska,Beyza Keskin,Alwin Faßbender,Christian Hubschneider,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mixture of Experts (MoE) provides well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates for semantic segmentation without architectural changes, outperforming ensemble methods especially on out-of-distribution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance reliability of computer vision models in safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception by improving uncertainty estimation accuracy and calibration.

Method: Used MoE with gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions, evaluated three uncertainty extraction methods (predictive entropy, mutual information, expert variance) on A2D2 dataset with semantic split, and tested routing uncertainty via gate entropy.

Result: MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in conditional correctness metrics under OOD data. Simple gating mechanisms provide better calibration than complex classwise gates. Increasing number of experts further enhances uncertainty calibration.

Conclusion: MoEs offer an efficient and effective alternative to ensembles for uncertainty quantification in semantic segmentation, with potential for improved reliability in safety-critical vision applications.

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

*Haosong Liu,Xiancheng Zhu,Huanqiang Zeng,Jianqing Zhu,Jiuwen Cao,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LFMT, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework with Subspace Simple Scanning strategy for efficient light field image super-resolution, achieving state-of-the-art performance with low computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Mamba-based methods for light field super-resolution suffer from inefficient and redundant feature extraction due to multi-directional scanning strategies when applied to complex LF data.

Method: Introduces Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy and Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) for efficient feature extraction. Uses dual-stage modeling: Stage I with Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block for shallow features, Stage II with dual-branch parallel structure combining Epipolar Plane Mamba Block and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block for deep epipolar refinement.

Result: LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in light field super-resolution, achieving substantial performance improvements while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-world and synthetic LF datasets.

Conclusion: The hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework effectively integrates strengths of both models for comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains, demonstrating superior performance in LFSR tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

*Ming Dai,Wenxuan Cheng,Jiedong Zhuang,Jiang-jiang Liu,Hongshen Zhao,Zhenhua Feng,Wankou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PropVG is an end-to-end proposal-based visual grounding framework that integrates foreground object proposal generation with referential object comprehension, using contrastive learning and multi-granularity discrimination to improve object identification in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end visual grounding methods rely only on referred targets for supervision and lack multi-granularity discrimination, limiting their robustness in complex scenarios. The authors aim to address these limitations by leveraging prominent prospective targets and incorporating multi-level discrimination.

Method: Proposed PropVG framework with two key modules: 1) Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module using contrastive learning at sentence and word levels, and 2) Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and semantic-level information. The framework integrates proposal generation with referential comprehension without additional detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including gRefCOCO, Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG, showing improved performance in visual grounding tasks.

Conclusion: PropVG successfully addresses limitations of existing visual grounding methods by integrating proposal generation with referential comprehension and incorporating multi-granularity discrimination through contrastive learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and
models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/PropVG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TemporalFlowViz is a visual analytics system that uses AI to analyze and interpret complex temporal flow field data from scramjet combustion simulations, enabling expert-driven clustering, visualization, and natural language summarization of combustion dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The large scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data from scramjet engines present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature differentiation, and cross-case comparison, making it difficult to understand complex combustion dynamics.

Method: The approach uses pretrained Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from time-sequenced flow field images, applies dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent combustion modes, constructs temporal trajectories, and uses vision-language models with expert annotations to generate natural-language summaries.

Result: The system effectively supports expert-driven analysis through parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration, enhancing hypothesis generation, interpretable pattern discovery, and knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Conclusion: TemporalFlowViz successfully bridges the gap between latent AI representations and expert reasoning, providing a powerful workflow for analyzing complex combustion dynamics in scramjet engines through integrated visual analytics and AI techniques.

Abstract: Understanding the complex combustion dynamics within scramjet engines is
critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniFHT is a pose-free 3D refractive index reconstruction framework for flow cytometry that handles arbitrary cell geometries and complex rotations without requiring known poses, enabling high-throughput label-free imaging of entire cell populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D quantitative phase imaging methods assume uniform single-axis rotation and require known cell poses, which restricts analysis to near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells with complex rotations, limiting statistical analysis capabilities.

Method: Leverages Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural representations (INRs) to jointly optimize each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric structure under weak scattering assumptions, supporting arbitrary geometries and multi-axis rotations.

Result: Produces high-fidelity 3D reconstructions with as few as 10 views or only 120 degrees of angular range, enabling accurate imaging from sparsely sampled projections and restricted angular coverage.

Conclusion: OmniFHT enables in situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations for the first time, providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis in flow cytometry platforms.

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS accelerates 3D reconstruction by focusing on points of interest with semantic Gaussian Splatting and color-based filtering, reducing training time by 25% while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile robotics for critical applications like tele-guidance and disaster response require both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast processing. Instead of reconstructing entire scenes, focusing on specific objects (points of interest) is more efficient.

Method: Proposes CoRe-GS which first generates a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic Gaussian Splatting, then refines it using novel color-based effective filtering for object isolation.

Result: Reduces training time by about 25% compared to full semantic GS training cycle. Evaluated on SCRREAM (real-world outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic indoor) datasets, showing reduced runtime and higher novel-view-synthesis quality.

Conclusion: CoRe-GS effectively balances high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time by leveraging semantic information and early object detection, making it suitable for time-critical mobile robotics applications.

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cryo-RL uses reinforcement learning to automate cryoablation probe placement for prostate cancer treatment, achieving performance comparable to human experts with significantly faster planning times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cryoablation planning is manual, expertise-dependent, time-consuming, and leads to variability in treatment quality, limiting scalability of this minimally invasive prostate cancer treatment.

Method: Reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process, where an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters in a simulated environment with clinical constraints.

Result: Achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared to best automated baselines, matched human expert performance, and required substantially less planning time on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning shows potential to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans, addressing current limitations in manual planning approaches.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable adaptive computerized exposure therapy systems that can dynamically adjust visual stimuli based on patient fear responses, by investigating whether computer vision models can accurately predict fear levels from images.

Method: Adapted three diverse pretrained computer vision models using transfer learning to predict human fear ratings (0-100 scale) from 313 spider images, evaluated with cross-validation, learning curve analysis, and explainability assessments.

Result: Models achieved average MAE between 10.1-11.0, performance degraded significantly with smaller datasets but plateaued with larger ones, predictions were based on spider-related features, with higher errors for distant views and artificial spiders.

Conclusion: Computer vision models show promise for predicting fear ratings in therapeutic applications, with both model explainability and sufficient dataset size being critical factors for developing effective emotion-aware technologies.

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

TL;DR: Simple attention-based MIL framework for automated sebocyte lipid droplet counting shows baseline MLP outperforms attention-MIL in stability, suggesting bag-level aggregation works better than complex attention mechanisms for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual counting of lipid droplets in sebocyte cells is labor-intensive and subjective, requiring automated solutions for accurate quantification in sebocyte biology research.

Method: Used Nile Red-stained sebocyte images annotated into 14 droplet count classes, expanded to ~50k cells via augmentation. Benchmarked baseline MLP with aggregated patch counts against attention-based MIL using ResNet-50 features with instance weighting, evaluated via 5-fold cross-validation.

Result: Baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6) compared to attention-based MIL (mean MAE = 10.7), though attention-MIL occasionally performed better in specific folds.

Conclusion: Simple bag-level aggregation provides robust baseline for slide-level droplet counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and regularization to reach its full potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

TL;DR: UniView is a novel view synthesis model that uses reference images from similar objects to provide strong priors, addressing ambiguity issues in single-image view synthesis through a retrieval system, MLLM-assisted selection, and multi-level feature integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-image novel view synthesis is highly ill-posed due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Current methods often generate severe distortions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input views.

Method: Proposes UniView with: 1) retrieval and augmentation system with MLLM-assisted reference image selection, 2) plug-and-play adapter with multi-level isolation layers for dynamic reference feature generation, 3) decoupled triple attention mechanism to preserve original image details and align multi-branch features.

Result: Extensive experiments show UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets.

Conclusion: Leveraging reference images from similar objects provides strong prior information that effectively addresses the ambiguity problem in single-image view synthesis, leading to superior performance with reduced distortions.

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper uses dual visual encoders and GPT-2 to efficiently map video features to audio generation, achieving better performance with only 16% of previous training scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training Video-to-Audio models from scratch is resource-intensive, so leveraging foundation models for cross-modal knowledge transfer is more efficient. Previous approaches used lightweight mappers but lacked rich semantic and temporal information.

Method: Introduces MFM-Mapper that fuses features from dual visual encoders and replaces linear mapper with GPT-2 for better feature alignment, treating cross-modal mapping as autoregressive translation.

Result: Achieves remarkable training efficiency with only 16% of previous training scale while maintaining competitive performance. Shows improved semantic and temporal consistency.

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper demonstrates that fusing multiple foundation model features and using GPT-2 for mapping significantly improves training efficiency and performance in video-to-audio generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

### [127] [Dual-Domain Perspective on Degradation-Aware Fusion: A VLM-Guided Robust Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05000)
*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GD^2Fusion is a novel infrared-visible image fusion framework that handles dual-source degraded scenarios by integrating vision-language models for degradation perception with dual-domain frequency/spatial joint optimization, eliminating the need for separate pre-enhancement steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IVIF methods assume high-quality inputs and struggle with degraded scenarios, requiring manual pre-enhancement steps that lead to error accumulation and performance degradation.

Method: Uses Guided Frequency Modality-Specific Extraction (GFMSE) for frequency-domain degradation perception/suppression and Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) for cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive feature aggregation in spatial domain.

Result: Extensive experiments show GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared to existing algorithms in dual-source degraded scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework synergistically integrates VLMs with dual-domain optimization to overcome limitations of traditional decoupled approaches, providing better handling of degraded image fusion scenarios.

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of deploying high-performing, interpretable AI systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection, supporting integration of AI diagnostic tools into clinical workflows.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest
accuracy (99.7%) and perfect sensitivity for malignant lesions. Classical ML
models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,
interpretable systems for ultrasound-based breast cancer detection.

*Hulin Li,Qiliang Ren,Jun Li,Hanbing Wei,Zheng Liu,Linfang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dark-traffic, the largest annotated dataset for low-light traffic scenes, and proposes SLVM - a biologically inspired vision model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing perception models struggle with low-light traffic scenes due to severe illumination degradation and lack of reliable visual cues. There is also no large-scale benchmark specifically for low-light traffic environments.

Method: Proposes Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM) with four key components: light-adaptive pupillary mechanism, feature-level separable learning strategy, task-specific decoupled branches, and spatial misalignment-aware fusion module. Also introduces Dark-traffic dataset using physically grounded illumination degradation.

Result: SLVM outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2% in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1% in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On LIS benchmark, it surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by average 11 percentage points.

Conclusion: The proposed SLVM framework and Dark-traffic dataset effectively address low-light traffic perception challenges, achieving superior performance with reduced computational requirements compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Motivation: Address computational requirements and dataset scarcity challenges in Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR) by leveraging transfer learning with lightweight mobile networks.

Method: Evaluated three transfer learning strategies (full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, training from scratch) using four mobile networks (MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, ShuffleNet) on three benchmark datasets (AHCD, HIJJA, IFHCDB).

Result: MobileNet achieved superior accuracy, robustness and efficiency. IFHCDB dataset yielded 99% accuracy with MnasNet, AHCD achieved 97% with ShuffleNet, HIJJA peaked at 92% with ShuffleNet. Full fine-tuning performed best overall.

Conclusion: Combining transfer learning with mobile networks enables resource-efficient AHCR. Future work will explore architectural modifications, dataset analysis, data augmentation, and sensitivity analysis for improved robustness.

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with
mobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic
Handwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive
computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from
scratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and
ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will

TL;DR: LUIVITON is an automated virtual try-on system that drapes multi-layer clothing onto diverse humanoid characters using SMPL as proxy representation and combines geometric learning with diffusion models for correspondence tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of aligning complex garments with arbitrary body shapes and diverse humanoid characters for fully automated virtual try-on without manual intervention.

Method: Uses SMPL as proxy representation, separates into clothing-to-SMPL (geometric learning-based approach) and body-to-SMPL (diffusion model with multi-view consistent appearance features) correspondence tasks.

Result: Handles complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, generalizes to various humanoid characters (humans, robots, cartoon, creatures, aliens), maintains computational efficiency, and supports clothing size/material customization.

Conclusion: Produces high-quality 3D clothing fittings automatically without human labor or 2D sewing patterns, enabling practical adoption for diverse virtual try-on applications.

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADClick is an interactive image segmentation tool that generates pixel-level anomaly annotations from minimal user clicks and text descriptions, improving anomaly detection performance without extensive manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial anomaly detection typically requires pixel-level annotations of defective samples, which is time-consuming and limits scalability. The goal is to enable efficient labeling using minimal user interaction.

Method: Proposes ADClick (Interactive Image Segmentation algorithm) that uses few user clicks and brief textual descriptions to generate precise anomaly annotations. Also introduces ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features with textual prompts using prototype-based approach.

Result: Achieves AP = 96.1% on MVTec AD with ADClick, and state-of-the-art results with ADClick-Seg: AP = 80.0%, PRO = 97.5%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1% on multi-class AD task.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient pixel-level annotation for industrial anomaly detection, significantly improving model performance while reducing labeling effort through interactive segmentation and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

TL;DR: AI-driven deep learning methods, particularly generative models, show promise for detecting and correcting MRI motion artifacts but face challenges with generalizability, paired data requirements, and potential visual distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically review and assess the effectiveness of AI methods for addressing MRI motion artifacts, which degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy in medical imaging.

Method: Comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis focusing on deep learning approaches, particularly generative models, with quantitative data extraction on datasets, architectures, and performance metrics.

Result: Deep learning generative models demonstrate potential for reducing motion artifacts and improving MRI image quality, but face limitations in generalizability, require paired training data, and may introduce visual distortions.

Conclusion: AI-driven methods show significant potential for MRI quality improvement but require standardized datasets, reporting protocols, and more advanced DL techniques to reduce reliance on paired data and enhance diagnostic accuracy and patient care.

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

*Yangming Li,Chaoyu Liu,Lihao Liu,Simon Masnou,Carola-Bibian Schönlieb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoSplat introduces a geometry-constrained optimization framework for Gaussian splatting that uses both first-order and second-order geometric priors to improve training pipeline including initialization, gradient updates, and densification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous works only used low-order geometric priors (like normal vectors) that were unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, limiting the performance of Gaussian splatting optimization.

Method: Proposes GeoSplat framework that uses principal curvatures for Gaussian initialization, introduces efficient noise-robust estimation methods for geometric structures, and incorporates both first-order and second-order geometric quantities throughout the training process.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis show that GeoSplat significantly improves Gaussian splatting performance and outperforms previous baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed geometry-constrained optimization framework with robust geometric priors effectively enhances Gaussian splatting training and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a hybrid CNN-Transformer model for facial beauty prediction that captures multi-scale features and their interactions, achieving state-of-the-art results on SCUT-FBP5500 dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs process information at fixed scales and may overlook inter-dependencies between features at different granularity levels, limiting performance in facial beauty prediction which requires understanding complex local and global feature relationships.

Method: Uses multi-scale parallel convolutions to capture facial features at varying receptive fields, then frames these representations as sequences processed by a Transformer encoder with self-attention to explicitly model interactions between multi-scale visual cues.

Result: Achieves Pearson Correlation of 0.9187 on SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art performance and outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling interplay between multi-scale visual cues is crucial for high-performance facial beauty prediction, and hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures show strong potential for complex image regression tasks requiring holistic, context-aware understanding.

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using sparse mixture-of-experts layers in CNNs improves adversarial robustness without increasing inference cost, with individual experts sometimes outperforming the full MoE model due to specialized robust subpaths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance CNN robustness against adversarial attacks without resource-intensive countermeasures by leveraging sparse MoE layers to increase model capacity efficiently.

Method: Replace selected residual blocks or convolutional layers with sparse MoE layers in ResNet architectures on CIFAR-100, combined with adversarial training and switch loss for balancing.

Result: Single MoE layer insertion in deeper stages consistently improves robustness under PGD and AutoPGD attacks. Switch loss causes routing collapse onto few experts, concentrating adversarial training and creating specialized robust subpaths.

Conclusion: Sparse MoE layers effectively boost adversarial robustness, and the observed expert specialization suggests potential for identifying and leveraging naturally robust model components.

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

*Mainak Biswas,Ambedkar Dukkipati,Devarajan Sridharan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAFT is a source-free semi-supervised domain adaptation method for regression tasks that improves model performance when source data is unavailable and labeled target data is scarce, achieving up to 9% RMSE improvement over fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications like medicine face challenges where source models don't generalize to domain-shifted target data, source data cannot be shared due to privacy/constraints, and labeled target data is limited - particularly problematic for continuous-valued outputs in neuroscience settings.

Method: Builds upon Contradistinguisher framework but adapts it for source-free semi-supervised transfer in regression tasks. Uses a regularization approach that learns shared models across labeled source and unlabeled target samples without intermediate representation alignment.

Result: CRAFT achieved up to 9% RMSE improvement over fine-tuned models when labeled training examples were scarce, outperformed four state-of-the-art source-free DA models by more than 3%, and demonstrated efficacy in neuroscience (EEG gaze prediction, MRI brain age prediction) and other real-world regression benchmarks.

Conclusion: CRAFT provides an efficient approach for source-free semi-supervised deep transfer for regression tasks, which is particularly valuable in biology and medicine where privacy constraints and data limitations are common.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

TL;DR: A transformer-based framework that generates high-fidelity 3D textures from a single image and mesh in 0.2 seconds, eliminating UV mapping and differentiable rendering while outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing texture generation methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain faithful to reference images, creating challenges for realistic 3D content creation.

Method: Uses transformer-based framework with triplane representation and depth-based backprojection losses to predict 3D texture field directly from single image and mesh, enabling efficient training and fast inference.

Result: Generates high-fidelity textures in single forward pass (0.2s per shape), outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity to input image and perceptual quality through extensive evaluations.

Conclusion: The method provides practical solution for scalable, high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation by eliminating traditional bottlenecks like UV mapping and slow rendering processes.

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

*Chaolei Wang,Yang Luo,Jing Du,Siyu Chen,Yiping Chen,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGS-3D is a training-free refinement method that improves 3D instance segmentation by splitting ambiguous 2D-to-3D lifted masks using geometric primitives and then growing them into complete instances, achieving better accuracy across diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D instance segmentation methods based on 2D-to-3D lifting struggle with precise instance-level segmentation due to accumulated errors from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints during the lifting process.

Method: A "split-then-grow" framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric primitives, then grows them into complete instances. Uses mask filtering with 3D geometry primitives to remove ambiguous masks and exploits spatial continuity with high-level features for geometric refinement.

Result: Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 show substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness against inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, with strong generalization across indoor and outdoor environments.

Conclusion: SGS-3D effectively addresses the limitations of 2D-to-3D lifting approaches by jointly fusing semantic and geometric information, enabling high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation without requiring additional training.

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

### [140] [SL-SLR: Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Sign Language Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05188)
*Ariel Basso Madjoukeng,Jérôme Fink,Pierre Poitier,Edith Belise Kenmogne,Benoit Frenay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised learning framework for sign language recognition that addresses issues with contrastive learning by using free-negative pairs and a new data augmentation technique to improve feature discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning methods in sign language recognition treat all video parts equally and struggle with similar negative pairs due to shared movements between signs, leading to non-discriminative features.

Method: Proposes a self-supervised framework with two key components: (1) a new self-supervised approach using free-negative pairs, and (2) a novel data augmentation technique designed to work together.

Result: Shows considerable accuracy gains compared to several contrastive and self-supervised methods across linear evaluation, semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of traditional contrastive learning in SLR by learning more meaningful and discriminative representations for sign recognition.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

*Yamei Chen,Haoquan Zhang,Yangyi Huang,Zeju Qiu,Kaipeng Zhang,Yandong Wen,Weiyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with generating precise symbolic graphics programs (SVGs) from text descriptions. A new benchmark shows proprietary models outperform open-source ones, but reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards can bridge this gap by improving SVG quality and semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' capability in generating precise symbolic graphics programs (SVGs) from natural language descriptions, and to understand how LLMs comprehend the visual world through program synthesis.

Method: Introduced SGP-GenBench benchmark covering object/scene fidelity and compositionality. Proposed reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards using format-validity gates and cross-modal alignment via vision encoders (SigLIP for text-image, DINO for image-image).

Result: Frontier proprietary models significantly outperform open-source models on SVG generation. The RL approach applied to Qwen-2.5-7B substantially improved SVG quality and semantics, achieving performance comparable to frontier systems. RL induced finer object decomposition and better scene coherence.

Conclusion: Symbolic graphics programming provides a precise and interpretable framework for studying cross-modal grounding in LLMs, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards effectively bridges the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

Result: Creates millions of unique task rules across difficulty levels, with baseline experiments showing state-of-the-art vision models consistently fail to generalize to novel combinations despite strong in-domain performance.

Conclusion: COGITAO provides an open-source benchmark that reveals significant gaps in current AI systems' compositional reasoning abilities, enabling continued research in this critical area.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

TL;DR: GetNetUPAM is a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework for evaluating underwater acoustic monitoring models under realistic environmental variability, paired with ARPA-N neural architecture that achieves significant performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring faces challenges with noise, signal dependencies, and environmental variability that hinder model stability and generalization across different sites and time periods.

Method: Proposes GetNetUPAM framework with site-year blocking for realistic evaluation, and ARPA-N neural network with adaptive pooling and spatial attention for handling irregular spectrogram dimensions and capturing global context.

Result: ARPA-N achieves 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet baselines and order-of-magnitude reduction in variability across metrics, enabling consistent detection across diverse environmental conditions.

Conclusion: The combined framework enables scalable and accurate bioacoustic monitoring by addressing ecological variability through rigorous evaluation and adaptive neural architecture design.

Abstract: Underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (UPAM) provides rich spatiotemporal
data for long-term ecological analysis, but intrinsic noise and complex signal
dependencies hinder model stability and generalization. Multilayered windowing
has improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient
noise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic
sources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce
GetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to
quantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are
partitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording
heterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental
subset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year
blocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while
standard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across
UPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks.
Using GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution
Pooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular
spectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the
receptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under
GetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet
baselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all
metrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing
scalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities across various vision-language tasks. However, their
reasoning abilities in the multimodal symbolic music domain remain largely
unexplored. We introduce WildScore, the first in-the-wild multimodal symbolic
music reasoning and analysis benchmark, designed to evaluate MLLMs' capacity to
interpret real-world music scores and answer complex musicological queries.
Each instance in WildScore is sourced from genuine musical compositions and
accompanied by authentic user-generated questions and discussions, capturing
the intricacies of practical music analysis. To facilitate systematic
evaluation, we propose a systematic taxonomy, comprising both high-level and
fine-grained musicological ontologies. Furthermore, we frame complex music
reasoning as multiple-choice question answering, enabling controlled and
scalable assessment of MLLMs' symbolic music understanding. Empirical
benchmarking of state-of-the-art MLLMs on WildScore reveals intriguing patterns
in their visual-symbolic reasoning, uncovering both promising directions and

*Han Liang,Jiahui Zhou,Zicheng Zhou,Xiaoxi Zhang,Xu Chen*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: STADI is a novel framework that accelerates diffusion model inference in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments through spatio-temporal adaptive parallelism, reducing latency by up to 45% compared to state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion parallelism inference schemes underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause workload imbalance, leading to inefficient inference.

Method: STADI uses a hybrid scheduler with computation-aware step allocator (temporal dimension) and elastic patch parallelism mechanism (spatial dimension). The temporal component reduces denoising steps on slower GPUs using least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization, while the spatial component allocates variably sized image patches according to GPU computational capability.

Result: Extensive experiments show STADI significantly improves load balancing and mitigates performance bottlenecks, reducing end-to-end inference latency by up to 45% compared to patch parallelism while significantly improving resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.

Conclusion: STADI effectively addresses workload imbalance in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments through its spatio-temporal adaptive approach, demonstrating substantial performance improvements for diffusion model inference.

Abstract: The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image
generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their
substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism
inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU
environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause
workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion
Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in
such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained
parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI
introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup
phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to
reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further
minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism
mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to
their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through
a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both
load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,
demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance
bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion
inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference
latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on
heterogeneous GPUs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser is a novel end-to-end framework that improves GUI perception by using continuous coordinate modeling instead of discrete text-based methods, achieving higher accuracy and faster inference while enabling full interface parsing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs for GUI perception have limitations including lower grounding accuracy, slower inference due to discrete coordinate modeling, and inability to parse entire interfaces, which restricts broad application and downstream task support.

Method: Uses continuous coordinate modeling with a pre-trained MLLM, adding a token router and coordinate decoder. Includes a rejection mechanism based on modified Hungarian matching to identify non-existent elements and reduce false positives.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent outperformance of SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks, demonstrating improved accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser successfully addresses limitations of prior methods by enabling simultaneous higher localization precision and fine-grained parsing of entire interfaces through continuous coordinate modeling and robust rejection mechanisms.

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the sim-to-real gap and enable convenient creation of realistic 3D simulations for applications in embodied AI, autonomous driving, and entertainment by automating the traditionally manual 3D environment production process.

Method: Proposes LatticeWorld framework that combines lightweight large language models (LLaMA-2-7B) with industry-grade rendering engines (Unreal Engine 5) to generate dynamic 3D environments from textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal inputs.

Result: Achieves superior accuracy in scene layout generation and visual fidelity, with over 90x increase in industrial production efficiency compared to traditional manual methods while maintaining high creative quality.

Conclusion: LatticeWorld demonstrates an effective approach to streamline 3D world generation, offering significant efficiency improvements and high-quality results for creating interactive virtual environments with dynamic agents and realistic physics simulation.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Maestro is a holistic LLM agent optimizer that jointly searches over agent graphs and configurations using reflective textual feedback, outperforming existing prompt optimizers while being more sample-efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agent optimizers only tune configurations while keeping the graph structure fixed, leaving structural failure modes unaddressed. There's a need for a holistic approach that optimizes both graph structure and node configurations.

Method: Maestro performs joint search over agent graphs (module connections) and configurations (models, prompts, tools). It uses reflective textual feedback from execution traces to prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure modes under explicit rollout/token budgets.

Result: On IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro outperforms MIPROv2 by 12%, GEPA by 4.9%, and GEPA+Merge by 4.86% on average. Even for prompt-only optimization, it leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41% respectively. Achieves results with fewer rollouts than GEPA and shows large gains on interviewer & RAG applications.

Conclusion: Joint graph and configuration search effectively addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning alone cannot fix, demonstrating the importance of holistic optimization for building reliable LLM agents.

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

TL;DR: The paper argues for developing explicit hierarchical World Models using LLMs to generate structured scaffolds, enabling more efficient multi-agent learning in complex tasks like robotic soccer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agents fail in complex multi-agent tasks due to intractable exploration spaces and sparse rewards in flat simulators. The development of sophisticated explicit World Models is identified as a key bottleneck.

Method: Proposes hierarchical scaffolding where complex goals are decomposed into manageable subgoals, leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this hierarchical structure and create language-configurable task layers.

Result: Analysis of 2024 multi-agent soccer research shows a clear trend toward integrating symbolic/hierarchical methods with MARL, demonstrating the effectiveness of task-based world models in guiding agent learning.

Conclusion: Language-driven world models provide intrinsic curriculum, dense learning signals, and compositional learning framework, enabling agents to acquire sophisticated strategic behaviors with greater sample efficiency and bridging low-level reactive behaviors with high-level team strategy.

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure predictable and user-personalized responses from LLMs by addressing the challenge of controllability in conversational agents, particularly for qualitative features like language proficiency.

Method: Develop quantitative definitions for qualitative conversational concepts using linguistic descriptors, formalize them in description logic, incorporate into an ontology, and use this to guide LLM fine-tuning for controlled text generation.

Result: Experimental results show consistent and explainable proficiency-level definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI systems.

Conclusion: The ontology-based framework successfully enables formal definition and control of conversational features, providing a structured approach for predictable and transparent LLM behavior in dialogue systems.

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

TL;DR: Sticker-TTS is a test-time scaling framework that coordinates three collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions using historical experience, achieving superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks under comparable inference budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current test-time scaling methods rely on redundant sampling and ignore historical experience utilization, limiting computational efficiency for large reasoning models.

Method: Proposes a framework with three collaborative LRMs that extract, refine, and reuse critical information (called 'stickers') across multiple reasoning rounds, using a two-stage optimization strategy combining imitation learning and self-improvement.

Result: Extensive evaluations on AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH benchmarks show Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines including self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches under comparable inference budgets.

Conclusion: The framework effectively utilizes sticker-guided historical experience, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and reasoning performance for large reasoning models.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are

Main category: cs.DS

TL;DR: Proposes a 'No-Data Algorithm' to establish trust in evaluators without labeled references by posing successive challenges, with formal proofs and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for establishing evaluator trustworthiness require labeled reference data or assumptions about evaluator knowledge, which are unavailable or unreliable when no development sets exist.

Method: Developed an algorithm that poses successive challenges to evaluators to test their trustworthiness without any existing labeled references, using formal verification methods.

Result: The algorithm successfully establishes trustworthiness with high probability - accepts knowledgeable evaluators and flags untrustworthy ones, validated through formal proofs and empirical tests including LLM judges on low-resource languages.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for evaluating trust in labelers when reference data is unavailable, with applications in low-resource scenarios and LLM-based evaluation systems.

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure
its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are
either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to
label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are
unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data,
and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an
algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator
without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing
challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish
trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows
the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and,
conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it.
We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to
LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior tools for proving program divergence only worked on small benchmarks (tens to hundreds of lines of code), making them impractical for real-world codebases that can contain tens to hundreds of millions of lines of code.

Method: Pulse Infinite uses proof techniques that work compositionally (for scalability) and under-approximately (to ensure soundness for proving divergence). It analyzes programs written in C, C++, and Hack.

Result: The tool was applied to over 100 million lines of open-source and proprietary software, identifying over 30 previously unknown divergence issues.

Conclusion: Pulse Infinite establishes a new state of the art for detecting divergence in real-world codebases, demonstrating practical scalability for large industrial codebases.

Abstract: We report on our tool, Pulse Infinite, that uses proof techniques to show
non-termination (divergence) in large programs. Pulse Infinite works
compositionally and under-approximately: the former supports scale, and the
latter ensures soundness for proving divergence. Prior work focused on small
benchmarks in the tens or hundreds of lines of code (LoC), and scale limits
their practicality: a single company may have tens of millions, or even

TL;DR: Using LLMs to generate synthetic code review training data by translating changes from well-resourced languages to underrepresented languages, enabling effective review classification in low-resource settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the bottleneck of insufficient labelled data for training supervised models in new programming languages and frameworks, where large volumes of unlabelled code exist but labelled examples are scarce.

Method: Leverage LLMs to translate code changes from well-resourced languages into equivalent changes in underrepresented languages, then train supervised classifiers on the synthetic data and compare performance against models trained on real labelled data.

Result: Experiments across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs show that LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation systems, narrowing the performance gap in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: This approach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks without requiring annotated data.

Abstract: Automating the decision of whether a code change requires manual review is
vital for maintaining software quality in modern development workflows.
However, the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks creates a
critical bottleneck: while large volumes of unlabelled code are readily
available, there is an insufficient amount of labelled data to train supervised
models for review classification. We address this challenge by leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages
into equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating
synthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that
although LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from
available unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are
considered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To
overcome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train
supervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of
these classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments
across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that
LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation
systems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This
approach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review
capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of
annotated data.

*Haruo Fujiwara,Yusuke Mukuta,Tatsuya Harada*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel method for high-quality 3D scene stylization that ensures view consistency and enables region-controlled style transfer using reference-based attention mechanisms and multi-region loss functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-driven 3D scene editing methods struggle with maintaining both high-quality stylization and view consistency simultaneously, and lack the ability to apply styles consistently to different regions with semantic correspondence.

Method: Re-trains initial 3D representation using stylized multi-view 2D images, extends style-aligned depth-conditioned view generation with single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism, uses grid of multiple depth maps for view consistency, and proposes Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced Wasserstein Distance Loss for region-controlled style transfer.

Result: The pipeline effectively improves text-driven 3D stylization results, achieving both style consistency and view consistency across different viewpoints while enabling optional region-specific style application.

Conclusion: The proposed techniques successfully address the limitations of existing 3D stylization methods by ensuring high-quality results with view consistency and providing flexible region-controlled style transfer capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which
leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated
promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality
stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style
consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic
correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we
introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while
maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style
transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D
representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.
Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized
multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned
depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared
attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,
which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,
inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth
maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among
stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced
Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image
regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that
this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables
the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene.
Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that
our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.

Motivation: To bridge the gap between narrative text generation and playable visual environments in procedural content generation, enabling story-driven scene creation.

Method: Extracts three key time frames from LLM narratives, identifies Object-Relation-Object triples, retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings, generates terrain with Cellular Automata, and places objects using spatial rules.

Result: Evaluated on ten diverse stories with analysis of tile-object matching, affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable approach for narrative-driven scene generation and establishes foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity and story-centered PCG.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models(LLMs) enable compelling story
generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments
remains an open challenge in procedural content generation(PCG). We present a
lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of
2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given
an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames,
extracts spatial predicates in the form of "Object-Relation-Object" triples,
and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the
GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata,
and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure.
We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching,
affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.
This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation
and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic
tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need reliable topological localization to perform tasks, but visual localization faces challenges from perceptual ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations in office environments.

Method: Evaluated state-of-the-art visual descriptors including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches with systematic comparison of features, distance measures, and classifiers using standard evaluation metrics.

Result: Demonstrated advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity measures, and classifiers, validated through the Robot Vision task of ImageCLEF evaluation campaign.

Conclusion: Future work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature combinations to build more robust real-time localization systems that handle varied illumination and longer routes while reducing computational complexity.

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since
robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks.
Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual
ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses
topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired
with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on
temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual
descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and
Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions
include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance
measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation
metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate
the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity
measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further
validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where
the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future
work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature
combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and
runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims
toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer
routes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deictic gestures like pointing are fundamental for non-verbal communication in human-robot interaction, enabling robots to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate responses for intuitive collaboration.

Method: Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer (MM-ITF) architecture that maps 2D pointing gestures to object locations using inter-modality attention, assigns likelihood scores to each object, and identifies the most likely target in tabletop scenarios with the NICOL robot.

Result: The method accurately predicts intended objects using monocular RGB data and introduces a patch confusion matrix for performance evaluation across candidate object locations.

Conclusion: MM-ITF enables intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration by effectively interpreting natural pointing gestures to identify target objects in controlled tabletop environments.

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal
communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or
locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where
robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate
responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer
(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop
scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural
pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing
gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and
identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can
accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling
intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the
performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the
model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional MPC assumes zero-mean Gaussian noise, but deep learning-based perception modules produce biased, heavy-tailed non-Gaussian uncertainties that require accurate quantification for safe control.

Method: Uses set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased uncertainties, reformulates robust MPC as linear program with Minkowski-Lyapunov cost, ensures stability through contractive zonotopic invariant sets and ellipsoidal approximations.

Result: The framework provides stable and accurate control under heavy-tailed noise, significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based approaches in both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

Conclusion: The perception-aware MPC successfully addresses non-Gaussian noise from deep learning perception, offering improved robustness and performance compared to conventional methods, validated through simulations and hardware experiments.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that
explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based
perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate
uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe
feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of
zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs
set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,
heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To
improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear
program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added
slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is
ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic
invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding
feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the
zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and
hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and
a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a
ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides
stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,
significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms
of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable privacy-preserving real-time speech communication by developing a streaming model that can anonymize speaker identity while maintaining low latency and acceptable speech intelligibility.

Method: Uses causal waveform encoder with short lookahead buffer, transformer-based contextual layers, direct waveform generation via neural vocoder (bypassing mel-spectrogram conversion), and injects GAN-generated pseudo-speaker embeddings into linguistic features.

Result: Achieves near-chance performance (50% EER) in speaker verification on lazy-informed attack scenario while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within 9%).

Conclusion: DarkStream provides a practical solution for real-time speech anonymization by balancing low-latency, robust privacy protection, and minimal intelligibility degradation.

Abstract: We propose DarkStream, a streaming speech synthesis model for real-time
speaker anonymization. To improve content encoding under strict latency
constraints, DarkStream combines a causal waveform encoder, a short lookahead
buffer, and transformer-based contextual layers. To further reduce inference
time, the model generates waveforms directly via a neural vocoder, thus
removing intermediate mel-spectrogram conversions. Finally, DarkStream
anonymizes speaker identity by injecting a GAN-generated pseudo-speaker
embedding into linguistic features from the content encoder. Evaluations show
our model achieves strong anonymization, yielding close to 50% speaker
verification EER (near-chance performance) on the lazy-informed attack
scenario, while maintaining acceptable linguistic intelligibility (WER within
9%). By balancing low-latency, robust privacy, and minimal intelligibility
degradation, DarkStream provides a practical solution for privacy-preserving

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con framework introduces alternative statistical divergences and similarity kernels to address limitations of KL divergence in representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KL divergence used in existing representation learning methods has limitations including asymmetry, unboundedness, and potential misalignment with true objectives, prompting exploration of alternative divergences.

Method: Systematic framework that replaces KL divergence with alternative statistical divergences (total variation distance, bounded f-divergences) and explores different similarity kernels (distance-based instead of angular kernels).

Result: Achieved SOTA on unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, outperformed standard supervised contrastive learning, and obtained superior dimensionality reduction results compared to SNE.

Conclusion: Choice of divergence and similarity kernel significantly impacts representation learning optimization, with alternative divergences offering better performance than traditional KL-based approaches.

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

### [168] [Inferring the Graph Structure of Images for Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04677)
*Mayur S Gowda,John Shi,Augusto Santos,José M. F. Moura*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Alternative graph representations for MNIST/Fashion-MNIST images using correlation-based methods improve GNN accuracy over traditional grid graphs and superpixel approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional grid graph representations of images may not be optimal for GNN performance. The paper aims to find better graph structures that capture more meaningful relationships between pixels to improve downstream GNN task accuracy.

Method: Develop alternative graph representations using row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs based on correlations between pixel values in MNIST and Fashion-MNIST images, building on previous correlation-based graph construction methods.

Result: Experiments show that using these correlation-based graph representations as input to GNN models (Graph CNNs, GAT, GatedGCN) improves classification accuracy compared to traditional grid graphs and superpixel methods.

Conclusion: Correlation-based graph construction methods provide superior representations for image datasets in GNN applications, demonstrating that alternative graph structures can significantly enhance model performance over conventional approaches.

Abstract: Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural
Network (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid
graph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring
pixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values
(intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input
to graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph
CNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the
images. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural
network tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel
methods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We
find row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in
MNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on
the method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph
representations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the
accuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the
literature.

### [169] [AURAD: Anatomy-Pathology Unified Radiology Synthesis with Progressive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04819)
*Shuhan Ding,Jingjing Fu,Yu Gu,Naiteek Sangani,Mu Wei,Paul Vozila,Nan Liu,Jiang Bian,Hoifung Poon*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AURAD is a controllable chest X-ray synthesis framework that generates both images and pseudo semantic masks from clinical prompts, ensuring anatomical-pathological consistency and clinical relevance through expert model filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image synthesis faces challenges with fine-grained control and clinical relevance in chest radiographs due to diverse disease patterns, limited annotations, and domain shifts across datasets.

Method: Progressive pipeline that first generates pseudo masks from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, then uses these masks to guide image synthesis, with pretrained medical models filtering outputs for clinical plausibility.

Result: 78% of synthesized images classified as authentic by radiologists, over 40% of segmentation overlays rated clinically useful, demonstrating effectiveness across tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: AURAD bridges generative modeling with clinical applications by producing both realistic images and usable segmentation masks, with code and models to be released for broader impact.

Abstract: Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting
datasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings.
However, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to
limited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing
methods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to
generalize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically
diverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these
challenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that
jointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike
prior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity,
controllability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks
that capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological
consistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first
generated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then
used to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical
models to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual
realism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such
as detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and
real-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method
across tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are
classified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of
predicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code,
pre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon
publication.

### [170] [Multi-modal Uncertainty Robust Tree Cover Segmentation For High-Resolution Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04870)
*Yuanyuan Gui,Wei Li,Yinjian Wang,Xiang-Gen Xia,Mauro Marty,Christian Ginzler,Zuyuan Wang*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MURTreeFormer is a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that addresses temporal misalignment issues in remote sensing by modeling uncertainty and reconstructing auxiliary features for robust tree cover mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-modal remote sensing data (optical, LiDAR, SAR) are often acquired at different times, causing temporal misalignments that introduce cross-modal uncertainty and degrade segmentation accuracy for tree cover mapping applications.

Method: Proposes MURTreeFormer framework that treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, models patch-level uncertainty via probabilistic latent representation, uses VAE-based resampling to reconstruct uncertain patches, and integrates gradient magnitude attention and refinement head modules.

Result: Extensive experiments on Shanghai and Zurich datasets show MURTreeFormer significantly improves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates cross-modal uncertainty caused by temporal misalignments in multi-modal remote sensing data, providing robust tree cover mapping with enhanced segmentation accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing images
have significantly improved the accuracy of tree cover mapping, supporting
applications in urban planning, forest monitoring, and ecological assessment.
Integrating data from multiple modalities-such as optical imagery, light
detection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-has shown
superior performance over single-modality methods. However, these data are
often acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may
occur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and
variations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce
cross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can
severely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose
MURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and
leverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer
treats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling
patch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent
representation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the
primary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism,
producing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient
magnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are
further integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal
datasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly
improves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of
temporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.

### [171] [VLSM-Ensemble: Ensembling CLIP-based Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05154)
*Julia Dietlmeier,Oluwabukola Grace Adegboro,Vayangi Ganepola,Claudia Mazo,Noel E. O'Connor*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Ensembling vision-language segmentation models with a low-complexity CNN improves performance, achieving up to 6.3% Dice score improvement on medical imaging datasets compared to CLIP/BiomedCLIP baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models for image segmentation show promise but implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP underperform compared to more sophisticated architectures like CRIS. The authors aim to narrow this performance gap through ensembling rather than text prompt engineering.

Method: Ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN architecture to combine the strengths of both approaches for improved segmentation performance.

Result: Achieved significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on BKAI polyp dataset using ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, with gains ranging from 1% to 6% across other datasets. Results vary across different radiology and non-radiology datasets.

Conclusion: Ensembling works differently across datasets (sometimes outperforming, sometimes underperforming CRIS model), indicating this approach requires further investigation by the community. The method shows promise for improving vision-language segmentation performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks
present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable
results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still
lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work,
instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to
narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models
(VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice
score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled
BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%.
Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and
non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across
these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model),
indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is
available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.

### [172] [Histogram Driven Amplitude Embedding for Qubit Efficient Quantum Image Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04849)
*Sahil Tomar,Sandeep Kumar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: A quantum image compression method using fixed-size blocks and amplitude embedding that maintains constant qubit requirements independent of image resolution, achieving high-quality reconstructions with only 5-7 qubits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a hardware-efficient quantum image compression method suitable for near-term quantum devices (NISQ era) that overcomes the limitations of conventional pixel-level encodings which require qubits proportional to image resolution.

Method: Segments images into fixed-size blocks (bixels), computes total intensity per block, constructs global histogram with B bins, encodes normalized square roots of bin counts as amplitudes into n-qubit quantum state using PennyLane, executes on IBM Quantum hardware, and measures to reconstruct histogram for image recovery.

Result: Achieves high-quality image reconstructions using only 5-7 qubits, significantly outperforming conventional pixel-level encodings in qubit efficiency while maintaining constant qubit requirements based on histogram bins rather than image resolution.

Conclusion: The method provides a practical and efficient quantum image compression approach for current NISQ systems, allowing users to control fidelity-resource trade-offs through bin count adjustment and demonstrating the viability of quantum computing for image processing applications.

Abstract: This work introduces a compact and hardware efficient method for compressing
color images using near term quantum devices. The approach segments the image
into fixed size blocks called bixels, and computes the total intensity within
each block. A global histogram with B bins is then constructed from these block
intensities, and the normalized square roots of the bin counts are encoded as
amplitudes into an n qubit quantum state. Amplitude embedding is performed
using PennyLane and executed on real IBM Quantum hardware. The resulting state
is measured to reconstruct the histogram, enabling approximate recovery of
block intensities and full image reassembly. The method maintains a constant
qubit requirement based solely on the number of histogram bins, independent of
the resolution of the image. By adjusting B, users can control the trade off
between fidelity and resource usage. Empirical results demonstrate high quality
reconstructions using as few as 5 to 7 qubits, significantly outperforming
conventional pixel level encodings in terms of qubit efficiency and validating
the practical application of the method for current NISQ era quantum systems.
