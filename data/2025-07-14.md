### [1] [RepeaTTS: Towards Feature Discovery through Repeated Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08012)
*Atli Sigurgeirsson,Simon King*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model is enhanced to improve controllability by analyzing latent features from synthesized samples and incorporating them as labels for fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The model's flexibility leads to uncontrollable variations, and its controllability is limited to features exposed during training. Addressing these issues improves user control over speech attributes.

Method: Principal component analysis identifies latent features from synthesized samples, which are then used as labels for secondary fine-tuning. Evaluated on Icelandic speech models with and without emotional disclosure.

Result: For the model without emotional disclosure, the method improves controllability by introducing continuous and discrete features.

Conclusion: The novel fine-tuning regime effectively addresses the model's limitations, enhancing controllability without compromising flexibility.

Abstract: A Prompt-based Text-To-Speech model allows a user to control different
aspects of speech, such as speaking rate and perceived gender, through natural
language instruction. Although user-friendly, such approaches are on one hand
constrained: control is limited to acoustic features exposed to the model
during training, and too flexible on the other: the same inputs yields
uncontrollable variation that are reflected in the corpus statistics.
  We investigate a novel fine-tuning regime to address both of these issues at
the same time by exploiting the uncontrollable variance of the model. Through
principal component analysis of thousands of synthesised samples, we determine
latent features that account for the highest proportion of the output variance
and incorporate them as new labels for secondary fine-tuning. We evaluate the
proposed methods on two models trained on an expressive Icelandic speech
corpus, one with emotional disclosure and one without. In the case of the model
without emotional disclosure, the method yields both continuous and discrete
features that improve overall controllability of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MedicalBERT, a BERT-based model pretrained on biomedical data, outperforms existing models in biomedical NLP tasks by leveraging domain-specific vocabulary and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose NLP models like BERT struggle with biomedical terminology, necessitating a domain-specific solution.

Method: Developed MedicalBERT by pretraining BERT on a large biomedical dataset and fine-tuning it for tasks like named entity recognition and question answering.

Result: MedicalBERT surpasses BioBERT, SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT, outperforming general BERT by 5.67% on average.

Conclusion: MedicalBERT demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific pretraining and transfer learning for biomedical NLP.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) have been driven
bypretrained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, T5, and GPT. Thesemodels excel
at understanding complex texts, but biomedical literature, withits
domain-specific terminology, poses challenges that models likeWord2Vec and
bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) can't fullyaddress. GPT and T5,
despite capturing context, fall short in tasks needingbidirectional
understanding, unlike BERT. Addressing this, we proposedMedicalBERT, a
pretrained BERT model trained on a large biomedicaldataset and equipped with
domain-specific vocabulary that enhances thecomprehension of biomedical
terminology. MedicalBERT model is furtheroptimized and fine-tuned to address
diverse tasks, including named entityrecognition, relation extraction, question
answering, sentence similarity, anddocument classification. Performance metrics
such as the F1-score,accuracy, and Pearson correlation are employed to showcase
the efficiencyof our model in comparison to other BERT-based models such as
BioBERT,SciBERT, and ClinicalBERT. MedicalBERT outperforms these models onmost
of the benchmarks, and surpasses the general-purpose BERT model by5.67% on
average across all the tasks evaluated respectively. This work alsounderscores
the potential of leveraging pretrained BERT models for medicalNLP tasks,
demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques incapturing
domain-specific information.

### [3] [Mass-Scale Analysis of In-the-Wild Conversations Reveals Complexity Bounds on LLM Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08014)
*Aldan Creo,Raul Castro Fernandez,Manuel Cebrian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes jailbreak complexity in LLMs across 2M+ real-world conversations, finding no significant difference in complexity between jailbreak attempts and normal conversations. Safety mechanisms are improving, and complexity has natural limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI safety as LLMs are increasingly deployed.

Method: Mass-scale empirical analysis using complexity metrics (probabilistic measures, lexical diversity, compression ratios, cognitive load) across diverse platforms.

Result: Jailbreak attempts are not more complex than normal conversations; assistant response toxicity has decreased, indicating better safety. Complexity distributions show natural limits.

Conclusion: The study challenges the arms race narrative, suggesting LLM safety is bounded by human ingenuity. It warns of information hazards in disclosing sophisticated jailbreaks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.

### [4] [Assessing the Capabilities and Limitations of FinGPT Model in Financial NLP Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08015)
*Prudence Djagba,Chimezie A. Odinakachukwu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model, excels in structured tasks like sentiment analysis but struggles with reasoning and generation tasks, lagging behind GPT-4 and human benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in real-world financial applications across six NLP tasks.

Method: Evaluation using finance-specific datasets for tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and stock movement prediction.

Result: Strong performance in classification tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis) but weaker in reasoning/generation tasks (e.g., question answering).

Conclusion: FinGPT is effective for structured financial tasks but requires architectural improvements for broader applicability.

Abstract: This work evaluates FinGPT, a financial domain-specific language model,
across six key natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Sentiment Analysis,
Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition, Financial Question Answering,
Text Summarization, and Stock Movement Prediction. The evaluation uses
finance-specific datasets to assess FinGPT's capabilities and limitations in
real-world financial applications. The results show that FinGPT performs
strongly in classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and headline
categorization, often achieving results comparable to GPT-4. However, its
performance is significantly lower in tasks that involve reasoning and
generation, such as financial question answering and summarization. Comparisons
with GPT-4 and human benchmarks highlight notable performance gaps,
particularly in numerical accuracy and complex reasoning. Overall, the findings
indicate that while FinGPT is effective for certain structured financial tasks,
it is not yet a comprehensive solution. This research provides a useful
benchmark for future research and underscores the need for architectural
improvements and domain-specific optimization in financial language models.

### [5] [Mechanistic Indicators of Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08017)
*Pierre Beckmann,Matthieu Queloz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper synthesizes findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI) to argue that LLMs develop internal structures functionally analogous to understanding, proposing a three-tiered framework for machine understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the view that LLMs rely solely on superficial statistics and to introduce a theoretical framework for machine understanding.

Method: Proposes a three-tiered conception of machine understanding: conceptual, state-of-the-world, and principled understanding, based on internal model structures.

Result: LLMs exhibit forms of understanding through internal structures, though their cognitive architecture differs from humans.

Conclusion: The debate should shift from whether LLMs understand to exploring how their unique cognitive mechanisms operate.

Abstract: Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the
inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these
models rely solely on superficial statistics. Here, we offer an accessible
synthesis of these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI, all while
integrating these findings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking
about machine understanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures
that are functionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in
seeing connections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception
of machine understanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model
forms "features" as directions in latent space, thereby learning the
connections between diverse manifestations of something. Second,
state-of-the-world understanding emerges when a model learns contingent factual
connections between features and dynamically tracks changes in the world.
Third, principled understanding emerges when a model ceases to rely on a
collection of memorized facts and discovers a "circuit" that connects these
facts. However, we conclude by exploring the "parallel mechanisms" phenomenon,
arguing that while LLMs exhibit forms of understanding, their cognitive
architecture remains different from ours, and the debate should shift from
whether LLMs understand to how their strange minds work.

### [6] [Review, Remask, Refine (R3): Process-Guided Block Diffusion for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08018)
*Nikita Mounier,Parsa Idehpour*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3 (Review, Remask, Refine) is a framework for iterative text generation that uses a Process Reward Model (PRM) to identify and correct errors without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of enabling models to efficiently identify and correct their own errors in iterative text generation.

Method: R3 employs a PRM to review intermediate blocks, remasks low-scoring blocks, and refines targeted segments.

Result: The framework improves final output by focusing on sub-optimal parts of past generations.

Conclusion: R3 is a simple yet effective approach for enhancing text generation without extra training.

Abstract: A key challenge for iterative text generation is enabling models to
efficiently identify and correct their own errors. We propose Review, Remask,
Refine (R3), a relatively simple yet elegant framework that requires no
additional model training and can be applied to any pre-trained masked text
diffusion model (e.g., LLaDA or BD3-LM). In R3, a Process Reward Model (PRM) is
utilized for the Review of intermediate generated blocks. The framework then
translates these PRM scores into a Remask strategy: the lower a block's PRM
score, indicating potential mistakes, the greater the proportion of tokens
within that block are remasked. Finally, the model is compelled to Refine these
targeted segments, focusing its efforts more intensively on specific
sub-optimal parts of past generations, leading to improved final output.

### [7] [Signal or Noise? Evaluating Large Language Models in Resume Screening Across Contextual Variations and Human Expert Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08019)
*Aryan Varshney,Venkat Ram Reddy Ganuthula*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study examines if LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini) show consistent or random behavior in resume screening, comparing their performance to human experts. Results show significant differences between LLMs and humans, with GPT adapting best to context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs provide reliable and consistent evaluations in resume screening compared to human experts, and how their behavior varies with context.

Method: Tested three LLMs with controlled datasets across different contexts (No Company, Firm1, Firm2, Reduced Context) and benchmarked against human experts using ANOVA and paired t-tests.

Result: LLMs showed significant differences in performance compared to humans, with GPT adapting strongly to company context, Gemini partially, and Claude minimally. Meta-cognition analysis revealed distinct weighting patterns from humans.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit interpretable patterns with detailed prompts but diverge significantly from human judgment, impacting their use in automated hiring systems.

Abstract: This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit
consistent behavior (signal) or random variation (noise) when screening resumes
against job descriptions, and how their performance compares to human experts.
Using controlled datasets, we tested three LLMs (Claude, GPT, and Gemini)
across contexts (No Company, Firm1 [MNC], Firm2 [Startup], Reduced Context)
with identical and randomized resumes, benchmarked against three human
recruitment experts. Analysis of variance revealed significant mean differences
in four of eight LLM-only conditions and consistently significant differences
between LLM and human evaluations (p < 0.01). Paired t-tests showed GPT adapts
strongly to company context (p < 0.001), Gemini partially (p = 0.038 for
Firm1), and Claude minimally (p > 0.1), while all LLMs differed significantly
from human experts across contexts. Meta-cognition analysis highlighted
adaptive weighting patterns that differ markedly from human evaluation
approaches. Findings suggest LLMs offer interpretable patterns with detailed
prompts but diverge substantially from human judgment, informing their
deployment in automated hiring systems.

### [8] [Circumventing Safety Alignment in Large Language Models Through Embedding Space Toxicity Attenuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08020)
*Zhibo Zhang,Yuxi Li,Kailong Wang,Shuai Yuan,Ling Shi,Haoyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ETTA is a framework that manipulates LLM embeddings to bypass safety mechanisms, achieving high attack success rates without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM safety alignments are vulnerable to embedding-level attacks, which are not well-studied.

Method: ETTA uses linear transformations to identify and attenuate toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embeddings.

Result: ETTA achieves an 88.61% attack success rate, outperforming baselines by 11.34%, and works on safety-enhanced models.

Conclusion: The study reveals a critical vulnerability in LLM safety alignments, calling for embedding-aware defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.

### [9] [Unveiling Effective In-Context Configurations for Image Captioning: An External & Internal Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08021)
*Li Li,Yongliang Wu,Jingze Zhu,Jiawei Peng,Jianfei Cai,Xu Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores multimodal in-context learning (ICL) in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), focusing on demonstration configuration strategies and controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) for image captioning. It combines external experiments (shot number, image retrieval, caption assignment) and internal analysis (attention characteristics) to understand LMM behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the preliminary exploration of demonstration configuration in multimodal ICL and leverage ICE controllability to analyze LMM inference characteristics.

Method: Comprehensive external (demonstration configuration strategies) and internal (attention analysis) investigations on image captioning, using multiple metrics and auxiliary experiments.

Result: Reveals how ICE configuration impacts performance and identifies typical LMM attention patterns. Proposes attention-based metrics and explores model acceleration/compression feasibility.

Conclusion: Provides dual perspectives (external and internal) for understanding multimodal ICL in LMMs, with broader applicability of the proposed metrics and analysis method.

Abstract: The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context
Learning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous
studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of
Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration
configuration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the
controllability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and
cost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of
LMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and
internal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image
captioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies
through three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.
We employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and
summarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention
characteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model
behaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of
attention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare
performance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining
strategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data
features. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model
performance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns
through internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding
multimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis
to investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be
applied to broader research areas.

### [10] ["Amazing, They All Lean Left" -- Analyzing the Political Temperaments of Current LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08027)
*W. Russell Neuman,Chad Coleman,Ali Dasdan,Safinah Ali,Manan Shah,Kund Meghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates the liberal orientation of seven major LLMs, attributing it to training data, RLHF, academic discourse, and safety practices, and distinguishes bias from epistemic differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the causes and implications of the consistent liberal-leaning responses in commercial LLMs.

Method: Systematic analysis using Moral Foundations Theory, political ideology scales, and a new index of political controversies.

Result: Most models prioritize liberal values like care and fairness, influenced by training corpora, RLHF, and fine-tuning.

Conclusion: The liberal tilt is an emergent property of training on democratic discourse, not bias, and may reflect Rawlsian ideals.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a consistent liberal orientation in the ethical
and political responses generated by most commercial large language models
(LLMs), yet the underlying causes and resulting implications remain unclear.
This paper systematically investigates the political temperament of seven
prominent LLMs - OpenAI's GPT-4o, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4, Perplexity
(Sonar Large), Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash, Meta AI's Llama 4, Mistral 7b Le Chat
and High-Flyer's DeepSeek R1 -- using a multi-pronged approach that includes
Moral Foundations Theory, a dozen established political ideology scales and a
new index of current political controversies. We find strong and consistent
prioritization of liberal-leaning values, particularly care and fairness,
across most models. Further analysis attributes this trend to four overlapping
factors: Liberal-leaning training corpora, reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), the dominance of liberal frameworks in academic ethical
discourse and safety-driven fine-tuning practices. We also distinguish between
political "bias" and legitimate epistemic differences, cautioning against
conflating the two. A comparison of base and fine-tuned model pairs reveals
that fine-tuning generally increases liberal lean, an effect confirmed through
both self-report and empirical testing. We argue that this "liberal tilt" is
not a programming error or the personal preference of programmers but an
emergent property of training on democratic rights-focused discourse. Finally,
we propose that LLMs may indirectly echo John Rawls' famous veil-of ignorance
philosophical aspiration, reflecting a moral stance unanchored to personal
identity or interest. Rather than undermining democratic discourse, this
pattern may offer a new lens through which to examine collective reasoning.

### [11] [Better Together: Quantifying the Benefits of AI-Assisted Recruitment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08029)
*Ada Aka,Emil Palikot,Ali Ansari,Nima Yazdani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI-assisted recruitment improves hiring efficiency and candidate selection, with a 20% higher pass rate in final interviews and a 5.9% higher job placement rate compared to traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the impact of AI on recruitment efficiency and candidate selection, given limited empirical evidence.

Method: Random assignment of 37,000 applicants to either traditional or AI-assisted recruitment, with final human interviews blind to the selection method.

Result: AI pipeline had a 54% pass rate vs. 34% in traditional, and 23% job placement vs. 18%. AI favored younger, less experienced candidates.

Conclusion: AI enhances recruitment but may introduce biases, highlighting the need for careful implementation and further research.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in recruitment, yet
empirical evidence quantifying its impact on hiring efficiency and candidate
selection remains limited. We randomly assign 37,000 applicants for a
junior-developer position to either a traditional recruitment process (resume
screening followed by human selection) or an AI-assisted recruitment pipeline
incorporating an initial AI-driven structured video interview before human
evaluation. Candidates advancing from either track faced the same final-stage
human interview, with interviewers blind to the earlier selection method. In
the AI-assisted pipeline, 54% of candidates passed the final interview compared
with 34% from the traditional pipeline, yielding an average treatment effect of
20 percentage points (SE 12 pp.). Five months later, we collected LinkedIn
profiles of top applicants from both groups and found that 18% (SE 1.1%) of
applicants from the traditional track found new jobs compared with 23% (SE
2.3%) from the AI group, resulting in a 5.9 pp. (SE 2.6 pp.) difference in the
probability of finding new employment between groups. The AI system tended to
select younger applicants with less experience and fewer advanced credentials.
We analyze AI-generated interview transcripts to examine the selection criteria
and conversational dynamics. Our findings contribute to understanding how AI
technologies affect decision making in recruitment and talent acquisition while
highlighting some of their potential implications.

### [12] [A Systematic Analysis of Declining Medical Safety Messaging in Generative AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08030)
*Sonali Sharma,Ahmed M. Alaa,Roxana Daneshjou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The study found a significant decline in medical disclaimers in LLM and VLM outputs from 2022 to 2025, highlighting the need for safeguards as models become more authoritative.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the presence of medical disclaimers in AI-generated outputs for medical applications, given their critical role in ensuring user safety.

Method: Analyzed 500 mammograms, 500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions for disclaimer phrases across LLM and VLM outputs from 2022 to 2025.

Result: Disclaimer presence dropped sharply: from 26.3% (2022) to 0.97% (2025) for LLMs, and from 19.6% (2023) to 1.05% (2025) for VLMs.

Conclusion: As AI models grow more capable, implementing context-aware disclaimers is essential to maintain safety in clinical applications.

Abstract: Generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used to interpret medical
images and answer clinical questions. Their responses often include
inaccuracies; therefore, safety measures like medical disclaimers are critical
to remind users that AI outputs are not professionally vetted or a substitute
for medical advice. This study evaluated the presence of disclaimers in LLM and
VLM outputs across model generations from 2022 to 2025. Using 500 mammograms,
500 chest X-rays, 500 dermatology images, and 500 medical questions, outputs
were screened for disclaimer phrases. Medical disclaimer presence in LLM and
VLM outputs dropped from 26.3% in 2022 to 0.97% in 2025, and from 19.6% in 2023
to 1.05% in 2025, respectively. By 2025, the majority of models displayed no
disclaimers. As public models become more capable and authoritative,
disclaimers must be implemented as a safeguard adapting to the clinical context
of each output.

### [13] [Beyond Scale: Small Language Models are Comparable to GPT-4 in Mental Health Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08031)
*Hong Jia,Shiya Fu,Vassilis Kostakos,Feng Xia,Ting Dang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLMs perform close to LLMs in mental health tasks, especially in binary classification, with few-shot learning boosting their performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if SLMs can match LLMs in mental health understanding, offering privacy-preserving alternatives for sensitive applications.

Method: Benchmarked five SLMs against three LLMs using zero-shot and few-shot learning on six mental health tasks.

Result: SLMs achieved mean performance within 2% of LLMs in binary classification, with few-shot learning improving SLMs by up to 14.6%.

Conclusion: SLMs are viable privacy-preserving tools for mental health screening, adapting well with minimal data.

Abstract: The emergence of Small Language Models (SLMs) as privacy-preserving
alternatives for sensitive applications raises a fundamental question about
their inherent understanding capabilities compared to Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper investigates the mental health understanding capabilities of
current SLMs through systematic evaluation across diverse classification tasks.
Employing zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms, we benchmark their
performance against established LLM baselines to elucidate their relative
strengths and limitations in this critical domain. We assess five
state-of-the-art SLMs (Phi-3, Phi-3.5, Qwen2.5, Llama-3.2, Gemma2) against
three LLMs (GPT-4, FLAN-T5-XXL, Alpaca-7B) on six mental health understanding
tasks. Our findings reveal that SLMs achieve mean performance within 2\% of
LLMs on binary classification tasks (F1 scores of 0.64 vs 0.66 in zero-shot
settings), demonstrating notable competence despite orders of magnitude fewer
parameters. Both model categories experience similar degradation on multi-class
severity tasks (a drop of over 30\%), suggesting that nuanced clinical
understanding challenges transcend model scale. Few-shot prompting provides
substantial improvements for SLMs (up to 14.6\%), while LLM gains are more
variable. Our work highlights the potential of SLMs in mental health
understanding, showing they can be effective privacy-preserving tools for
analyzing sensitive online text data. In particular, their ability to quickly
adapt and specialize with minimal data through few-shot learning positions them
as promising candidates for scalable mental health screening tools.

### [14] [Integrating External Tools with Large Language Models to Improve Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08034)
*Nripesh Niketan,Hadj Batatia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework, Athena, to enhance LLMs by integrating external tools for better query responses in educational settings, achieving superior accuracy over state-of-the-art models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often provide poor or hallucinated responses without contextual data. Integrating external tools can improve accuracy and functionality.

Method: Developed a framework to access external APIs for additional data and computational tools (e.g., calculators, calendars). Evaluated using MMLU datasets for mathematical and scientific reasoning.

Result: Athena achieved 83% accuracy in math and 88% in science, outperforming models like GPT-4o and LLaMA-Large.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for creating ecosystems around LLMs to enhance their utility in diverse tasks.

Abstract: This paper deals with improving querying large language models (LLMs). It is
well-known that without relevant contextual information, LLMs can provide poor
quality responses or tend to hallucinate. Several initiatives have proposed
integrating LLMs with external tools to provide them with up-to-date data to
improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose a framework to integrate external
tools to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in answering queries in educational
settings. Precisely, we develop a framework that allows accessing external APIs
to request additional relevant information. Integrated tools can also provide
computational capabilities such as calculators or calendars. The proposed
framework has been evaluated using datasets from the Multi-Modal Language
Understanding (MMLU) collection. The data consists of questions on mathematical
and scientific reasoning. Results compared to state-of-the-art language models
show that the proposed approach significantly improves performance. Our Athena
framework achieves 83% accuracy in mathematical reasoning and 88% in scientific
reasoning, substantially outperforming all tested models including GPT-4o,
LLaMA-Large, Mistral-Large, Phi-Large, and GPT-3.5, with the best baseline
model (LLaMA-Large) achieving only 67% and 79% respectively. These promising
results open the way to creating complex computing ecosystems around LLMs to
make their use more natural to support various tasks and activities.

TL;DR: This study reviews MedVQA's clinical utility, revealing gaps like non-diagnostic QA pairs, lack of EHR integration, and misaligned evaluation metrics. Clinicians highlight the need for patient history, multi-view imaging, and interactive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess MedVQA's practical integration into clinical workflows by identifying gaps and clinician perspectives.

Method: A scoping review of 68 publications (2018-2024) and a survey of 50 clinicians from India and Thailand.

Result: 60% of QA pairs lack clinical relevance; clinicians find current MedVQA systems limited (29.8% highly useful). Key gaps include missing patient history, multi-view imaging, and interactive dialogue.

Conclusion: MedVQA has potential but requires addressing multimodal analysis, patient context, and evaluation alignment for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) is a promising tool to assist
radiologists by automating medical image interpretation through question
answering. Despite advances in models and datasets, MedVQA's integration into
clinical workflows remains limited. This study systematically reviews 68
publications (2018-2024) and surveys 50 clinicians from India and Thailand to
examine MedVQA's practical utility, challenges, and gaps. Following the Arksey
and O'Malley scoping review framework, we used a two-pronged approach: (1)
reviewing studies to identify key concepts, advancements, and research gaps in
radiology workflows, and (2) surveying clinicians to capture their perspectives
on MedVQA's clinical relevance. Our review reveals that nearly 60% of QA pairs
are non-diagnostic and lack clinical relevance. Most datasets and models do not
support multi-view, multi-resolution imaging, EHR integration, or domain
knowledge, features essential for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, there is a
clear mismatch between current evaluation metrics and clinical needs. The
clinician survey confirms this disconnect: only 29.8% consider MedVQA systems
highly useful. Key concerns include the absence of patient history or domain
knowledge (87.2%), preference for manually curated datasets (51.1%), and the
need for multi-view image support (78.7%). Additionally, 66% favor models
focused on specific anatomical regions, and 89.4% prefer dialogue-based
interactive systems. While MedVQA shows strong potential, challenges such as
limited multimodal analysis, lack of patient context, and misaligned evaluation
approaches must be addressed for effective clinical integration.

*Matan Vetzler,Koren Lazar,Guy Uziel,Eran Hirsch,Ateret Anaby-Tavor,Leshem Choshen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CRISP introduces a dataset for high-level plans in reasoning tasks, showing fine-tuned small models outperform large models and CoT reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods like CoT and few-shot prompting for LLMs lack sufficient reasoning capabilities for complex tasks.

Method: CRISP dataset is created with validated high-level plans for math and code tasks. A small model is fine-tuned on CRISP.

Result: Fine-tuned small models generate better plans than large models and outperform CoT reasoning, with cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: CRISP demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-tuning for high-level planning, improving reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
stronger reasoning capabilities to solve complex problems effectively. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been a step forward, it remains
insufficient for many domains. A promising alternative is explicit high-level
plan generation, but existing approaches largely assume that LLMs can produce
effective plans through few-shot prompting alone, without additional training.
In this work, we challenge this assumption and introduce CRISP (Complex
Reasoning with Interpretable Step-based Plans), a multi-domain dataset of
high-level plans for mathematical reasoning and code generation. The plans in
CRISP are automatically generated and rigorously validated--both intrinsically,
using an LLM as a judge, and extrinsically, by evaluating their impact on
downstream task performance. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a small model on
CRISP enables it to generate higher-quality plans than much larger models using
few-shot prompting, while significantly outperforming Chain-of-Thought
reasoning. Furthermore, our out-of-domain evaluation reveals that fine-tuning
on one domain improves plan generation in the other, highlighting the
generalizability of learned planning capabilities.

*Talor Abramovich,Gal Chechik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AblationBench is a benchmark suite for evaluating AI agents on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research, featuring two tasks (AuthorAblation and ReviewerAblation) and LM-based judges for evaluation. Current LMs perform poorly, with chain-of-thought prompting outperforming agent-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support or automate parts of the research process, particularly ablation experiments, in empirical AI research using autonomous agents built on LMs.

Method: Introduces AblationBench with two tasks: AuthorAblation (83 instances) and ReviewerAblation (350 instances), using LM-based judges for automatic evaluation. Evaluates frontier LMs on these tasks.

Result: Best-performing LM system identifies only 29% of original ablations on average. Chain-of-thought prompting outperforms agent-based approaches.

Conclusion: Current LMs struggle with ablation planning tasks, but chain-of-thought prompting shows promise over existing agent-based methods.

Abstract: Autonomous agents built on language models (LMs) are showing increasing
popularity in many fields, including scientific research. AI co-scientists aim
to support or automate parts of the research process using these agents. A key
component of empirical AI research is the design of ablation experiments. To
this end, we introduce AblationBench, a benchmark suite for evaluating agents
on ablation planning tasks in empirical AI research. It includes two tasks:
AuthorAblation, which helps authors propose ablation experiments based on a
method section and contains 83 instances, and ReviewerAblation, which helps
reviewers find missing ablations in a full paper and contains 350 instances.
For both tasks, we develop LM-based judges that serve as an automatic
evaluation framework. Our experiments with frontier LMs show that these tasks
remain challenging, with the best-performing LM system identifying only 29% of
the original ablations on average. Lastly, we analyze the limitations of
current LMs on these tasks, and find that chain-of-thought prompting
outperforms the currently existing agent-based approach.

### [18] [Krul: Efficient State Restoration for Multi-turn Conversations with Dynamic Cross-layer KV Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08045)
*Junyi Wen,Junyuan Liang,Zicong Hong,Wuhui Chen,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Krul is a system for efficient KV cache restoration in multi-turn LLM conversations, dynamically selecting compression strategies to reduce overhead without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KV cache compression methods use fixed schemes, ignoring conversation-specific attention dynamics, leading to accuracy degradation.

Method: Krul dynamically selects compression strategies, uses a recomputation-loading pipeline, and introduces innovations like a preemptive selector, token-wise similarity estimator, and bubble-free scheduler.

Result: Krul reduces time-to-first-token by 1.5x-2.68x and KV cache storage by 1.33x-2.35x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Krul effectively balances efficiency and accuracy in multi-turn LLM conversations.

Abstract: Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language
models (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of
recomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To
address this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers
with highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a
fixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer
pairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention
dynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern
similarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable
accuracy degradation.
  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and
efficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies
based on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a
recomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key
innovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical
context for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the
conversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to
mitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model
generation; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles
brought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV
caches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul
achieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x
reduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without
compromising generation quality.

*Sebastian Walter,Hannah Bast*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A zero-shot approach using large language models to generate SPARQL queries from natural language for RDF knowledge graphs, achieving state-of-the-art results on Wikidata and competitive performance on Freebase.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient SPARQL query generation from natural language without fine-tuning, leveraging large language models for exploration and retrieval.

Method: Uses a language model to explore the knowledge graph by executing SPARQL queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals, evaluated across various benchmarks and models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on Wikidata, close to few-shot methods on Freebase, and performs well on less common benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach is effective for zero-shot SPARQL query generation, adaptable to diverse knowledge graphs, and benefits from additional strategies like feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: We propose a new approach for generating SPARQL queries on RDF knowledge
graphs from natural language questions or keyword queries, using a large
language model. Our approach does not require fine-tuning. Instead, it uses the
language model to explore the knowledge graph by strategically executing SPARQL
queries and searching for relevant IRIs and literals. We evaluate our approach
on a variety of benchmarks (for knowledge graphs of different kinds and sizes)
and language models (of different scales and types, commercial as well as
open-source) and compare it with existing approaches. On Wikidata we reach
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, despite the zero-shot setting.
On Freebase we come close to the best few-shot methods. On other, less commonly
evaluated knowledge graphs and benchmarks our approach also performs well
overall. We conduct several additional studies, like comparing different ways
of searching the graphs, incorporating a feedback mechanism, or making use of
few-shot examples.

*Reilly Raab,Mike Parker,Dan Nally,Sadie Montgomery,Anastasia Bernat,Sai Munikoti,Sameera Horawalavithana*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework for statically typed, LM-powered subroutines is proposed to responsibly leverage language models, ensuring transparency and auditability while minimizing risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about safety, explainability, and bias in LM adoption, enabling human experts to focus on decision-making rather than data-processing.

Method: Develop a framework for LM-powered subroutines with recorded artifacts for audit, implemented as a library. Evaluated in public comment processing (CommentNEPA).

Result: Quantitative evaluation shows the framework's effectiveness in compiling and summarizing public comments, compared to human-annotated ground-truth data.

Conclusion: The framework offers a responsible and transparent way to integrate LMs into real-world workflows, validated in environmental review contexts.

Abstract: The advent of language models (LMs) has the potential to dramatically
accelerate tasks that may be cast to text-processing; however, real-world
adoption is hindered by concerns regarding safety, explainability, and bias.
How can we responsibly leverage LMs in a transparent, auditable manner --
minimizing risk and allowing human experts to focus on informed decision-making
rather than data-processing or prompt engineering? In this work, we propose a
framework for declaring statically typed, LM-powered subroutines (i.e.,
callable, function-like procedures) for use within conventional asynchronous
code -- such that sparse feedback from human experts is used to improve the
performance of each subroutine online (i.e., during use). In our
implementation, all LM-produced artifacts (i.e., prompts, inputs, outputs, and
data-dependencies) are recorded and exposed to audit on demand. We package this
framework as a library to support its adoption and continued development. While
this framework may be applicable across several real-world decision workflows
(e.g., in healthcare and legal fields), we evaluate it in the context of public
comment processing as mandated by the 1969 National Environmental Protection
Act (NEPA): Specifically, we use this framework to develop "CommentNEPA," an
application that compiles, organizes, and summarizes a corpus of public
commentary submitted in response to a project requiring environmental review.
We quantitatively evaluate the application by comparing its outputs (when
operating without human feedback) to historical ``ground-truth'' data as
labelled by human annotators during the preparation of official environmental
impact statements.

### [21] [Compactor: Calibrated Query-Agnostic KV Cache Compression with Approximate Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143)
*Vivek Chari,Benjamin Van Durme*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Compactor is a query-agnostic KV cache compression method using leverage scores, reducing memory usage by up to 63% with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the high memory demands of KV caches in LLMs, which limit throughput and increase costs.

Method: Uses approximate leverage scores for token importance and introduces context-calibrated compression to infer optimal compression ratios.

Result: Achieves same performance as competitors while retaining half the tokens and reduces KV memory by 63% on Longbench.

Conclusion: Compactor is effective and generalizable across multiple tasks and model families, offering significant memory savings.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very
large context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in
generation is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,
which scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often
the dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput
and increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV
cache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked
(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present
Compactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses
approximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that
Compactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining
1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal
computational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated
compression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given
context can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that
Compactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV
memory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and
generalizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and
real-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5
and Llama 3.1 families.

*Henry J. Xie,Jinghan Zhang,Xinhao Zhang,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method to distill empathy from LLMs into SLMs using a two-step fine-tuning process and targeted prompts, achieving a 90% win rate in empathetic response generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure SLMs retain empathy from LLMs for use in resource-constrained, human-interactive domains like smartphones.

Method: A two-step fine-tuning process leveraging empathetic dialogue datasets and four unique prompt sets for targeted empathy improvement.

Result: SLMs achieved a 90% win rate in empathetic responses, with targeted prompts outperforming basic prompting by 10%.

Conclusion: The approach effectively distills empathy into SLMs, enhancing their performance in human interactions.

Abstract: The distillation of knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) into Smaller
Language Models (SLMs), preserving the capabilities and performance of LLMs
while reducing model size, has played a key role in the proliferation of LLMs.
Because SLMs are considerably smaller than LLMs, they are often utilized in
domains where human interaction is frequent but resources are highly
constrained, e.g., smart phones. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that
empathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled
into LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a
comprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.
Our approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages
datasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore
several distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four
unique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly
enhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs
fine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets
enhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform
the base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%. Our
targeted empathy improvement prompts substantially outperform the basic direct
prompting with a 10% improvement in win rate.

TL;DR: TruthTorchLM is an open-source Python library with over 30 truthfulness prediction methods for LLM outputs, offering broad compatibility and extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative LLMs often produce untruthful responses, necessitating accurate truthfulness prediction, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

Method: The library includes diverse truthfulness prediction methods, spanning computational cost, access level, grounding requirements, and supervision type, with compatibility for HuggingFace and LiteLLM.

Result: Evaluated on TriviaQA, GSM8K, and FactScore-Bio, TruthTorchLM provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation, calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction.

Conclusion: TruthTorchLM accelerates research and makes truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, offering a flexible framework for extension.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (LLMs)inevitably produce untruthful
responses. Accurately predicting the truthfulness of these outputs is critical,
especially in high-stakes settings. To accelerate research in this domain and
make truthfulness prediction methods more accessible, we introduce TruthTorchLM
an open-source, comprehensive Python library featuring over 30 truthfulness
prediction methods, which we refer to as Truth Methods. Unlike existing
toolkits such as Guardrails, which focus solely on document-grounded
verification, or LM-Polygraph, which is limited to uncertainty-based methods,
TruthTorchLM offers a broad and extensible collection of techniques. These
methods span diverse tradeoffs in computational cost, access level (e.g.,
black-box vs white-box), grounding document requirements, and supervision type
(self-supervised or supervised). TruthTorchLM is seamlessly compatible with
both HuggingFace and LiteLLM, enabling support for locally hosted and API-based
models. It also provides a unified interface for generation, evaluation,
calibration, and long-form truthfulness prediction, along with a flexible
framework for extending the library with new methods. We conduct an evaluation
of representative truth methods on three datasets, TriviaQA, GSM8K, and
FactScore-Bio. The code is available at https://github.com/Ybakman/TruthTorchLM

### [24] [Simple Mechanistic Explanations for Out-Of-Context Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08218)
*Atticus Wang,Joshua Engels,Oliver Clive-Griffin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned LLMs exhibit out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) due to LoRA fine-tuning adding a constant steering vector, improving generalization. Steering vectors can be trained from scratch, even for tasks like model backdoors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why fine-tuned LLMs show surprising out-of-distribution generalization (OOCR) and what mechanisms drive this capability.

Method: Mechanistically investigate OOCR, focusing on LoRA fine-tuning's role in adding steering vectors. Train steering vectors from scratch to test their impact.

Result: LoRA fine-tuning adds a constant steering vector, enabling OOCR. Steering vectors trained from scratch also induce OOCR, even for seemingly conditional tasks like model backdoors.

Conclusion: The study explains OOCR as a result of steering vectors learned during fine-tuning, shedding light on LLMs' advanced reasoning capabilities for safer deployment.

Abstract: Out-of-context reasoning (OOCR) is a phenomenon in which fine-tuned LLMs
exhibit surprisingly deep out-of-distribution generalization. Rather than
learning shallow heuristics, they implicitly internalize and act on the
consequences of observations scattered throughout the fine-tuning data. In this
work, we investigate this phenomenon mechanistically and find that many
instances of OOCR in the literature have a simple explanation: the LoRA
fine-tuning essentially adds a constant steering vector, steering the model
towards a general concept. This improves performance on the fine-tuning task
and in many other concept-related domains, causing the surprising
generalization. Moreover, we can directly train steering vectors for these
tasks from scratch, which also induces OOCR. We find that our results hold even
for a task that seems like it must involve conditional behavior (model
backdoors); it turns out that unconditionally adding a steering vector is
sufficient. Overall, our work presents one explanation of what gets learned
during fine-tuning for OOCR tasks, contributing to the key question of why LLMs
can reason out of context, an advanced capability that is highly relevant to
their safe and reliable deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs as proxy students in ITSs and test questions are evaluated for alignment with real students using NAEP data and IRT. Findings show strong models outperform average students, while weaker ones align incidentally. Grade-enforcement prompts affect performance but no model-prompt pair fits all cases, highlighting the need for better strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if LLMs accurately emulate real students in educational contexts, given their growing use in ITSs and test question piloting.

Method: Collected 489 NAEP items (math and reading, grades 4, 8, 12), applied IRT to compare 11 LLMs' abilities with real students.

Result: Strong LLMs outperform average students; weaker models align incidentally. Grade-enforcement prompts impact performance, but no model-prompt pair universally fits.

Conclusion: LLMs as proxies require careful selection and new strategies; guidelines are provided for viable proxy choices.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.

TL;DR: The study uses NLP and HAM-CNN to analyze gender differences in pain experiences, revealing linguistic and prevalence disparities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earlier research often ignored gender's role in pain experiences, prompting this study to explore gender-specific insights.

Method: Employed NLP and HAM-CNN to classify and analyze posts by gender, achieving an F1 score of 0.86.

Result: Found linguistic differences (e.g., female posts more emotional) and gender-specific pain condition prevalence (e.g., migraines in females).

Conclusion: Gender significantly influences pain experiences, with implications for tailored treatments and further research.

Abstract: Pain is an inherent part of human existence, manifesting as both physical and
emotional experiences, and can be categorized as either acute or chronic. Over
the years, extensive research has been conducted to understand the causes of
pain and explore potential treatments, with contributions from various
scientific disciplines. However, earlier studies often overlooked the role of
gender in pain experiences. In this study, we utilized Natural Language
Processing (NLP) to analyze and gain deeper insights into individuals' pain
experiences, with a particular focus on gender differences. We successfully
classified posts into male and female corpora using the Hidden Attribute
Model-Convolutional Neural Network (HAM-CNN), achieving an F1 score of 0.86 by
aggregating posts based on usernames. Our analysis revealed linguistic
differences between genders, with female posts tending to be more emotionally
focused. Additionally, the study highlighted that conditions such as migraine
and sinusitis are more prevalent among females and explored how pain medication
affects individuals differently based on gender.

TL;DR: Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT) is a 40B LLM addressing overthinking in reasoning tasks via dynamic mode-switching, efficient training, and reinforcement learning, outperforming SOTA models while reducing token usage by 30%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To solve the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks by dynamically switching between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.

Method: Uses a dual-regime dataset, MTP-enhanced knowledge distillation, cold-start initialization, and Step-SRPO reinforcement learning for mode selection and accuracy.

Result: KAT matches or outperforms SOTA models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1-0528, Qwen3-235B-A22B) while reducing token usage by ~30%.

Conclusion: KAT improves real-world workflows and shows scalability, with promising early results for a 200B MoE model.

Abstract: We present Kwaipilot-AutoThink (KAT), an open-source 40B large language model
developed to address the overthinking problem in reasoning-intensive tasks,
where an automatic thinking training paradigm is proposed to dynamically switch
between reasoning and non-reasoning modes based on task complexity.
Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel
tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling
efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost.
Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces
mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting.
Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that
incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering
structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT
consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models,
including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of
reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately
30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in
Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world
development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable
reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage
results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and
efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel fine-tuning paradigm, Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR), is introduced to enhance Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT) in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) without forgetting their existing OCR abilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel in OCR but struggle with DIMT due to cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Fine-tuning for DIMT often degrades OCR performance.

Method: SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before translation, leveraging its OCR strength while learning translation, inspired by "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage."

Result: SSR mitigates catastrophic forgetting, improving MLLMs' performance on both OCR and DIMT tasks.

Conclusion: SSR is an effective paradigm for enhancing DIMT in MLLMs while preserving their OCR capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in
document image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,
they struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires
handling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to
enhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT
dataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual
abilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
fine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR
proficiency, inspired by the concept "Bilingual Cognitive Advantage".
Specifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing
translation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR
ability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic
forgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT
tasks.

Conclusion: CRMAgent provides scalable, effective solutions for crafting persuasive CRM messages in e-commerce.

Abstract: In e-commerce private-domain channels such as instant messaging and e-mail,
merchants engage customers directly as part of their Customer Relationship
Management (CRM) programmes to drive retention and conversion. While a few top
performers excel at crafting outbound messages, most merchants struggle to
write persuasive copy because they lack both expertise and scalable tools. We
introduce CRMAgent, a multi-agent system built on large language models (LLMs)
that generates high-quality message templates and actionable writing guidance
through three complementary modes. First, group-based learning enables the
agent to learn from a merchant's own top-performing messages within the same
audience segment and rewrite low-performing ones. Second,
retrieval-and-adaptation fetches templates that share the same audience segment
and exhibit high similarity in voucher type and product category, learns their
successful patterns, and adapts them to the current campaign. Third, a
rule-based fallback provides a lightweight zero-shot rewrite when no suitable
references are available. Extensive experiments show that CRMAgent consistently
outperforms merchants' original templates, delivering significant gains in both
audience-match and marketing-effectiveness metrics.

*Yuzheng Xu,Tosho Hirasawa,Seiya Kawano,Shota Kato,Tadashi Kozuno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MK2, a prompt-centric pipeline, generates viable product ideas from patents using iterative prompt engineering and AI models, achieving top performance in most domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate the transformation of patents into commercially viable product ideas without requiring additional training data.

Method: Uses Gemini 2.5 for prompt drafting and iterative editing, GPT-4.1 for idea generation, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B for prompt selection.

Result: MK2 outperformed in most domains, winning 25 of 36 tests, though it lagged in materials-chemistry due to domain complexity.

Conclusion: Lightweight prompt engineering can effectively generate competitive, commercially relevant ideas from patents, though deeper domain knowledge may be needed for specialized fields.

Abstract: The Patent-Based Idea Generation task asks systems to turn real patents into
product ideas viable within three years. We propose MK2, a prompt-centric
pipeline: Gemini 2.5 drafts and iteratively edits a prompt, grafting useful
fragments from weaker outputs; GPT-4.1 then uses this prompt to create one idea
per patent, and an Elo loop judged by Qwen3-8B selects the best prompt-all
without extra training data. Across three domains, two evaluator types, and six
criteria, MK2 topped the automatic leaderboard and won 25 of 36 tests. Only the
materials-chemistry track lagged, indicating the need for deeper domain
grounding; yet, the results show that lightweight prompt engineering has
already delivered competitive, commercially relevant ideation from patents.

### [31] [Distillation versus Contrastive Learning: How to Train Your Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08336)
*Zhichao Xu,Zhiqi Huang,Shengyao Zhuang,Ashim Gupta,Vivek Srikumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares contrastive learning and knowledge distillation for training text rerankers, finding distillation superior with a larger teacher model but not with same-capacity ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the effectiveness of contrastive learning vs. knowledge distillation for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical conditions.

Method: Empirical comparison by training rerankers of varying sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a contrastive learning model as the teacher.

Result: Knowledge distillation outperforms contrastive learning with a larger teacher model but not with same-capacity teachers, especially for out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Use knowledge distillation with a larger teacher if available; otherwise, contrastive learning is a reliable alternative.

Abstract: Training text rerankers is crucial for information retrieval. Two primary
strategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on
ground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a
larger reranker). While both have been studied in the literature, a clear
comparison of their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under
practical conditions is needed.
  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of
different sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a
strong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our
results show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and
out-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling
from a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model
sizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same
capacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain
tasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy
based on available teacher models. Therefore, we recommend using knowledge
distillation to train smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is
accessible; in its absence, contrastive learning provides a strong and more
reliable alternative otherwise.

### [32] [What Factors Affect LLMs and RLLMs in Financial Question Answering?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08339)
*Peng Wang,Xuesi Hu,Jiageng Wu,Yuntao Zou,Qiancheng Zhang,Dagang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores methods to enhance LLMs and RLLMs in financial question-answering, finding that prompting and agent frameworks improve LLMs, while RLLMs' inherent Long CoT limits further gains. Multilingual alignment aids LLMs but not RLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate how to unlock the full potential of LLMs and RLLMs in the financial domain, given the lack of prior systematic exploration.

Method: Utilized five LLMs and three RLLMs to evaluate the impact of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment on financial QA tasks.

Result: Prompting and agent frameworks enhance LLMs via Long CoT simulation; RLLMs' inherent Long CoT limits further improvement; multilingual alignment benefits LLMs but not RLLMs.

Conclusion: The study provides valuable insights for optimizing LLMs and RLLMs in financial QA, highlighting limitations and opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) and reasoning large
language models (RLLMs) have gained considerable attention from many
researchers. RLLMs enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through Long
Chain-of-Thought (Long CoT) processes, significantly improving the performance
of LLMs in addressing complex problems. However, there are few works that
systematically explore what methods can fully unlock the performance of LLMs
and RLLMs within the financial domain. To investigate the impact of various
methods on LLMs and RLLMs, we utilize five LLMs and three RLLMs to assess the
effects of prompting methods, agentic frameworks, and multilingual alignment
methods on financial question-answering tasks. Our research findings indicate:
(1) Current prompting methods and agent frameworks enhance the performance of
LLMs in financial question answering by simulating Long CoT; (2) RLLMs possess
inherent Long CoT capabilities, which limits the effectiveness of conventional
methods in further enhancing their performance; (3) Current advanced
multilingual alignment methods primarily improve the multilingual performance
of LLMs by extending the reasoning length, which yields minimal benefits for
RLLMs. We hope that this study can serve as an important reference for LLMs and
RLLMs in the field of financial question answering.

*Itai Mondshine,Tzuf Paz-Argaman,Reut Tsarfaty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates n-gram and neural-based metrics for generative tasks across languages, finding n-gram metrics less effective for fusional languages and advocating for neural-based alternatives like COMET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the suitability of automatic evaluation metrics (n-gram and neural-based) for generative tasks in diverse languages, given their unclear effectiveness beyond English.

Method: A large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages from four typological families, analyzing metric correlation with human judgments.

Result: N-gram metrics show lower correlation with human assessments in fusional languages; proper tokenization helps. Neural-based metrics like COMET outperform others, especially in low-resource languages.

Conclusion: N-gram metrics are limited for fusional languages; investment in neural-based metrics (e.g., COMET) is recommended for better evaluation.

Abstract: Automatic n-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating
generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered
indicative (even if imperfect) of human evaluation for English, their
suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, we
systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation both n-gram-based and
neural based to evaluate their effectiveness across languages and tasks.
Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages
from four typological families: agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and
high-fusional, spanning both low- and high-resource settings, to analyze their
correlation with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of
evaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,
n-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to
isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper
tokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich
fusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends. Additionally, we
show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as
COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and better correlate with
human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the
limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for greater
investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores how multi-agent LLM dialogues enhance scientific idea generation, finding that larger, more diverse agent groups and deeper interactions improve novelty and feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize the design of multi-agent LLM interactions for generating novel and feasible scientific ideas.

Method: Comparative analysis of agent roles, numbers, and dialogue depth in multi-agent LLM setups, including ideation-critique-revision loops.

Result: Larger agent cohorts, deeper interactions, and diverse personas increase idea diversity, while critic-side diversity improves feasibility.

Conclusion: The study provides guidelines for designing effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support creative tasks
such as research idea generation. While recent work has shown that structured
dialogues between LLMs can improve the novelty and feasibility of generated
ideas, the optimal design of such interactions remains unclear. In this study,
we conduct a comprehensive analysis of multi-agent LLM dialogues for scientific
ideation. We compare different configurations of agent roles, number of agents,
and dialogue depth to understand how these factors influence the novelty and
feasibility of generated ideas. Our experimental setup includes settings where
one agent generates ideas and another critiques them, enabling iterative
improvement. Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the
interaction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the
diversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side
diversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the
feasibility of the final proposals. Our findings offer practical guidelines for
building effective multi-agent LLM systems for scientific ideation. Our code is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Finetuning on model-generated data filtered by models' own judgments reduces hallucination better than using factual gold data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing language model hallucination by exploring effective finetuning data strategies.

Method: Study the impact of finetuning data factuality on hallucination, comparing gold data and model-generated data filtered by models' judgments.

Result: Finetuning on filtered model-generated data improves factuality more than gold data or other configurations.

Conclusion: Models' internal judgments can effectively guide finetuning to reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Language models are prone to hallucination - generating text that is
factually incorrect. Finetuning models on high-quality factual information can
potentially reduce hallucination, but concerns remain; obtaining factual gold
data can be expensive and training on correct but unfamiliar data may
potentially lead to even more downstream hallucination. What data should
practitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In
this work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data
and the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.
Counterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as
helpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be
factual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold
data and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data
that is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better
overall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data
filtered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on
model-generated data that is supported by gold data. These factuality
improvements transfer across three domains we study, suggesting that a models'
own beliefs can provide a powerful signal for factuality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChainEdit improves logical consistency in LLM knowledge editing by combining knowledge graphs with LLM reasoning, achieving 30% better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to maintain logical consistency when updating associated facts in LLMs.

Method: ChainEdit integrates knowledge graph-derived rules with LLM reasoning to dynamically edit logically connected knowledge clusters.

Result: 30% improvement in logical generalization over baselines, with maintained reliability and specificity.

Conclusion: ChainEdit sets a new state-of-the-art for ripple effect handling and logical consistency in knowledge editing.

Abstract: Current knowledge editing methods for large language models (LLMs) struggle
to maintain logical consistency when propagating ripple effects to associated
facts. We propose ChainEdit, a framework that synergizes knowledge
graph-derived logical rules with LLM logical reasoning capabilities to enable
systematic chain updates. By automatically extracting logical patterns from
structured knowledge bases and aligning them with LLMs' internal logics,
ChainEdit dynamically generates and edits logically connected knowledge
clusters. Experiments demonstrate an improvement of more than 30% in logical
generalization over baselines while preserving editing reliability and
specificity. We further address evaluation biases in existing benchmarks
through knowledge-aware protocols that disentangle external dependencies. This
work establishes new state-of-the-art performance on ripple effect while
ensuring internal logical consistency after knowledge editing.

*Selina Heller,Mohamed Ibrahim,David Antony Selby,Sebastian Vollmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An LLM-based multi-agent system simulates decision conferences, detecting agreement among agents. Six LLMs are tested for stance and stance polarity detection, showing reliable agreement detection in debates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the potential of LLMs in simulating structured, collaborative decision-making processes like real-world decision conferences.

Method: A multi-agent system with six LLMs is evaluated on stance and stance polarity detection tasks within simulated debates.

Result: LLMs reliably detect agreement in nuanced debates, and an agreement-detection agent improves debate efficiency and coherence.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively simulate group decision-making, supporting expert elicitation workshops across domains.

Abstract: Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring
together experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a
consensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences
often rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and
collective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
significant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through
collaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,
we present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision
conferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant
agents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance
detection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and
stance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,
negative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent
system to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results
indicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced
debates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also
improve the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and
coherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision
conferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate
the potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group
decision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be
instrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops
across various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM evaluation models lack error attribution capability, necessitating an automated framework for systematic error categorization and analysis.

Method: Developed a Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary categories, created the AttriData dataset, and fine-tuned MisAttributionLLM for error attribution.

Result: The proposed method is effective and robust, as confirmed by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The framework and model provide a comprehensive solution for error attribution in LLMs, enhancing performance analysis and failure diagnosis.

Abstract: With the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various
tasks, the mainstream LLM platforms generate massive user-model interactions
daily. In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose
failures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to
systematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation
models lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a
comprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary
categories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present
AttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing
misattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also
propose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first
general-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,
misattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted
to confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs for legal decision-making in VAT law, testing fine-tuning and RAG methods. Results show LLMs can assist tax professionals but aren't ready for full automation due to legal sensitivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess LLMs' potential in automating legal decision-making for VAT law, reducing workload for tax professionals.

Method: Experiments with fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on textbook and real-world tax cases.

Result: LLMs can support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial analyses, but limitations exist in handling implicit knowledge.

Conclusion: Properly configured LLMs are effective for VAT tasks but require further integration of structured background information for full automation.

Abstract: This paper provides an experimental evaluation of the capability of large
language models (LLMs) to assist in legal decision-making within the framework
of Austrian and European Union value-added tax (VAT) law. In tax consulting
practice, clients often describe cases in natural language, making LLMs a prime
candidate for supporting automated decision-making and reducing the workload of
tax professionals. Given the requirement for legally grounded and
well-justified analyses, the propensity of LLMs to hallucinate presents a
considerable challenge. The experiments focus on two common methods for
enhancing LLM performance: fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG). In this study, these methods are applied on both textbook cases and
real-world cases from a tax consulting firm to systematically determine the
best configurations of LLM-based systems and assess the legal-reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. The findings highlight the potential of using LLMs to
support tax consultants by automating routine tasks and providing initial
analyses, although current prototypes are not ready for full automation due to
the sensitivity of the legal domain. The findings indicate that LLMs, when
properly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and
provide legally grounded justifications for decisions. However, limitations
remain regarding the handling of implicit client knowledge and context-specific
documentation, underscoring the need for future integration of structured
background information.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A study proposes using item response theory to enhance machine learning models for scoring essay cohesion, outperforming conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatically scoring textual cohesion in essays is challenging, and existing machine learning models often overlook individual text characteristics.

Method: The approach adapts item response theory to machine learning, using linguistic features from two essay corpora (6,563 ENEM-style essays and 1,235 narrative essays) and treating the task as regression.

Result: The proposed method outperforms conventional machine learning and ensemble methods in evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: This research offers a promising approach for improving automated cohesion evaluation in educational essays.

Abstract: Essays are considered a valuable mechanism for evaluating learning outcomes
in writing. Textual cohesion is an essential characteristic of a text, as it
facilitates the establishment of meaning between its parts. Automatically
scoring cohesion in essays presents a challenge in the field of educational
artificial intelligence. The machine learning algorithms used to evaluate texts
generally do not consider the individual characteristics of the instances that
comprise the analysed corpus. In this meaning, item response theory can be
adapted to the context of machine learning, characterising the ability,
difficulty and discrimination of the models used. This work proposes and
analyses the performance of a cohesion score prediction approach based on item
response theory to adjust the scores generated by machine learning models. In
this study, the corpus selected for the experiments consisted of the extended
Essay-BR, which includes 6,563 essays in the style of the National High School
Exam (ENEM), and the Brazilian Portuguese Narrative Essays, comprising 1,235
essays written by 5th to 9th grade students from public schools. We extracted
325 linguistic features and treated the problem as a machine learning
regression task. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach
outperforms conventional machine learning models and ensemble methods in
several evaluation metrics. This research explores a potential approach for
improving the automatic evaluation of cohesion in educational essays.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces clembench, a tool for evaluating large language models (LLMs) using dialogue game-based evaluation, combining control and ecological validity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing evaluation paradigms (reference-based and preference-based) by offering a reusable, controlled, and goal-directed method for LLM assessment.

Method: Developed clembench, a tool optimized for ease of use, enabling benchmarking of models with provided game instances and extension with custom tests.

Result: clembench provides a mature, reusable implementation for dialogue game-based evaluation, facilitating controlled and repeatable interactions.

Conclusion: clembench bridges the gap between existing evaluation paradigms, offering a practical solution for LLM benchmarking and extension.

Abstract: There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models
(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,
carried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies
on pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are
available. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often
self-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to
several models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their
most preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is
tested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual
use cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged
that combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over
multi-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing
goal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this
approach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by
the lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we
present clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has
in its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how
it can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark
game instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be
extended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaPa is a vision-language model framework for multimodal procedural planning, integrating task-sensitive feature alignment and counterfactual reasoning to enhance plan quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underexplored integration of multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning in LLMs for embodied AI systems.

Method: LLaPa uses VLMs to generate action sequences from text and images, enhanced by TER for task-environment alignment and CAR for counterfactual reasoning.

Result: Outperforms advanced models on ActPlan-1K and ALFRED benchmarks with higher LCS and correctness.

Conclusion: LLaPa advances procedural planning by effectively combining multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have advanced procedural planning for
embodied AI systems through strong reasoning abilities, the integration of
multimodal inputs and counterfactual reasoning remains underexplored. To tackle
these challenges, we introduce LLaPa, a vision-language model framework
designed for multimodal procedural planning. LLaPa generates executable action
sequences from textual task descriptions and visual environmental images using
vision-language models (VLMs). Furthermore, we enhance LLaPa with two auxiliary
modules to improve procedural planning. The first module, the Task-Environment
Reranker (TER), leverages task-oriented segmentation to create a task-sensitive
feature space, aligning textual descriptions with visual environments and
emphasizing critical regions for procedural execution. The second module, the
Counterfactual Activities Retriever (CAR), identifies and emphasizes potential
counterfactual conditions, enhancing the model's reasoning capability in

### [45] [Semantic-Augmented Latent Topic Modeling with LLM-in-the-Loop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08498)
*Mengze Hong,Chen Jason Zhang,Di Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper investigates integrating LLMs with LDA for topic modeling, focusing on initialization and post-correction. While LLM-guided initialization improves early LDA iterations, it doesn't affect convergence and underperforms baselines. LLM post-correction, however, boosts coherence by 5.86%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LDA's performance by leveraging LLMs for initialization and post-correction, addressing LDA's dependency on initialization quality.

Method: Integrates LLMs into LDA's initialization (Gibbs sampling) and post-correction phases, comparing their impact on topic modeling.

Result: LLM initialization improves early LDA iterations but fails to enhance convergence and performs worse than baselines. LLM post-correction improves coherence by 5.86%.

Conclusion: LLMs show practical benefits in post-correction but challenge the assumption of their superiority in all text mining tasks.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prominent generative probabilistic
model used for uncovering abstract topics within document collections. In this
paper, we explore the effectiveness of augmenting topic models with Large
Language Models (LLMs) through integration into two key phases: Initialization
and Post-Correction. Since the LDA is highly dependent on the quality of its
initialization, we conduct extensive experiments on the LLM-guided topic
clustering for initializing the Gibbs sampling algorithm. Interestingly, the
experimental results reveal that while the proposed initialization strategy
improves the early iterations of LDA, it has no effect on the convergence and
yields the worst performance compared to the baselines. The LLM-enabled
post-correction, on the other hand, achieved a promising improvement of 5.86%
in the coherence evaluation. These results highlight the practical benefits of
the LLM-in-the-loop approach and challenge the belief that LLMs are always the
superior text mining alternative.

TL;DR: A feature-centric framework for multilingual multi-label emotion detection, evaluating document representations, dimensionality reduction, and model training across 28 languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address linguistic diversity and resource constraints in multilingual emotion detection by optimizing language-specific performance.

Method: Proposes a dynamic framework adapting document representations (TF-IDF, FastText, Sentence-BERT) and learning algorithms, with PCA for dimensionality reduction. Evaluated in 28 languages.

Result: TF-IDF effective for low-resource languages; contextual embeddings (FastText, Sentence-BERT) show language-specific strengths. PCA reduces training time without performance loss.

Conclusion: The framework offers a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, balancing model complexity and computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for SemEval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in
Text-Based Emotion Detection (Track A), which focuses on multi-label emotion
detection in short texts. We propose a feature-centric framework that
dynamically adapts document representations and learning algorithms to optimize
language-specific performance. Our study evaluates three key components:
document representation, dimensionality reduction, and model training in 28
languages, highlighting five for detailed analysis. The results show that
TF-IDF remains highly effective for low-resource languages, while contextual
embeddings like FastText and transformer-based document representations, such
as those produced by Sentence-BERT, exhibit language-specific strengths.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reduces training time without compromising
performance, particularly benefiting FastText and neural models such as
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). Computational efficiency analysis underscores
the trade-off between model complexity and processing cost. Our framework
provides a scalable solution for multilingual emotion detection, addressing the
challenges of linguistic diversity and resource constraints.

### [49] [A comprehensive study of LLM-based argument classification: from LLAMA through GPT-4o to Deepseek-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08621)
*Marcin Pietroń,Rafał Olszowski,Jakub Gomułka,Filip Gampel,Andrzej Tomski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes the performance of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o, Llama, and DeepSeek in argument mining tasks, highlighting ChatGPT-4o and Deepseek-R1's superiority but also their common errors. It evaluates datasets like Args.me and UKP and identifies weaknesses in prompt algorithms for argument analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The study aims to address the lack of research on LLMs' performance in publicly available argument classification databases, leveraging advancements in LLMs to improve argument mining.

Method: The study tests various LLMs (GPT, Llama, DeepSeek) and reasoning-enhanced variants (e.g., Chain-of-Thoughts) on datasets like Args.me and UKP, comparing their performance in argument classification.

Result: ChatGPT-4o outperforms other models in benchmarks, while Deepseek-R1 excels among reasoning-enhanced models. Both still exhibit errors, with common mistakes analyzed.

Conclusion: The work provides the first broad analysis of LLMs in argument mining, revealing dataset shortcomings and suggesting improvements for prompt algorithms.

Abstract: Argument mining (AM) is an interdisciplinary research field that integrates
insights from logic, philosophy, linguistics, rhetoric, law, psychology, and
computer science. It involves the automatic identification and extraction of
argumentative components, such as premises and claims, and the detection of
relationships between them, such as support, attack, or neutrality. Recently,
the field has advanced significantly, especially with the advent of large
language models (LLMs), which have enhanced the efficiency of analyzing and
extracting argument semantics compared to traditional methods and other deep
learning models. There are many benchmarks for testing and verifying the
quality of LLM, but there is still a lack of research and results on the
operation of these models in publicly available argument classification
databases. This paper presents a study of a selection of LLM's, using diverse
datasets such as Args.me and UKP. The models tested include versions of GPT,
Llama, and DeepSeek, along with reasoning-enhanced variants incorporating the
Chain-of-Thoughts algorithm. The results indicate that ChatGPT-4o outperforms
the others in the argument classification benchmarks. In case of models
incorporated with reasoning capabilities, the Deepseek-R1 shows its
superiority. However, despite their superiority, GPT-4o and Deepseek-R1 still
make errors. The most common errors are discussed for all models. To our
knowledge, the presented work is the first broader analysis of the mentioned
datasets using LLM and prompt algorithms. The work also shows some weaknesses
of known prompt algorithms in argument analysis, while indicating directions
for their improvement. The added value of the work is the in-depth analysis of
the available argument datasets and the demonstration of their shortcomings.

*Cristina Aggazzotti,Matthew Wiesner,Elizabeth Allyn Smith,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speaker attribution from ASR transcripts is resilient to errors and may outperform human-transcribed data due to speaker-specific error patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of ASR transcription errors on speaker attribution, as prior work focused only on human-transcribed data.

Method: Comprehensive study comparing speaker attribution performance using ASR transcripts versus human transcripts, analyzing error resilience and ASR system properties.

Result: Attribution is resilient to word-level errors; ASR transcripts perform as well or better than human transcripts, possibly due to speaker-specific error patterns.

Conclusion: ASR transcripts are viable for speaker attribution, with errors potentially enhancing performance by revealing speaker identity.

Abstract: Speaker attribution from speech transcripts is the task of identifying a
speaker from the transcript of their speech based on patterns in their language
use. This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.
deleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has
primarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts
produced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only
has more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)
systems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first
comprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker
attribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker
attribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well
as how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that
attribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and
that the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated
with attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker
attribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not
better, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR
transcription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker
identity.

*Jiyao Zhang,Chengli Zhong,Hui Xu,Qige Li,Yi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KELPS is a neuro-symbolic framework for translating informal math into formal languages, achieving 88.9% accuracy on MiniF2F.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing bottlenecks in LLMs for formalizing math due to limited multilingual parallel corpora.

Method: Iterative framework using Knowledge Equations (KEs) to translate and synthesize informal data into formal languages (Lean, Coq, Isabelle).

Result: Produced a 60,000-problem corpus and achieved 88.9% syntactic accuracy, outperforming SOTA models.

Conclusion: KELPS effectively bridges informal and formal math, offering high accuracy and scalability.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) show promising progress in formalizing
informal mathematics into machine-verifiable theorems. However, these methods
still face bottlenecks due to the limited quantity and quality of multilingual
parallel corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework
KELPS (Knowledge-Equation based Logical Processing System) to address these
problems. KELPS is an iterative framework for translating, synthesizing, and
filtering informal data into multiple formal languages (Lean, Coq, and
Isabelle). First, we translate natural language into Knowledge Equations (KEs),
a novel language that we designed, theoretically grounded in assertional logic.
Next, we convert them to target languages through rigorously defined rules that
preserve both syntactic structure and semantic meaning. This process yielded a
parallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic
accuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3
(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets. All datasets and codes are
available in the supplementary materials.

*Songlin Zhai,Guilin Qi,Yuan Meng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a test-time KG-augmented framework for LLMs, using a knowledge graph-guided attention (KGA) module for dynamic knowledge fusion without parameter updates, addressing issues like catastrophic forgetting and static integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG-enhanced approaches for LLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting, degraded generalization, and limited adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to static frameworks and parameter-intensive fine-tuning.

Method: The proposed KGA module enhances self-attention with outward (dynamic KG fusion) and inward (KG-guided filtering) pathways, forming a closed-loop mechanism for real-time knowledge fusion without parameter updates.

Result: Experiments on five benchmarks show KGA achieves comparable knowledge fusion performance.

Conclusion: The KGA framework effectively supports real-time knowledge fusion in LLMs without parameter modification, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language
models (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the
learning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on
parameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and
degrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited
adaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration
frameworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time
KG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge
graph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion
without any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard
self-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward
aggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external
knowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward
aggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations
through KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying
knowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles
knowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds
them back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.
By synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports
real-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter
modification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable
knowledge fusion performance of KGA.

TL;DR: MM-Coder integrates visual aids like UML diagrams with text for better code generation, using MMc-Instruct dataset and MMEval benchmark, revealing challenges in multimodal coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs lack visual integration, limiting their real-world software development utility.

Method: Developed MM-Coder, MMc-Instruct dataset, and MMEval benchmark to combine visual and textual inputs for code generation.

Result: MM-Coder improves accuracy but struggles with precise visual capture and advanced programming.

Conclusion: MM-Coder advances multimodal coding but highlights ongoing challenges for industrial adoption.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
improved code generation, yet most models remain text-only, neglecting crucial
visual aids like diagrams and flowcharts used in real-world software
development. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-Coder, a Multilingual
Multimodal software developer. MM-Coder integrates visual design inputs-Unified
Modeling Language (UML) diagrams and flowcharts (termed Visual Workflow)-with
textual instructions to enhance code generation accuracy and architectural
alignment. To enable this, we developed MMc-Instruct, a diverse multimodal
instruction-tuning dataset including visual-workflow-based code generation,
allowing MM-Coder to synthesize textual and graphical information like human
developers, distinct from prior work on narrow tasks. Furthermore, we introduce
MMEval, a new benchmark for evaluating multimodal code generation, addressing
existing text-only limitations. Our evaluations using MMEval highlight
significant remaining challenges for models in precise visual information
capture, instruction following, and advanced programming knowledge. Our work
aims to revolutionize industrial programming by enabling LLMs to interpret and
implement complex specifications conveyed through both text and visual designs.

Motivation: To enhance reasoning in small language models without requiring fine-tuning or prompt changes, leveraging GPT-4o-generated traces for steering.

Method: Uses one-shot cache steering with GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors, applied directly to the key-value cache.

Result: Improves qualitative reasoning structure and quantitative task performance on diverse benchmarks, outperforming prior activation steering techniques.

Conclusion: Cache steering is a robust, efficient, and practical solution for controlled generation, offering hyperparameter stability and ease of integration.

Abstract: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of
language models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value
cache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce
chain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages
GPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift
model behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning
or prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative
structure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to
prior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our
one-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of
hyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,
making it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs underperform in specialized agricultural tasks, necessitating a more reliable solution for crop disease identification and treatment.

Method: The framework uses prompt-based expert evaluation and a cosine-consistency self-voting mechanism to enhance VLM outputs.

Result: Improvements include diagnostic accuracy (82.2% to 87.8%), symptom analysis (38.9% to 52.2%), and treatment recommendation (27.8% to 43.3%).

Conclusion: The compact, deployable system shows promise for reliable AI-driven precision agriculture in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: Precision agriculture relies heavily on accurate image analysis for crop
disease identification and treatment recommendation, yet existing
vision-language models (VLMs) often underperform in specialized agricultural
domains. This work presents a domain-aware framework for agricultural image
processing that combines prompt-based expert evaluation with self-consistency
mechanisms to enhance VLM reliability in precision agriculture applications. We
introduce two key innovations: (1) a prompt-based evaluation protocol that
configures a language model as an expert plant pathologist for scalable
assessment of image analysis outputs, and (2) a cosine-consistency self-voting
mechanism that generates multiple candidate responses from agricultural images
and selects the most semantically coherent diagnosis using domain-adapted
embeddings. Applied to maize leaf disease identification from field images
using a fine-tuned PaliGemma model, our approach improves diagnostic accuracy
from 82.2\% to 87.8\%, symptom analysis from 38.9\% to 52.2\%, and treatment
recommendation from 27.8\% to 43.3\% compared to standard greedy decoding. The
system remains compact enough for deployment on mobile devices, supporting
real-time agricultural decision-making in resource-constrained environments.
These results demonstrate significant potential for AI-driven precision
agriculture tools that can operate reliably in diverse field conditions.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework to evaluate Text-to-Image models' adherence to prompts, revealing their struggles with simple binary image generation and distribution alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the reliability and robustness of Text-to-Image models, which lack sufficient research compared to text-only LLMs.

Method: Created a novel dataset and pipeline using GPT-4o for ground-truth images and descriptions, evaluating Stable Diffusion and Janus models.

Result: Models struggled with simple binary images and failed to align with input dataset distribution.

Conclusion: Text-to-Image models need improvement in prompt adherence and robustness, highlighting gaps in current research.

Abstract: The advancements in the domain of LLMs in recent years have surprised many,
showcasing their remarkable capabilities and diverse applications. Their
potential applications in various real-world scenarios have led to significant
research on their reliability and effectiveness. On the other hand, multimodal
LLMs and Text-to-Image models have only recently gained prominence, especially
when compared to text-only LLMs. Their reliability remains constrained due to
insufficient research on assessing their performance and robustness. This paper
aims to establish a comprehensive evaluation framework for Text-to-Image
models, concentrating particularly on their adherence to prompts. We created a
novel dataset that aimed to assess the robustness of these models in generating
images that conform to the specified factors of variation in the input text
prompts. Our evaluation studies present findings on three variants of Stable
Diffusion models: Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, and
Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large Turbo, and two variants of Janus models: Janus Pro
1B and Janus Pro 7B. We introduce a pipeline that leverages text descriptions
generated by the gpt-4o model for our ground-truth images, which are then used
to generate artificial images by passing these descriptions to the
Text-to-Image models. We then pass these generated images again through gpt-4o
using the same system prompt and compare the variation between the two
descriptions. Our results reveal that these models struggle to create simple
binary images with only two factors of variation: a simple geometric shape and
its location. We also show, using pre-trained VAEs on our dataset, that they
fail to generate images that follow our input dataset distribution.

TL;DR: The paper proposes CNTLoRA, a data-driven initialization method for LoRA weights, improving convergence and performance in fine-tuning tasks like image generation and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance LoRA fine-tuning by addressing random initialization limitations and leveraging pre-training data for better weight estimates.

Method: CNTLoRA formulates LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem, using constraints to derive closed-form weight estimates without training, with variable ranks for flexibility.

Result: CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven initialization methods in tasks like image generation and classification, with faster convergence.

Conclusion: The proposed CNTLoRA method provides an effective, training-free initialization for LoRA, improving fine-tuning performance and convergence.

Abstract: Foundation models are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently
fine-tuned on small-scale datasets using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
techniques like low-rank adapters (LoRA). In most previous works, LoRA weight
matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment
points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA
fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method,
ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift
problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and
fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a
closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and
fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during
initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and
down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed
initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image
generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and
data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations
further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal
recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.

image classification and applied to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The
proposed methodology is a hierarchical ELM learning framework that consists of
two main phases: 1) self-taught feature extraction and 2) supervised feature
classification. First, unsupervised multilayer feature encoding is achieved by
stacking a number of ELM-AEs, in which input data is projected into a number of
high-level representations. At the second phase, the final features are
classified using a novel Simplified Interval Type-2 Fuzzy ELM (SIT2-FELM) with
a fast output reduction layer based on the SC algorithm; an improved version of
the algorithm Center of Sets Type Reducer without Sorting Requirement
(COSTRWSR). To validate the efficiency of the HML-ELM, two types of experiments
for the classification of images are suggested. First, the HML-ELM is applied
to solve a number of benchmark problems for image classification. Secondly, a
number of real experiments to the active classification and transport of four
different objects between two predefined locations using a UAV is implemented.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed HML-ELM delivers a superior
efficiency compared to other similar methodologies such as ML-ELM, Multilayer
Fuzzy Extreme Learning Machine (ML-FELM) and ELM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve preprocessing of hyperspectral satellite images by identifying effective machine learning models for cloud and shadow masking.

Method: Evaluated gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) and CNNs, focusing on accuracy, storage, and inference speed.

Result: All models exceeded 93% accuracy; CNNs with feature reduction were most efficient, balancing accuracy, storage, and speed.

Conclusion: Lightweight AI models, especially CNNs, are promising for real-time hyperspectral image processing in satellite applications.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in
hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality,
analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches,
including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved
accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature
reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy,
low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs.
Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters,
demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy,
and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of
lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral
image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems
for space-based applications.

### [62] [The relative importance of being Gaussian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08059)
*F. Alberto Grünbaum,Tondgi Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the performance of denoising algorithms, originally designed for Gaussian noise, when applied to non-Gaussian noise types like uniform or Beta distributions, without modifying the algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate the robustness of denoising algorithms when the noise type deviates significantly from the Gaussian assumption, without altering the algorithm itself.

Method: The study uses the same denoising algorithm but replaces Gaussian noise with non-Gaussian noise (e.g., uniform, Beta, or mixed Gaussians) and evaluates performance on a small-scale setup (laptop, minimal image size).

Result: The results highlight how the algorithm performs under non-Gaussian noise, though the exact outcomes are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: The findings suggest further exploration is needed to understand how these observations scale to more powerful systems and larger datasets.

Abstract: The remarkable results for denoising in computer vision using diffusion
models given in \cite{SDWMG,HJA,HHG} yield a robust mathematical justification
for algorithms based on crucial properties of a sequence of Gaussian
independent $N(0,1)$ random variables. In particular the derivations use the
fact that a Gaussian distribution is determined by its mean and variance and
that the sum of two Gaussians is another Gaussian.
  \bigskip
  The issue raised in this short note is the following: suppose we use the
algorithm without any changes but replace the nature of the noise and use, for
instance, uniformly distributed noise or noise with a Beta distribution, or
noise which is a random superposition of two Gaussians with very different
variances. One could, of course, try to modify the algorithm keeping in mind
the nature of the noise, but this is not what we do. Instead we study the
performance of the algorithm when used with noise that is very far in nature
from the Gaussian case, where it is designed to work well.
  Usually these algorithms are implemented on very powerful computers. Our
experiments are all carried out on a small laptop and for the smallest possible
image size. Exploring how our observations are confirmed or changed when
dealing in different situations remains an interesting challenge.

*Babak Memar,Luigi Russo,Silvia Liberata Ullo,Paolo Gamba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DL-based method for automated building height estimation from VHR SAR images, tested on a diverse dataset, shows strong performance in Europe but faces challenges in Asia.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate building height estimation from VHR SAR imagery is vital for urban applications, but existing methods lack robustness across diverse regions.

Method: Object-based regression using bounding box detection and height estimation, trained on a multi-continental dataset with cross-validation for OOD generalization.

Result: Achieves MAE of ~2.20m in European cities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, but struggles with variability in Asian cities.

Conclusion: DL shows promise for cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building height estimation, though challenges remain in highly diverse urban areas.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of building heights using very high resolution (VHR)
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for various urban
applications. This paper introduces a Deep Learning (DL)-based methodology for
automated building height estimation from single VHR COSMO-SkyMed images: an
object-based regression approach based on bounding box detection followed by
height estimation. This model was trained and evaluated on a unique
multi-continental dataset comprising eight geographically diverse cities across
Europe, North and South America, and Asia, employing a cross-validation
strategy to explicitly assess out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The
results demonstrate highly promising performance, particularly on European
cities where the model achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately
one building story (2.20 m in Munich), significantly outperforming recent
state-of-the-art methods in similar OOD scenarios. Despite the increased
variability observed when generalizing to cities in other continents,
particularly in Asia with its distinct urban typologies and prevalence of
high-rise structures, this study underscores the significant potential of DL
for robust cross-city and cross-continental transfer learning in building
height estimation from single VHR SAR data.

*Chong Cheng,Yu Hu,Sicheng Yu,Beizhen Zhao,Zijian Wang,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegGS is a 3D Gaussian registration framework for reconstructing unposed sparse views by aligning local 3D Gaussians into a globally consistent representation using an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods struggle with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge, and feed-forward approaches are constrained by input formats. RegGS aims to overcome these limitations.

Method: RegGS uses an entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to solve the optimal transport MW₂ distance for GMM alignment in Sim(3) space. It integrates MW₂ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry in a joint registration module.

Result: Experiments on RE10K and ACID datasets show RegGS achieves high-fidelity registration, precise pose estimation, and high-quality novel-view synthesis.

Conclusion: RegGS effectively addresses sparse-view reconstruction challenges, offering a robust solution for unposed image scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated its potential in reconstructing
scenes from unposed images. However, optimization-based 3DGS methods struggle
with sparse views due to limited prior knowledge. Meanwhile, feed-forward
Gaussian approaches are constrained by input formats, making it challenging to
incorporate more input views. To address these challenges, we propose RegGS, a
3D Gaussian registration-based framework for reconstructing unposed sparse
views. RegGS aligns local 3D Gaussians generated by a feed-forward network into
a globally consistent 3D Gaussian representation. Technically, we implement an
entropy-regularized Sinkhorn algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal
transport Mixture 2-Wasserstein $(\text{MW}_2)$ distance, which serves as an
alignment metric for Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) in $\mathrm{Sim}(3)$ space.
Furthermore, we design a joint 3DGS registration module that integrates the
$\text{MW}_2$ distance, photometric consistency, and depth geometry. This
enables a coarse-to-fine registration process while accurately estimating
camera poses and aligning the scene. Experiments on the RE10K and ACID datasets
demonstrate that RegGS effectively registers local Gaussians with high
fidelity, achieving precise pose estimation and high-quality novel-view
synthesis. Project page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/reggs/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for dynamic human-object interaction reconstruction from monocular video, addressing occlusions and temporal inconsistencies using amodal completion and temporal context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods fail under occlusions and dynamic conditions, necessitating a more robust approach.

Method: Leverages amodal completion and temporal context for coherent, incremental refinement of reconstructions without predefined models.

Result: Superior precision in handling occlusions and temporal stability, validated via 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging videos.

Conclusion: The framework outperforms existing techniques by adapting to dynamic scenes and recovering intricate details.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object
interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with
occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods
typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading
to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in
scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework
leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially
obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual
frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across
video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This
template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on
predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in
dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on
challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling
occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

Motivation: To enhance robustness against adversarial attacks in vision models by adapting to inputs and improving certified accuracy.

Method: Reinterpret guided denoising diffusion models as adaptive GDP mechanisms, composed via a GDP privacy filter for end-to-end robustness analysis.

Result: Improves both certified and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an ℓ₂ threat model.

Conclusion: The method effectively certifies predictions and enhances accuracy, demonstrating the potential of adaptive diffusion models in adversarial robustness.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Diffusion Denoised Smoothing, a method for certifying the
predictions of a vision model against adversarial examples, while adapting to
the input. Our key insight is to reinterpret a guided denoising diffusion model
as a long sequence of adaptive Gaussian Differentially Private (GDP) mechanisms
refining a pure noise sample into an image. We show that these adaptive
mechanisms can be composed through a GDP privacy filter to analyze the
end-to-end robustness of the guided denoising process, yielding a provable
certification that extends the adaptive randomized smoothing analysis. We
demonstrate that our design, under a specific guiding strategy, can improve
both certified accuracy and standard accuracy on ImageNet for an $\ell_2$
threat model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visually impaired people face daily commuting challenges due to urban obstructions, leading to frequent injuries. A system is needed to alert them of nearby objects.

Method: The system combines transfer learning-based depth estimation and object detection models, optimized with quantization for lightweight deployment on embedded systems.

Result: Achieved a real-time model with mAP50 of 0.801.

Conclusion: The proposed system effectively assists visually impaired individuals by providing real-time alerts for nearby objects.

Abstract: Visually impaired people face significant challenges in their day-to-day
commutes in the urban cities of Bangladesh due to the vast number of
obstructions on every path. With many injuries taking place through road
accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that
can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To
overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to
assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without
colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to
objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to
train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both
models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the
utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient,
allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution
achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model
with an mAP50 of 0.801.

*Ken C. L. Wong,Hongzhi Wang,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HNOSeg-XS, a resolution-robust architecture for medical image segmentation, addressing limitations of CNNs and transformers by using learnable PDEs via the Hartley transform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs and transformers face challenges in capturing long-range correlations efficiently due to computational costs and input size constraints, leading to suboptimal results at higher resolutions.

Method: The proposed HNOSeg-XS models segmentation via learnable PDEs using the Fourier neural operator, modified with the Hartley transform for efficiency.

Result: HNOSeg-XS outperforms CNNs and transformers in resolution robustness, speed (<0.24s), memory efficiency (<1.8 GiB), and parameter efficiency (<34.7k parameters) on BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets.

Conclusion: HNOSeg-XS is a highly efficient, resolution-robust solution for medical image segmentation, surpassing traditional methods in performance and resource usage.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of
convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through
consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and
memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer
layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For
transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head
attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is
computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size
reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation.
Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise
training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on
higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the
resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by
learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator
which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier
transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the
frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust,
fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the
BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS
showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model
parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and
memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D instance segmentation by decoupling instance parameterization from voxel resolution and avoiding voxelization artifacts.

Method: Modifies StarDist-3D to predict instances as smooth parametric surfaces, enabling high-resolution upsampling.

Result: Outperforms StarDist-3D in blob-shaped biomedical datasets with more compact parameterizations.

Conclusion: Interpretable surface models can be learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for
three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction
of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric
surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a
modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks
StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance
voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to
arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,
SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance
parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one
synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.
These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be
learned effectively alongside instance membership.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge lies in fine-grained fungi species identification due to high variation within and between species.

Conclusion: Domain-specific pretraining and balanced sampling are effective, but metadata and multi-modal learning need further work.

Abstract: Accurate identification of fungi species presents a unique challenge in

intra-species variation. This paper presents our approach for the FungiCLEF
2025 competition, which focuses on few-shot fine-grained visual categorization
(FGVC) using the FungiTastic Few-Shot dataset. Our team (DS@GT) experimented
with multiple vision transformer models, data augmentation, weighted sampling,
and incorporating textual information. We also explored generative AI models
for zero-shot classification using structured prompting but found them to
significantly underperform relative to vision-based models. Our final model
outperformed both competition baselines and highlighted the effectiveness of
domain specific pretraining and balanced sampling strategies. Our approach
ranked 35/74 on the private test set in post-completion evaluation, this

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Portable Biomechanics Laboratory (PBL), a smartphone-based tool for objectively measuring movement in clinical settings, validated for accuracy and usability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Movement is a key indicator of health but is underutilized in clinical practice due to lack of accessible measurement methods.

Method: PBL combines a cloud-enabled smartphone app with a novel algorithm to fit biomechanical models to movement data, validated across diverse clinical populations.

Result: PBL achieved joint angle errors within 3 degrees and showed high reliability, sensitivity to clinical differences, and better responsiveness than patient-reported outcomes.

Conclusion: PBL offers a scalable, low-burden solution for biomechanical measurement, enabling accessible monitoring of mobility impairments.

Abstract: The way a person moves is a direct reflection of their neurological and
musculoskeletal health, yet it remains one of the most underutilized vital
signs in clinical practice. Although clinicians visually observe movement
impairments, they lack accessible and validated methods to objectively measure
movement in routine care. This gap prevents wider use of biomechanical
measurements in practice, which could enable more sensitive outcome measures or
earlier identification of impairment. We present our Portable Biomechanics
Laboratory (PBL), which includes a secure, cloud-enabled smartphone app for
data collection and a novel algorithm for fitting biomechanical models to this
data. We extensively validated PBL's biomechanical measures using a large,
clinically representative dataset. Next, we tested the usability and utility of
our system in neurosurgery and sports medicine clinics. We found joint angle
errors within 3 degrees across participants with neurological injury,
lower-limb prosthesis users, pediatric inpatients, and controls. In addition to
being easy to use, gait metrics computed from the PBL showed high reliability
and were sensitive to clinical differences. For example, in individuals
undergoing decompression surgery for cervical myelopathy, the mJOA score is a
common patient-reported outcome measure; we found that PBL gait metrics
correlated with mJOA scores and demonstrated greater responsiveness to surgical
intervention than the patient-reported outcomes. These findings support the use
of handheld smartphone video as a scalable, low-burden tool for capturing
clinically meaningful biomechanical data, offering a promising path toward
accessible monitoring of mobility impairments. We release the first clinically
validated method for measuring whole-body kinematics from handheld smartphone

TL;DR: CR-Net improves cross-resolution SAR target detection by integrating structure priors and evidential learning, addressing challenges in domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Higher SAR resolution causes scattering discrepancies, degrading target detection model generalization. Domain adaptation struggles with blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation.

Method: CR-Net uses Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation (SHFA) for structure-aware feature adaptation and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA) for semantic alignment.

Result: CR-Net achieves SOTA performance in cross-resolution SAR target detection by preserving intra-domain structures and enhancing discriminability.

Conclusion: CR-Net effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in SAR target detection, offering reliable cross-resolution performance.

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly
benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,
the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering
characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target
detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,
the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to
blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately
degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this
paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that
incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection
model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To
be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature
Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA
module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and
achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the
interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module
is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure
adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source
domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the
detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from
different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances
cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving
discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in
cross-resolution SAR target detection.

TL;DR: M2DAO-Talker introduces a unified framework for audio-driven talking head generation, improving motion modeling and rendering quality through multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D methods for talking head generation suffer from rendering artifacts like motion blur and temporal jitter due to unstable motion fields. The goal is to enhance motion representation and synthesis quality.

Method: The framework involves video preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. It uses multi-granular motion decoupling (non-rigid and rigid motions) and alternating optimization for refinement.

Result: M2DAO-Talker outperforms TalkingGaussian with a 2.43 dB PSNR improvement, 0.64 gain in user-evaluated realness, and 150 FPS inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses motion artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance in talking head generation.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film
production. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content
synthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,
temporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing
stable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate
talking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video
preprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This
framework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current
limitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating
optimization.Specifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline
to extract frame-wise deformation control conditions (motion region
segmentation masks, and camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation.
To ameliorate motion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling
strategy, which independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid
(head) motions for improved reconstruction accuracy.Meanwhile, a motion
consistency constraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency,
thereby mitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In
addition, an alternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively
refine facial and oral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video
generation.Experiments across multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation
quality and 0.64 gain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian
while with 150 FPS inference speed. Our project homepage is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework using convolutional Siamese networks for craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science, achieving satisfactory identification results from skull X-rays to faces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve forensic identification by mapping skull X-rays to corresponding faces using deep learning, addressing the challenge of limited paired data.

Method: Uses convolutional Siamese networks trained on a custom dataset of 40 volunteers' skull X-rays and face images, minimizing Euclidean distance for similar pairs and maximizing for dissimilar ones.

Result: Satisfactory identification results were achieved on the cross-domain dataset.

Conclusion: The Siamese network framework is effective for skull-to-face identification, demonstrating potential for forensic applications.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensic science is crucial for the
identification of the victims of crimes and disasters. The objective is to map
a given skull to its corresponding face in a corpus of faces with known
identities using recent advancements in computer vision, such as deep learning.
In this paper, we presented a framework for the identification of a person
given the X-ray image of a skull using convolutional Siamese networks for
cross-domain identity representation. Siamese networks are twin networks that
share the same architecture and can be trained to discover a feature space
where nearby observations that are similar are grouped and dissimilar
observations are moved apart. To do this, the network is exposed to two sets of
comparable and different data. The Euclidean distance is then minimized between
similar pairs and maximized between dissimilar ones. Since getting pairs of
skull and face images are difficult, we prepared our own dataset of 40
volunteers whose front and side skull X-ray images and optical face images were
collected. Experiments were conducted on the collected cross-domain dataset to
train and validate the Siamese networks. The experimental results provide
satisfactory results on the identification of a person from the given skull.

*Nikita Malik,Pratinav Seth,Neeraj Kumar Singh,Chintan Chitroda,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces an interpretability-guided pruning framework for deep learning models in medical imaging, reducing complexity while maintaining performance and transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models in medical imaging are often large and opaque, limiting clinical adoption. Interpretability techniques can help assess model components, but reducing model size without losing transparency is a challenge.

Method: The proposed framework uses interpretability techniques (DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, Integrated Gradients) to guide pruning, selectively retaining relevant parts of each layer for targeted compression.

Result: Experiments show high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss across medical image classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method enables lightweight, interpretable models suitable for real-world healthcare deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet
its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and
lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques
such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated
Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components
within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we
introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model
complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By
selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method
enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful
representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with
minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models
suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

*Sangwon Kim,In-su Jang,Pyongkun Kim,Kwang-Ju Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCo-Bot is a post-hoc, composable concept bottleneck model that improves interpretability and controllability by eliminating auxiliary visual cues, using diffusion-based energy functions for robust interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous generative CBMs rely on auxiliary visual cues, which compromise interpretability and compositionality. CoCo-Bot aims to address this by transmitting all information through explicit concepts.

Method: CoCo-Bot uses diffusion-based energy functions to support post-hoc interventions like concept composition and negation, eliminating the need for auxiliary cues.

Result: Experiments on StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show improved concept-level controllability and interpretability while maintaining visual quality.

Conclusion: CoCo-Bot enhances generative modeling by improving interpretability and controllability without sacrificing visual quality.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable and controllable
generative modeling by routing generation through explicit,
human-understandable concepts. However, previous generative CBMs often rely on
auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck to compensate for information not
captured by the concepts, which undermines interpretability and
compositionality. We propose CoCo-Bot, a post-hoc, composable concept
bottleneck generative model that eliminates the need for auxiliary cues by
transmitting all information solely through explicit concepts. Guided by
diffusion-based energy functions, CoCo-Bot supports robust post-hoc
interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary
concepts. Experiments using StyleGAN2 pre-trained on CelebA-HQ show that
CoCo-Bot improves concept-level controllability and interpretability, while
maintaining competitive visual quality.

### [78] [Single-Domain Generalization for Multimodal Cross-Cancer Prognosis via Dirac Rebalancer and Distribution Entanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08340)
*Jia-Xuan Jiang,Jiashuai Liu,Hongtao Wu,Yifeng Wu,Zhong Wang,Qi Bi,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the poor generalization of multimodal prognosis models across cancer types, proposing two modules (SDIR and CADE) to enhance weaker modality signals and improve cross-cancer performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal methods for survival prediction lack generalization across cancer types, a critical need in clinical practice.

Method: Introduces SDIR (sparsification and stabilization for weaker modalities) and CADE (synthesizing target domain distribution) to improve cross-cancer generalization.

Result: Experiments show superior generalization on a four-cancer-type benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed modules lay the foundation for robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data
for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on
single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across
cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis
models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios,
despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address
this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for
Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer
type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded
features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To
tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information
Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR
mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based
sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality
signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses
local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space.
Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior
generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer
multimodal prognosis. Code is available at

### [79] [Towards Imperceptible JPEG Image Hiding: Multi-range Representations-driven Adversarial Stego Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08343)
*Junxue Yang,Xin Liao,Weixuan Tang,Jianhua Yang,Zheng Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRAG introduces a multi-range adversarial stego generation framework for deep hiding in JPEG images, combining convolution and transformer operators for improved stealth and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep hiding methods are easily detected due to large payloads and limited feature extraction, prompting the need for a more robust approach.

Method: MRAG integrates local-range convolution and global-range transformer features, uses multi-grained frequency decomposition inputs, and employs a features angle-norm disentanglement loss.

Result: MRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance in maintaining secret restorability and imperceptibility.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses detection vulnerabilities in deep hiding, offering superior adversarial stego generation.

Abstract: Deep hiding has been exploring the hiding capability of deep learning-based
models, aiming to conceal image-level messages into cover images and reveal
them from generated stego images. Existing schemes are easily detected by
steganalyzers due to their large payloads and their limitation to feature
extraction based solely on either pure convolution or pure transformer
operators within a single range, as well as pixel-level loss constraints. To
address the issue, in this paper, we introduce generation-based adversarial
attacks into color JPEG image deep hiding and propose a multi-range
representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG from
a steganalysis perspective. Specifically, we integrate the local-range neighbor
reception characteristic of the convolution and the global-range dependency
modeling of the transformer to construct MRAG. Meanwhile, we use the
transformed images obtained through coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency
decomposition as inputs, introducing multi-grained information. Furthermore, a
features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to constrain the generated
stegos closer to covers in the angle and norm space of the steganalyzer's
classified features. Consequently, small yet effective adversarial
perturbations can be injected into the process of generating stegos, ensuring
that stegos maintain favorable secret restorability and imperceptibility.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

### [81] [Cycle Context Verification for In-Context Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08357)
*Shishuai Hu,Zehui Liao,Liangli Zhen,Huazhu Fu,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a framework to improve in-context learning (ICL) for medical image segmentation by self-verifying predictions and enhancing contextual alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The performance of ICL in medical image segmentation is sensitive to query-context alignment, and fine-tuning is impractical due to computational costs and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: CCV uses a cyclic pipeline to generate and validate segmentation masks, improving alignment via query-specific prompts.

Result: CCV outperforms existing methods on seven datasets, enhancing ICL-based segmentation.

Conclusion: CCV is a robust solution for universal medical image segmentation, with code made available.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving
universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest
across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless,
its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image
and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of
annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context
pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible
due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address
this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework
that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling
self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual
alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model
initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the
roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to
validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context
image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure
of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to
alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the
alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven
medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,
demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight
CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution
for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at

*Yuki Yoshihara,Linjing Jiang,Nihan Karatas,Hitoshi Kanamori,Asuka Harada,Takahiro Tanaka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores ChatGPT-4o's ability to interpret traffic scenes for elderly driver assessments, showing improved performance with better prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if multimodal LLMs like ChatGPT-4o can perform human-like traffic scene interpretations, focusing on tasks relevant to elderly drivers.

Method: Evaluated ChatGPT-4o using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting on traffic density, intersection visibility, and stop sign recognition tasks, comparing results to human annotations.

Result: Prompt design significantly impacted performance, with recall for intersection visibility rising from 21.7% to 57.0%. Traffic density agreement improved from 53.5% to 67.6%. Stop-sign detection showed high precision (86.3%) but lower recall (76.7%).

Conclusion: Well-designed prompts make LLMs promising for driving risk assessments. Future work should explore scalability with larger datasets and advanced models.

Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model
(LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of
traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment
tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density,
assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition.
These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection.
Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated
the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference
standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results
indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for
intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%
(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In
stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a
lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response
tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced
difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's
explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing
interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs
hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments.
Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse
annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver
assessments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve visual quality and enhance downstream computer vision tasks by addressing video degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces GEFU, a method bridging low-light enhancement and understanding, using diffusion models and SCUF for improved generalization and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the separation between low-light enhancement and understanding, and overcoming limitations of existing methods in generalization and scalability.

Method: Leverages pretrained generative diffusion models for zero-shot generalization and proposes SCUF with illumination-aware prompts and cycle-attention adapters.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: GEFU successfully bridges enhancement and understanding, offering a scalable and generalizable solution for low-light vision tasks.

Abstract: Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision
have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves
image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or
geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual
quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding,
constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain
adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a
generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding,
which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm
improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of
low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to
optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on
this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF).
Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an
illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and
propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To
mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and
reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and
GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing datasets for artwork object detection are biased towards image centers and lack fine-grained object classes, limiting their utility for real-world applications in the humanities.

Method: The authors propose the ODOR dataset with 38,116 object-level annotations across 4712 images, covering 139 fine-grained categories. They conduct statistical analyses and baseline model evaluations.

Result: The dataset exhibits challenging properties like dense, overlapping objects and spatial distribution across the canvas. Baseline analyses reveal its difficulty for object detection models.

Conclusion: ODOR fills a critical gap in artwork object detection datasets, encouraging research at the intersection of object recognition and smell perception in cultural heritage studies.

Abstract: Real-world applications of computer vision in the humanities require
algorithms to be robust against artistic abstraction, peripheral objects, and
subtle differences between fine-grained target classes. Existing datasets
provide instance-level annotations on artworks but are generally biased towards
the image centre and limited with regard to detailed object classes. The
proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations
across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories.
Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties,
such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and
spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an
extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the
challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies.
Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual
cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the
intersection of object recognition and smell perception.

*Zhanxin Gao,Beier Zhu,Liang Yao,Jian Yang,Ying Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDi is a framework for generating consistent subject identities in text-to-image models while maintaining pose and layout diversity, using a two-stage strategy (Identity Transport and Identity Refinement).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for subject-consistent generation sacrifice layout and pose diversity, limiting expressive storytelling. CoDi aims to overcome this by balancing consistency and diversity.

Method: CoDi employs a two-stage approach: Identity Transport (early denoising) transfers identity features pose-aware, and Identity Refinement (later denoising) refines details by selecting salient features.

Result: CoDi outperforms in subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity, achieving better visual perception and performance metrics.

Conclusion: CoDi successfully addresses the trade-off between subject consistency and pose diversity, enhancing text-to-image generation capabilities.

Abstract: Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject
identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I)
models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the
cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To
address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I
framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with
diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion,
where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi
adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement
(IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to
transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This
promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in
the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to
further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results
on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that
CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all
metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanMatch is a versatile foundation model for 2D displacement estimation, eliminating task-specific architectures and achieving multi-task integration with robust generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of task-specific architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning in correspondence matching tasks.

Method: Uses a 2D displacement estimation framework with shared model weights, leveraging a robust feature extractor and feature transformation pipeline from Large Vision Models.

Result: Outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything in cross-task evaluations and matches state-of-the-art task-specific algorithms. Excels in zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios.

Conclusion: PanMatch demonstrates versatility and robustness across diverse tasks and domains, offering a unified solution for correspondence matching.

Abstract: This work presents PanMatch, a versatile foundation model for robust
correspondence matching. Unlike previous methods that rely on task-specific
architectures and domain-specific fine-tuning to support tasks like stereo
matching, optical flow or feature matching, our key insight is that any
two-frame correspondence matching task can be addressed within a 2D
displacement estimation framework using the same model weights. Such a
formulation eliminates the need for designing specialized unified architectures
or task-specific ensemble models. Instead, it achieves multi-task integration
by endowing displacement estimation algorithms with unprecedented
generalization capabilities. To this end, we highlight the importance of a
robust feature extractor applicable across multiple domains and tasks, and
propose the feature transformation pipeline that leverage all-purpose features
from Large Vision Models to endow matching baselines with zero-shot cross-view
matching capabilities. Furthermore, we assemble a cross-domain dataset with
near 1.8 million samples from stereo matching, optical flow, and feature
matching domains to pretrain PanMatch. We demonstrate the versatility of
PanMatch across a wide range of domains and downstream tasks using the same
model weights. Our model outperforms UniMatch and Flow-Anything on cross-task
evaluations, and achieves comparable performance to most state-of-the-art
task-specific algorithms on task-oriented benchmarks. Additionally, PanMatch
presents unprecedented zero-shot performance in abnormal scenarios, such as
rainy day and satellite imagery, where most existing robust algorithms fail to
yield meaningful results.

*Li Chen,Rui Liu,Yuxiang Zhou,Xudong Ma,Yong Chen,Dell Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHC introduces semantic hash centers to improve image retrieval by preserving semantic relationships between classes, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current point-wise hashing methods use data-independent hash centers, neglecting semantic relationships, which may degrade retrieval performance.

Method: A three-stage framework (SHC): 1) Classification network for semantic similarity, 2) Optimization for semantic hash centers, 3) Deep hashing network for binary codes.

Result: SHC improves MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL by +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%, respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SHC effectively preserves semantic structure in hash codes, enhancing large-scale image retrieval performance.

Abstract: Deep hashing is an effective approach for large-scale image retrieval.
Current methods are typically classified by their supervision types:
point-wise, pair-wise, and list-wise. Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,
MDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each
class, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.
However, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash
centers, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may
degrade retrieval performance.
  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the
idea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of
semantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those
of unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a
three-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic
structure.
  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities
between classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to
varying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to
generate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing
a minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.
Finally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to
convert images into binary hash codes.
  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public
datasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.
Specifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%
in MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGCP introduces a novel prompt learning paradigm for VLMs, addressing challenges in class embedding and cross-modal alignment by leveraging MLLMs and mutual-guidance modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization on novel classes and enhance cross-modal alignment in VLMs by addressing limitations in current prompt learning methods.

Method: Uses MLLMs for adaptive Semantic Conditional Prompts (SCP), an Attention Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module for Visual Conditional Prompts (VCP), and a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 14 datasets.

Conclusion: MuGCP effectively enhances prompt learning in VLMs through conditional prompt generation and cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant
challenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen
instances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)
prevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the
final output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits
their capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal
embedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance
Conditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt
generation. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as
conditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts
(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for
image instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the
multi-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention
Mutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and
semantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual
Conditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal
tasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that
integrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination
among the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and
instance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after
publication.

TL;DR: InstaScene introduces a novel method for holistic 3D scene perception, enabling precise decomposition and complete reconstruction of occluded objects in cluttered environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans excel at identifying and completing occluded objects, but robotics struggle with this task due to limitations in current reconstruction techniques.

Method: The paper proposes spatial contrastive learning for precise decomposition and in-situ generation for complete reconstruction, leveraging observations and geometric cues.

Result: Experiments show superior decomposition accuracy and geometrically faithful, visually intact object reconstructions in complex scenes.

Conclusion: InstaScene advances 3D perception by effectively decomposing and completing objects in cluttered environments.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify and mentally complete occluded objects in
cluttered environments. However, imparting similar cognitive ability to
robotics remains challenging even with advanced reconstruction techniques,
which models scenes as undifferentiated wholes and fails to recognize complete
object from partial observations. In this paper, we propose InstaScene, a new
paradigm towards holistic 3D perception of complex scenes with a primary goal:
decomposing arbitrary instances while ensuring complete reconstruction. To
achieve precise decomposition, we develop a novel spatial contrastive learning
by tracing rasterization of each instance across views, significantly enhancing
semantic supervision in cluttered scenes. To overcome incompleteness from
limited observations, we introduce in-situ generation that harnesses valuable
observations and geometric cues, effectively guiding 3D generative models to
reconstruct complete instances that seamlessly align with the real world.
Experiments on scene decomposition and object completion across complex
real-world and synthetic scenes demonstrate that our method achieves superior
decomposition accuracy while producing geometrically faithful and visually

### [91] [Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422)
*Wongi Jeong,Kyungryeol Lee,Hoigi Seo,Se Young Chun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RALU accelerates diffusion transformers by mixed-resolution sampling and noise-timestep rescheduling, achieving up to 7x speed-up with minimal quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heavy computation in diffusion transformers hinders real-world deployment; existing methods focus on temporal acceleration, leaving spatial dimension underutilized.

Method: RALU uses three stages: low-resolution denoising, region-adaptive upsampling, and full-resolution refinement, with noise-timestep rescheduling for stability.

Result: Achieves up to 7x speed-up on FLUX and 3x on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation.

Conclusion: RALU is a training-free, complementary spatial acceleration method for diffusion transformers, enhancing efficiency without compromising quality.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based
diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering
superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle
to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the
temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps.
Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free
framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs
mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising
latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2)
region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at
full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail
refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage
noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying
resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving
image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$
on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is
complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus
can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without
compromising generation quality.

### [92] [RePaintGS: Reference-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Realistic and View-Consistent 3D Scene Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08434)
*Ji Hyun Seo,Byounhyun Yoo,Gerard Jounghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3D scene inpainting method improves geometric fidelity and appearance consistency by leveraging a reference view to guide optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for object removal in radiance fields lead to inconsistencies due to varied inpainting results across views.

Method: Uses a reference view to estimate inpainting similarity, constructs accurate geometry, and warps the reference inpainting to other views for guidance.

Result: Enhances both geometric fidelity and appearance consistency in inpainted scenes.

Conclusion: The proposed method reliably produces realistic and perceptually consistent results for complex scenes.

Abstract: Radiance field methods, such as Neural Radiance Field or 3D Gaussian
Splatting, have emerged as seminal 3D representations for synthesizing
realistic novel views. For practical applications, there is ongoing research on
flexible scene editing techniques, among which object removal is a
representative task. However, removing objects exposes occluded regions, often
leading to unnatural appearances. Thus, studies have employed image inpainting
techniques to replace such regions with plausible content - a task referred to
as 3D scene inpainting. However, image inpainting methods produce one of many
plausible completions for each view, leading to inconsistencies between
viewpoints. A widely adopted approach leverages perceptual cues to blend
inpainted views smoothly. However, it is prone to detail loss and can fail when
there are perceptual inconsistencies across views. In this paper, we propose a
novel 3D scene inpainting method that reliably produces realistic and
perceptually consistent results even for complex scenes by leveraging a
reference view. Given the inpainted reference view, we estimate the inpainting
similarity of the other views to adjust their contribution in constructing an
accurate geometry tailored to the reference. This geometry is then used to warp
the reference inpainting to other views as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the
optimization to match the reference appearance. Comparative evaluation studies
have shown that our approach improves both the geometric fidelity and
appearance consistency of inpainted scenes.

### [93] [Vision Foundation Models as Effective Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08441)
*Anlin Zheng,Xin Wen,Xuanyang Zhang,Chuofan Ma,Tiancai Wang,Gang Yu,Xiangyu Zhang,Xiaojuan Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VFMTok, a novel image tokenizer built on pre-trained vision models, improves image reconstruction, generation, and token efficiency with region-adaptive quantization and semantic reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore the underutilized potential of pre-trained vision models for image tokenization, enhancing semantic fidelity and efficiency.

Method: Uses a frozen vision model as an encoder, introduces region-adaptive quantization and a semantic reconstruction objective.

Result: Achieves gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet, 3x faster convergence, and high-fidelity synthesis without CFG.

Conclusion: VFMTok demonstrates superior performance in image tokenization, offering efficiency and quality improvements.

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation
models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel
direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely
underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as
the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two
key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces
redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic
reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the
foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on
these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial
improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also
enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation --
achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model
convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional
synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be
released publicly to benefit the community.

*Wei Zhang,Yihang Wu,Songhua Li,Wenjie Ma,Xin Ma,Qiang Li,Qi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper surveys deep learning-based 3D reconstruction, focusing on feed-forward models like DUSt3R, which jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry in a single pass, contrasting them with traditional methods and earlier learning-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., SfM, MVS) are computationally expensive and struggle in challenging scenarios. Deep learning offers a faster, more robust alternative.

Method: The paper reviews feed-forward models, particularly DUSt3R, which use unified deep networks for joint pose and geometry inference, leveraging Transformer-based correspondence and multi-view scaling strategies.

Result: Feed-forward models simplify workflows, reduce computational costs, and improve robustness in challenging scenarios compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: Deep learning-based 3D reconstruction shows promise but faces challenges like accuracy, scalability, and dynamic scene handling, with broad applications in AR/VR, autonomous driving, and robotics.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction, which aims to recover the dense three-dimensional
structure of a scene, is a cornerstone technology for numerous applications,
including augmented/virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics. While
traditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo
(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited
by complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in
challenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has
catalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,
exemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models
employ a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry
directly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This
survey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by
dissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including
their Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry
regression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view
scenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast
it with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like
MVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation
metrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and
identify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and
scalability, and handling dynamic scenes.

*Benjamin Meyer,Lukas Tuggener,Sascha Hänzi,Daniel Schmid,Erdal Ayfer,Benjamin F. Grewe,Ahmed Abdulkadir,Thilo Stadelmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes treating document recognition as a transcription task, leveraging intrinsic document structures to improve accuracy and adaptability for complex or less common document types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current document recognition methods ignore intrinsic structural properties, relying on heuristics and limiting applicability to complex or rare document types.

Method: Introduces structure-specific inductive biases and a transformer architecture adaptable to various document structures, demonstrated on sheet music, shape drawings, and engineering drawings.

Result: Successfully trains the first end-to-end model for transcribing engineering drawings and shows effectiveness across progressively complex structures.

Conclusion: The approach advances document recognition by unifying design principles for future foundation models, especially for less understood document types.

Abstract: Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to
encode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing
engineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document
recognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying
document-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on
sub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more
complicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We
suggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription
task from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents
based on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related
document types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to
design structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned
end-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer
architecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments
with progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape
drawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias
for unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful
end-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently
interlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of
document recognition systems for document types that are less well understood
than standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of
future document foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F3-Net is a foundation model for clinical medical image segmentation, addressing challenges like incomplete multimodal inputs and limited generalizability. It uses flexible synthetic modality training and a zero-image strategy to handle missing MRI sequences, achieving robust performance across multiple pathologies without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to overcome persistent issues in clinical medical image segmentation, such as reliance on complete multimodal inputs, poor generalizability, and narrow task specificity, to enhance real-world applicability.

Method: F3-Net employs flexible synthetic modality training and a zero-image strategy to substitute missing MRI sequences without explicit synthesis networks. Its unified architecture supports multi-pathology segmentation without retraining.

Conclusion: F3-Net is a versatile, scalable solution that bridges the gap between deep learning research and practical clinical deployment, offering robust performance across multiple pathologies without requiring retraining.

Abstract: F3-Net is a foundation model designed to overcome persistent challenges in
clinical medical image segmentation, including reliance on complete multimodal
inputs, limited generalizability, and narrow task specificity. Through flexible
synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the
presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to
substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks,
thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports
multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white
matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and
transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.
Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,

### [97] [Dual Dimensions Geometric Representation Learning Based Document Dewarping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08492)
*Heng Li,Qingcai Chen,Xiangping Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces D2Dewarp, a fine-grained deformation perception model for document image dewarping that leverages dual dimensions (horizontal and vertical lines) and a fusion module for improved results. It also proposes an automatic annotation method to create a large-scale training dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dewarping methods focus only on horizontal dimensions, limiting their effectiveness. The paper aims to address this by incorporating vertical line awareness for better distortion perception.

Method: D2Dewarp uses a dual-dimensional approach (horizontal and vertical lines) with a fusion module for feature interaction. An automatic annotation method generates a large-scale dataset for training.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on public benchmarks, showing better rectification results.

Conclusion: D2Dewarp improves document dewarping by leveraging dual dimensions and a novel dataset, achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Document image dewarping remains a challenging task in the deep learning era.
While existing methods have improved by leveraging text line awareness, they
typically focus only on a single horizontal dimension. In this paper, we
propose a fine-grained deformation perception model that focuses on Dual
Dimensions of document horizontal-vertical-lines to improve document Dewarping
called D2Dewarp. It can perceive distortion trends in different directions
across document details. To combine the horizontal and vertical granularity
features, an effective fusion module based on X and Y coordinate is designed to
facilitate interaction and constraint between the two dimensions for feature
complementarity. Due to the lack of annotated line features in current public
dewarping datasets, we also propose an automatic fine-grained annotation method
using public document texture images and an automatic rendering engine to build
a new large-scale distortion training dataset. The code and dataset will be
publicly released. On public Chinese and English benchmarks, both quantitative
and qualitative results show that our method achieves better rectification
results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The dataset will be
publicly available at https://github.com/xiaomore/DocDewarpHV

*Yufei Zheng,Wenjun Wang,Wenjun Gan,Jiawei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OGFR introduces occlusion-guided feature purification via reinforced knowledge distillation to address challenges in occluded person re-identification, improving robustness against diverse occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with unseen occlusion scenarios and feature contamination from holistic images, limiting performance.

Method: OGFR uses a teacher-student distillation framework with an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer and a Feature Erasing and Purification Module to model diverse occlusions and purify features.

Result: The method effectively transfers purified holistic knowledge to the occluded branch, enhancing feature representation despite occlusions.

Conclusion: OGFR outperforms existing approaches by mitigating occlusion challenges and improving discriminative feature learning.

Abstract: Occluded person re-identification aims to retrieve holistic images based on
occluded ones. Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,
applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using
holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion
scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from
holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided
Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),
which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student
distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion
patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified
discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch
through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware
Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern
embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding
occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature
Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent
is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that
contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and
substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature
contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.
Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch
effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust
representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.

*Inye Na,Nejung Rue,Jiwon Chung,Hyunjin Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RadiomicsRetrieval is a 3D content-based medical image retrieval framework combining radiomics and deep learning for flexible, tumor-level queries with minimal user input.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for medical image retrieval are limited to 2D images and require fully annotated queries, restricting clinical flexibility.

Method: The framework integrates handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning embeddings, uses a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) for tumor-specific embeddings, and aligns these with radiomics features via contrastive learning. Anatomical positional embedding (APE) enriches the representations.

Result: Experiments on lung CT and brain MRI datasets show radiomics features improve retrieval specificity, and APE aids location-based searches. The framework works with minimal prompts (e.g., a single point).

Conclusion: RadiomicsRetrieval offers adaptable, efficient retrieval for clinical use, supporting diagnosis, treatment planning, and research with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Medical image retrieval is a valuable field for supporting clinical
decision-making, yet current methods primarily support 2D images and require
fully annotated queries, limiting clinical flexibility. To address this, we
propose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging
handcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the
tumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits
volumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ
a promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image
embeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same
tumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by
anatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables
flexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive
experiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that
radiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE
provides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.
Notably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single
point), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical
scenarios. The capability to query using either image embeddings or selected
radiomics attributes highlights its adaptability, potentially benefiting
diagnosis, treatment planning, and research on large-scale medical imaging
repositories. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve SAM 2's handling of distractors, occlusions, and motion by optimizing memory updates with reinforcement learning instead of hand-crafted rules.

Method: Proposes reinforcement learning to frame memory control as a sequential decision-making problem, testing in an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video.

Result: Achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 exceeding 3x the gains of existing heuristics.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning unlocks the potential of SAM 2's memory bank, offering a superior alternative to hand-crafted rules for memory control in tracking.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has demonstrated strong performance in
object segmentation tasks and has become the state-of-the-art for visual object
tracking. The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank,
enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment
SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions,
and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using
reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory
control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a
separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2
that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These
results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight
reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules
for memory control in visual object tracking.

*Cristina Mata,Michael S. Ryoo,Henrik Turbell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA-KPN, a novel image translation method, ensures semantic matching for synthetic-to-real data translation, outperforming GAN-based methods in semantic segmentation with limited real labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the domain gap in semantic segmentation caused by synthetic training data and noisy pixel labels, ensuring semantic matching in translations.

Method: DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise transformation parameters using a lightweight function and enforces realism with multi-scale discriminators.

Result: Outperforms GAN-based methods on syn2real benchmarks and achieves comparable performance in face parsing.

Conclusion: DA-KPN provides a robust solution for semantic segmentation by guaranteeing semantic matching in synthetic-to-real translations.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve
the best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate
annotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic
datasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing
domain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.
Current methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial
networks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic
matching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the
semantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where
performance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image
translation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that
guarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.
DA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight
and simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is
realistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between
translated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based
methods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to
real image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISC introduces a dual-stream paradigm for 3D Semantic Scene Completion, enhancing instance and scene category learning by replacing voxel queries with class queries and specialized decoding modules. It achieves SOTA performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Voxel-level features limit class-level information utilization, which is crucial for improving completion granularity.

Method: Proposes DISC, a dual-stream paradigm with class queries and specialized decoding modules for targeted interactions.

Result: Achieves mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55 on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360, outperforming SOTA methods.

Conclusion: DISC significantly improves instance and scene completion, demonstrating superior performance with single-frame input.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its
pivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on
refining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels
as the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level
information, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of
completion results. To address this, we propose \textbf{D}isentangling Instance
and Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning
for both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.
Specifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which
incorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we
exploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding
modules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level
information flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and
SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,
respectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using
only single-frame input and significantly improves instance category
performance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by
17.9\% and 11.9\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test. The code is

achieved average Dice coefficient of 0.8505 and 95% Hausdorff distance of
2.8256mm across enhancing tumor, tumor core, and whole tumor regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods including SCAU-Net, CA-Net, and 3D

spatial modules to boundary precision. Conclusion: Multi-modal semantic fusion
combined with bidirectional interactive attention significantly enhances brain
tumor segmentation performance, establishing new paradigms for integrating
clinical knowledge into medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BayesTTA addresses gradual distribution shifts in vision-language models by using Bayesian adaptation for temporally consistent predictions and dynamic representation alignment, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing continual test-time adaptation methods fail under gradual temporal distribution shifts, leading to issues like catastrophic forgetting and unreliable confidence estimates.

Method: BayesTTA uses Bayesian adaptation, estimating class-conditional Gaussian mixtures, adaptive covariance selection, and calibrated inference with GDA to align representations dynamically.

Result: BayesTTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on temporally evolving datasets and generalizes well on standard TTA benchmarks.

Conclusion: BayesTTA effectively handles gradual distribution shifts, improving robustness and performance in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
recognition but degrade significantly under \textit{temporally evolving
distribution shifts} common in real-world scenarios (e.g., gradual illumination
or seasonal changes). Existing continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods
are typically built around sudden and severe distribution shifts and neglect
temporal continuity, leading to three core defects: limited memory cache
restricts long-range distribution modeling, causing catastrophic forgetting;
entropy-based confidence becomes unreliable under temporal drift, worsening
error accumulation; and static visual representations misalign with evolving
inputs. We formalize this practical problem as \textit{Continual-Temporal
Test-Time Adaptation (CT-TTA)}, where test distributions evolve gradually over
time. To address it, we propose \textit{BayesTTA}, a Bayesian adaptation
framework that enforces temporally consistent predictions and dynamically
aligns visual representations. Specifically, BayesTTA incrementally estimates
class-conditional Gaussian mixture distributions without storing raw data,
adaptively selects covariance structures through statistical hypothesis
testing, and performs calibrated inference using Gaussian discriminant analysis
(GDA). These calibrated predictions supervise self-paced adaptation of
normalization layers, ensuring efficient and stable representation alignment.
We establish a comprehensive CT-TTA benchmark across four temporally evolving
datasets and further evaluate generalization on ten standard TTA datasets.
Extensive experiments show that BayesTTA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains while maintaining
efficiency. Code is available at

TL;DR: The study evaluates the Document Attention Network (DAN) for extracting key-value data from handwritten Uruguayan birth certificates, comparing two annotation strategies with minimal training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the efficiency of transcribing handwritten documents by testing DAN with different annotation methods.

Method: Fine-tuning DAN on two datasets with the same images but different annotation strategies (normalized and diplomatic).

Result: Normalized annotation works better for standardized fields (dates, places), while diplomatic annotation excels for non-standardized fields (names, surnames).

Conclusion: Annotation strategy should align with the type of field (standardized or not) for optimal transcription accuracy.

Abstract: This study evaluates the recently proposed Document Attention Network (DAN)
for extracting key-value information from Uruguayan birth certificates,
handwritten in Spanish. We investigate two annotation strategies for
automatically transcribing handwritten documents, fine-tuning DAN with minimal
training data and annotation effort. Experiments were conducted on two datasets
containing the same images (201 scans of birth certificates written by more
than 15 different writers) but with different annotation methods. Our findings
indicate that normalized annotation is more effective for fields that can be
standardized, such as dates and places of birth, whereas diplomatic annotation
performs much better for fields containing names and surnames, which can not be
standardized.

### [107] [OnlineBEV: Recurrent Temporal Fusion in Bird's Eye View Representations for Multi-Camera 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08644)
*Junho Koh,Youngwoo Lee,Jungho Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Jun Won Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnlineBEV introduces a recurrent structure for temporal 3D perception, using MBFNet for feature alignment and Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic changes in BEV features due to object motion limit performance gains from temporal aggregation. OnlineBEV addresses this by aligning features over time.

Method: Uses a recurrent structure (OnlineBEV) with MBFNet for motion-guided feature alignment and Temporal Consistency Learning Loss to enforce alignment.

Result: Achieves 63.9% NDS on nuScenes, outperforming SOLOFusion and setting a new benchmark for camera-only 3D object detection.

Conclusion: OnlineBEV effectively combines temporal BEV features with minimal memory, advancing 3D perception performance through explicit feature alignment.

Abstract: Multi-view camera-based 3D perception can be conducted using bird's eye view
(BEV) features obtained through perspective view-to-BEV transformations.
Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods
can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from
multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of
an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited
when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to
dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this
paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,
which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This
structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal
memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time
to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion
Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion
features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV
features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal
feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which
captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments
conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves
significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.
OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording
state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.

*Haoran Sun,Haoyu Bian,Shaoning Zeng,Yunbo Rao,Xu Xu,Lin Mei,Jianping Gou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DatasetAgent automates high-quality image dataset construction using multiagent collaboration and MLLMs, outperforming manual methods and synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual dataset construction is time-intensive; synthetic data lacks real-world value. DatasetAgent addresses this by leveraging real-world images.

Method: Uses a multiagent system with MLLMs and image optimization tools to auto-construct datasets based on user requirements.

Result: Successfully expands existing datasets and creates new ones, validated by training vision models for classification, detection, and segmentation.

Conclusion: DatasetAgent efficiently constructs real-world image datasets, proving superior to manual and synthetic methods.

Abstract: Common knowledge indicates that the process of constructing image datasets
usually depends on the time-intensive and inefficient method of manual
collection and annotation. Large models offer a solution via data generation.
Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to
artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image
datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing
datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as
DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image
optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets
according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of
experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating
new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases,
multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various
vision models for image classification, object detection, and image
segmentation.

### [109] [Generalizable 7T T1-map Synthesis from 1.5T and 3T T1 MRI with an Efficient Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08655)
*Zach Eidex,Mojtaba Safari,Tonghe Wang,Vanessa Wildman,David S. Yu,Hui Mao,Erik Middlebrooks,Aparna Kesewala,Xiaofeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) synthesizes 7T-quality T1-maps from 1.5T/3T T1W images, outperforming ResViT and ResShift with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI provides superior resolution but is costly and scarce. This work aims to make 7T-quality imaging accessible via standard 1.5T/3T scans.

Method: The model was trained on paired 1.5T/3T and 7T T1 maps from MS patients, validated against ResViT and ResShift, and tested on mixed-field datasets.

Result: 7T-Restormer achieved higher PSNR, SSIM, and lower NMSE than competitors, with 64% and 41% NMSE reductions at 1.5T and similar gains at 3T.

Conclusion: The model successfully predicts 7T-quality maps from lower-field scans, enhancing clinical workflow accessibility.

Abstract: Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over
standard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,
scarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.
We propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize
7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:
Our model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding
7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128
slices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),
19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145
slices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,
respectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and
ResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-
4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,
and 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using
10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter
ResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter
ResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T
(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus
was superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T
increased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely
on 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We
propose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T
and 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.
Our approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical
workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ByDeWay is a training-free framework using Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP) to enhance MLLMs' spatial reasoning and grounding without altering model parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve MLLMs' performance in spatial reasoning and reduce hallucinations without requiring training or parameter changes.

Method: Segments scenes into depth layers (closest, mid-range, farthest) using monocular depth estimation, generates region-specific captions, and appends them to prompts for enriched spatial context.

Result: Consistent improvements on hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks across multiple MLLMs.

Conclusion: Depth-aware prompting (LDP) effectively enhances MLLMs' grounding and reasoning in a zero-training setting.

Abstract: We introduce ByDeWay, a training-free framework designed to enhance the
performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ByDeWay uses a novel
prompting strategy called Layered-Depth-Based Prompting (LDP), which improves
spatial reasoning and grounding without modifying any model parameters. It
segments the scene into closest, mid-range, and farthest layers using monocular
depth estimation, then generates region-specific captions with a grounded
vision-language model. These structured, depth-aware captions are appended to
the image-question prompt, enriching it with spatial context. This guides MLLMs
to produce more grounded and less hallucinated responses. Our method is
lightweight, modular, and compatible with black-box MLLMs. Experiments on
hallucination-sensitive (POPE) and reasoning-intensive (GQA) benchmarks show
consistent improvements across multiple MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of
depth-aware prompting in a zero-training setting.

TL;DR: MoSAiC is a unified framework for multi-modal satellite imagery, combining intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with multi-label supervision to improve semantic disentanglement and representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contrastive learning (CL) excels in learning transferable representations without large labeled datasets, but existing CL frameworks struggle with Earth System Observation (ESO) challenges like high inter-class similarity and multi-label alignment.

Method: Introduces MoSAiC, a framework jointly optimizing intra- and inter-modality contrastive learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss.

Result: MoSAiC outperforms fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in accuracy, cluster coherence, and generalization on BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS datasets.

Conclusion: MoSAiC addresses ESO challenges effectively, offering robust representation learning for spectrally similar and spatially complex classes in satellite imagery.

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for learning
transferable representations without the reliance on large labeled datasets.
Its ability to capture intrinsic similarities and differences among data
samples has led to state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks. These
strengths make CL particularly well-suited for Earth System Observation (ESO),
where diverse satellite modalities such as optical and SAR imagery offer
naturally aligned views of the same geospatial regions. However, ESO presents
unique challenges, including high inter-class similarity, scene clutter, and
ambiguous boundaries, which complicate representation learning -- especially in
low-label, multi-label settings. Existing CL frameworks often focus on
intra-modality self-supervision or lack mechanisms for multi-label alignment
and semantic precision across modalities. In this work, we introduce MoSAiC, a
unified framework that jointly optimizes intra- and inter-modality contrastive
learning with a multi-label supervised contrastive loss. Designed specifically
for multi-modal satellite imagery, MoSAiC enables finer semantic
disentanglement and more robust representation learning across spectrally
similar and spatially complex classes. Experiments on two benchmark datasets,
BigEarthNet V2.0 and Sent12MS, show that MoSAiC consistently outperforms both
fully supervised and self-supervised baselines in terms of accuracy, cluster
coherence, and generalization in low-label and high-class-overlap scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free MRI muscle segmentation method using keypoint tracking and optical flow achieves comparable accuracy to CNNs with lower computational cost and better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CNN-based MRI muscle segmentation methods are computationally expensive, require large datasets, and lack interpretability, especially for smaller muscles.

Method: Proposes a training-free approach combining keypoint tracking with Lucas-Kanade optical flow for segmentation.

Result: Achieves a mean DSC of 0.6-0.7, comparable to CNNs, with reduced computational demands and improved interpretability.

Conclusion: The method offers a scalable, robust, and explainable alternative for muscle segmentation in clinical and research settings.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables non-invasive, high-resolution
analysis of muscle structures. However, automated segmentation remains limited
by high computational costs, reliance on large training datasets, and reduced
accuracy in segmenting smaller muscles. Convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based methods, while powerful, often suffer from substantial
computational overhead, limited generalizability, and poor interpretability
across diverse populations. This study proposes a training-free segmentation
approach based on keypoint tracking, which integrates keypoint selection with
Lucas-Kanade optical flow. The proposed method achieves a mean Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) ranging from 0.6 to 0.7, depending on the keypoint selection
strategy, performing comparably to state-of-the-art CNN-based models while
substantially reducing computational demands and enhancing interpretability.
This scalable framework presents a robust and explainable alternative for
muscle segmentation in clinical and research applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: L-CLIPScore is a lightweight, efficient embedding-based captioning metric derived from a compressed and distilled version of CLIP, using weight multiplexing, matrix decomposition, and a novel Similarity Regulator loss for improved vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a more efficient and resource-friendly metric for evaluating caption quality and training captioning models, addressing the computational demands of existing methods like CLIP.

Method: Compresses CLIP via weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition, and distills it using a novel Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to enhance vision-language alignment.

Result: L-CLIP achieves comparable performance to CLIP with fewer resources and faster runtime. L-CLIPScore proves effective for caption evaluation but requires mixing with n-gram metrics for training.

Conclusion: L-CLIPScore is a viable, efficient alternative for caption evaluation, though hybrid use with n-gram metrics is recommended for training stability.

Abstract: We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore
that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training
captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP),
which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To
compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and
matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding
matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity
Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.
Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the
given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is
non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP
achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it
requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive
experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when
using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when
using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be
mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore
only will cause fail training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGPMIL introduces a probabilistic attention-based MIL framework using Sparse Gaussian Processes for uncertainty quantification in instance relevance, improving reliability and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deterministic attention-based MIL methods lack uncertainty quantification in instance relevance, which is crucial for reliable predictions in digital pathology.

Method: SGPMIL uses Sparse Gaussian Processes to model posterior distributions over attention scores, incorporating feature scaling for efficiency and performance.

Result: SGPMIL maintains competitive bag-level performance while enhancing instance-level prediction quality and interpretability under uncertainty.

Conclusion: SGPMIL effectively addresses uncertainty in MIL, offering improved reliability and interpretability for digital pathology applications.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) offers a natural solution for settings where
only coarse, bag-level labels are available, without having access to
instance-level annotations. This is usually the case in digital pathology,
which consists of gigapixel sized images. While deterministic attention-based
MIL approaches achieve strong bag-level performance, they often overlook the
uncertainty inherent in instance relevance. In this paper, we address the lack
of uncertainty quantification in instance-level attention scores by introducing
\textbf{SGPMIL}, a new probabilistic attention-based MIL framework grounded in
Sparse Gaussian Processes (SGP). By learning a posterior distribution over
attention scores, SGPMIL enables principled uncertainty estimation, resulting
in more reliable and calibrated instance relevance maps. Our approach not only
preserves competitive bag-level performance but also significantly improves the
quality and interpretability of instance-level predictions under uncertainty.
SGPMIL extends prior work by introducing feature scaling in the SGP predictive
mean function, leading to faster training, improved efficiency, and enhanced
instance-level performance. Extensive experiments on multiple well-established
digital pathology datasets highlight the effectiveness of our approach across
both bag- and instance-level evaluations. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: Existing datasets for multi-camera vehicle tracking are limited by simplistic scenarios, low resolution, and lack of diversity, hindering real-world applicability.

Method: The authors introduce RoundaboutHD, a dataset with 40 minutes of 4K footage from four non-overlapping cameras, annotating 512 unique vehicles for cross-camera tracking.

Result: RoundaboutHD includes temporal consistency, occlusions, and nonlinear movements, with subsets for detection, tracking, and re-identification tasks. Baseline results are provided.

Conclusion: RoundaboutHD bridges the gap between academic research and real-world applications, offering a robust benchmark for multi-camera vehicle tracking.

Abstract: The multi-camera vehicle tracking (MCVT) framework holds significant
potential for smart city applications, including anomaly detection, traffic
density estimation, and suspect vehicle tracking. However, current publicly
available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios,
low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a
considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill
this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution
multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to
represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40
minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping,
high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle
identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich
cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video
footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear
movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several
subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and
image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information
and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further
analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ensembles of weak learners using spectral total-variation (STV) features to address lack of training data in computer vision, outperforming deep learning and Radiomics in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of sufficient training data in computer vision motivates the use of STV features, which are lowly correlated and effective for texture characterization.

Method: Designs ensembles of weak learners based on STV features, validated on a medical imaging problem using CT and PET data.

Result: STV learners achieve the highest AUC (0.87) compared to neural nets (0.75) and Radiomics (0.79), with fine STV scales in CT being particularly predictive.

Conclusion: STV-based ensembles are effective for medical imaging, especially for predicting high PET uptake from CT data, outperforming other methods.

Abstract: Solving computer vision problems through machine learning, one often
encounters lack of sufficient training data. To mitigate this we propose the
use of ensembles of weak learners based on spectral total-variation (STV)
features (Gilboa 2014). The features are related to nonlinear eigenfunctions of
the total-variation subgradient and can characterize well textures at various
scales. It was shown (Burger et-al 2016) that, in the one-dimensional case,
orthogonal features are generated, whereas in two-dimensions the features are
empirically lowly correlated. Ensemble learning theory advocates the use of
lowly correlated weak learners. We thus propose here to design ensembles using
learners based on STV features. To show the effectiveness of this paradigm we
examine a hard real-world medical imaging problem: the predictive value of
computed tomography (CT) data for high uptake in positron emission tomography
(PET) for patients suspected of skeletal metastases. The database consists of
457 scans with 1524 unique pairs of registered CT and PET slices. Our approach
is compared to deep-learning methods and to Radiomics features, showing STV
learners perform best (AUC=0.87), compared to neural nets (AUC=0.75) and
Radiomics (AUC=0.79). We observe that fine STV scales in CT images are
especially indicative for the presence of high uptake in PET.

Conclusion: NeuralOS advances toward fully adaptive neural interfaces, despite challenges in fine-grained keyboard modeling.

Abstract: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user

NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HieraRS, a hierarchical interpretation paradigm for LCLU classification, addressing challenges in multi-granularity predictions and cross-domain transfer with heterogeneous hierarchies. It proposes BHCCM for hierarchical consistency and TransLU for cross-domain adaptation, alongside a new dataset, MM-5B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods for LCLU classification lack hierarchical prediction capabilities and struggle with cross-domain tasks involving heterogeneous hierarchies, limiting practical flexibility and generalization.

Method: The paper proposes HieraRS, featuring BHCCM for hierarchical predictions and TransLU for cross-domain transfer, supported by the MM-5B dataset.

Result: HieraRS improves semantic consistency and classification accuracy, enabling efficient transfer to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies.

Conclusion: HieraRS enhances the flexibility and generalization of LCLU models, offering a robust solution for hierarchical and cross-domain classification tasks.

Abstract: Hierarchical land cover and land use (LCLU) classification aims to assign
pixel-wise labels with multiple levels of semantic granularity to remote
sensing (RS) imagery. However, existing deep learning-based methods face two
major challenges: 1) They predominantly adopt a flat classification paradigm,
which limits their ability to generate end-to-end multi-granularity
hierarchical predictions aligned with tree-structured hierarchies used in
practice. 2) Most cross-domain studies focus on performance degradation caused
by sensor or scene variations, with limited attention to transferring LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous hierarchies (e.g., LCLU to crop
classification). These limitations hinder the flexibility and generalization of
LCLU models in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
HieraRS, a novel hierarchical interpretation paradigm that enables
multi-granularity predictions and supports the efficient transfer of LCLU
models to cross-domain tasks with heterogeneous tree-structured hierarchies. We
introduce the Bidirectional Hierarchical Consistency Constraint Mechanism
(BHCCM), which can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream flat classification
models to generate hierarchical predictions, while improving both semantic

### [120] [Geo-ORBIT: A Federated Digital Twin Framework for Scene-Adaptive Lane Geometry Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08743)
*Rei Tamaru,Pei Li,Bin Ran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-ORBIT introduces a unified framework for dynamic roadway geometry sensing in Digital Twins, combining real-time lane detection, DT synchronization, and federated meta-learning to address scalability, privacy, and efficiency challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for Digital Twins in transportation rely on static maps or costly sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability, and face challenges in privacy, communication, and computational efficiency.

Method: The framework includes GeoLane (lightweight lane detection), Meta-GeoLane (personalized detection), and FedMeta-GeoLane (federated learning for privacy-preserving adaptation), integrated with CARLA and SUMO for high-fidelity DT.

Result: FedMeta-GeoLane outperforms baselines with lower geometric error, better generalization, and reduced communication overhead.

Conclusion: Geo-ORBIT provides a scalable, privacy-preserving foundation for context-aware infrastructure modeling in Digital Twins.

Abstract: Digital Twins (DT) have the potential to transform traffic management and
operations by creating dynamic, virtual representations of transportation
systems that sense conditions, analyze operations, and support decision-making.
A key component for DT of the transportation system is dynamic roadway geometry
sensing. However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly
sensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs
that collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,
communication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we
introduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated
Twin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT
synchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is
GeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from
vehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through
Meta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local
entities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures
scalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our
system is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that
renders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive
experiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently
outperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric
error and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically
reducing communication overhead. This work lays the foundation for flexible,
context-aware infrastructure modeling in DTs. The framework is publicly
available at https://github.com/raynbowy23/FedMeta-GeoLane.git.

### [121] [Compress Any Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08765)
*Juntong Fan,Zhiwei Hao,Jianqiang Shen,Shang-Ling Jui,Yi Zhang,Jing-Xiao Liao,Feng-Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Birkhoff is a data-free compression algorithm for SAMs, offering versatility, agility, faithfulness, and compactness. It achieves high compression ratios with minimal performance drop and fast compression times.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The widespread use of SAMs in diverse fields creates a need for efficient compression methods to reduce model size without sacrificing performance.

Method: Birkhoff introduces Hyper-Compression, a technique to reduce high-dimensional parameters to low-dimensional scalars, and HyperLinear, a dedicated operator to speed up inference.

Result: Experiments on 18 SAMs show Birkhoff achieves a 5.17x compression ratio with <1% performance drop and completes compression in under 60 seconds.

Conclusion: Birkhoff is a highly effective, data-free compression method for SAMs, balancing speed, performance, and model size.

Abstract: Due to the excellent performance in yielding high-quality, zero-shot
segmentation, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its variants have been widely
applied in diverse scenarios such as healthcare and intelligent manufacturing.
Therefore, effectively compressing SAMs has become an increasingly pressing
practical need. In this study, we propose Birkhoff, a novel data-free
compression algorithm for SAM and its variants. Unlike quantization, pruning,
distillation, and other compression methods, Birkhoff embodies versatility
across model types, agility in deployment, faithfulness to the original model,
and compactness in model size. Specifically, Birkhoff introduces a novel
compression algorithm: Hyper-Compression, whose core principle is to find a
dense trajectory to turn a high-dimensional parameter vector into a
low-dimensional scalar. Furthermore, Birkhoff designs a dedicated linear layer
operator, HyperLinear, to fuse decompression and matrix multiplication to
significantly accelerate inference of the compressed SAMs. Extensive
experiments on 18 SAMs in the COCO, LVIS, and SA-1B datasets show that Birkhoff
performs consistently and competitively in compression time, compression ratio,
post-compression performance, and inference speed. For example, Birkhoff can
achieve a compression ratio of 5.17x on SAM2-B, with less than 1% performance
drop without using any fine-tuning data. Moreover, the compression is finished
within 60 seconds for all models.

*Ahmed Farooq*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid model combining CNNs and a multi-well Hopfield network achieves 99.2% accuracy on MNIST by using deep features and energy-based classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address intraclass variability in handwritten digits and provide an interpretable framework for classification.

Method: Uses a CNN for feature extraction, k-means clustering for prototypes, and a Hopfield network for energy-based classification.

Result: Achieves 99.2% test accuracy on MNIST, demonstrating robustness and interpretability.

Conclusion: Deep feature extraction and prototype coverage are key to high performance, with potential for broader pattern recognition applications.

Abstract: This study presents a hybrid model for classifying handwritten digits in the
MNIST dataset, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a multi-well
Hopfield network. The approach employs a CNN to extract high-dimensional
features from input images, which are then clustered into class-specific
prototypes using k-means clustering. These prototypes serve as attractors in a
multi-well energy landscape, where a Hopfield network performs classification
by minimizing an energy function that balances feature similarity and class
assignment.The model's design enables robust handling of intraclass
variability, such as diverse handwriting styles, while providing an
interpretable framework through its energy-based decision process. Through
systematic optimization of the CNN architecture and the number of wells, the
model achieves a high test accuracy of 99.2% on 10,000 MNIST images,
demonstrating its effectiveness for image classification tasks. The findings
highlight the critical role of deep feature extraction and sufficient prototype
coverage in achieving high performance, with potential for broader applications
in pattern recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPart introduces a part-aware diffusion framework for 3D generation, addressing limitations of single-latent representations by decomposing objects into contextual part latents, enabling fine-grained control and part-level editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D generation methods struggle with capturing complex multi-part geometries, part independence, and fine-grained controllability, hindering compositional design.

Method: CoPart decomposes 3D objects into part latents, uses a mutual guidance strategy for joint denoising, and leverages the Partverse dataset for training.

Result: CoPart excels in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene composition with superior controllability.

Conclusion: CoPart advances 3D generation by enabling coherent multi-part generation and part-level conditioning, addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D generation have transitioned from multi-view 2D
rendering approaches to 3D-native latent diffusion frameworks that exploit
geometric priors in ground truth data. Despite progress, three key limitations
persist: (1) Single-latent representations fail to capture complex multi-part
geometries, causing detail degradation; (2) Holistic latent coding neglects
part independence and interrelationships critical for compositional design; (3)
Global conditioning mechanisms lack fine-grained controllability. Inspired by
human 3D design workflows, we propose CoPart - a part-aware diffusion framework
that decomposes 3D objects into contextual part latents for coherent multi-part
generation. This paradigm offers three advantages: i) Reduces encoding
complexity through part decomposition; ii) Enables explicit part relationship
modeling; iii) Supports part-level conditioning. We further develop a mutual
guidance strategy to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models for joint part
latent denoising, ensuring both geometric coherence and foundation model
priors. To enable large-scale training, we construct Partverse - a novel 3D
part dataset derived from Objaverse through automated mesh segmentation and
human-verified annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoPart's superior
capabilities in part-level editing, articulated object generation, and scene
composition with unprecedented controllability.

*Zhengqing Wang,Yuefan Wu,Jiacheng Chen,Fuyang Zhang,Yasutaka Furukawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural rendering method using compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs) for efficient scene representation and rendering, balancing quality, speed, and data size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable compute-efficient rendering while retaining rich scene details and allowing flexible token adjustments for novel views.

Method: Uses a multi-view encoder, latent-space K-means for token reduction, and a condenser to compress tokens into CLiFTs. A compute-adaptive renderer synthesizes novel views.

Result: Achieves significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the highest overall score on RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets.

Conclusion: CLiFTs offer a scalable, efficient solution for neural rendering with trade-offs in data size, quality, and speed.

Abstract: This paper proposes a neural rendering approach that represents a scene as
"compressed light-field tokens (CLiFTs)", retaining rich appearance and
geometric information of a scene. CLiFT enables compute-efficient rendering by
compressed tokens, while being capable of changing the number of tokens to
represent a scene or render a novel view with one trained network. Concretely,
given a set of images, multi-view encoder tokenizes the images with the camera
poses. Latent-space K-means selects a reduced set of rays as cluster centroids
using the tokens. The multi-view ``condenser'' compresses the information of
all the tokens into the centroid tokens to construct CLiFTs. At test time,
given a target view and a compute budget (i.e., the number of CLiFTs), the
system collects the specified number of nearby tokens and synthesizes a novel
view using a compute-adaptive renderer. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K
and DL3DV datasets quantitatively and qualitatively validate our approach,
achieving significant data reduction with comparable rendering quality and the
highest overall rendering score, while providing trade-offs of data size,
rendering quality, and rendering speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lumos-1 is an autoregressive video generator that adapts LLM architecture with minimal changes, using MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal correlations and AR-DF for balanced frame-wise loss. It achieves competitive performance with efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing autoregressive video generators, such as divergence from LLM architectures, dependency on bulky encoders, or high latency.

Method: Introduces MM-RoPE for spatiotemporal correlations and AR-DF for balanced loss. Uses a token dependency strategy and efficient training techniques.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to EMU3, COSMOS-Video2World, and OpenSoraPlan on benchmarks.

Conclusion: Lumos-1 offers an efficient and effective solution for autoregressive video generation, with minimal architectural changes and competitive results.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have unified a vast range of
language tasks, inspiring preliminary efforts in autoregressive video
generation. Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from
standard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur
prohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce
Lumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture
with minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations
in LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its
imbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE
scheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive
frequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal
spatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy
that obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.
Based on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss
imbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing
Autoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal
tube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to
avoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we
pre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on
GenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V. Code

Abstract: We present Audio Flamingo 3 (AF3), a fully open state-of-the-art (SOTA) large
audio-language model that advances reasoning and understanding across speech,
sound, and music. AF3 introduces: (i) AF-Whisper, a unified audio encoder
trained using a novel strategy for joint representation learning across all 3

allowing the model to do chain-of-thought-type reasoning before answering;
(iii) multi-turn, multi-audio chat; (iv) long audio understanding and reasoning
(including speech) up to 10 minutes; and (v) voice-to-voice interaction. To
enable these capabilities, we propose several large-scale training datasets
curated using novel strategies, including AudioSkills-XL, LongAudio-XL,

TL;DR: The study evaluates modern language identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods using mid-20th century radio recordings, highlighting strengths in LID but fragility in SR due to biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the robustness of LID and SR methods with multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings, addressing challenges in archival speaker indexing.

Method: Leveraged UNESCO's radio recordings to test off-the-shelf LID (e.g., Whisper) and SR methods, focusing on multilingual and cross-age speech.

Result: LID systems handle second-language and accented speech well, but SR embeddings are biased by channel, age, and language factors.

Conclusion: SR methods need improvement to overcome biases for reliable use in speaker indexing for archives.

Abstract: In this study, we leverage a unique UNESCO collection of mid-20th century
radio recordings to probe the robustness of modern off-the-shelf language
identification (LID) and speaker recognition (SR) methods, especially with
respect to the impact of multilingual speakers and cross-age recordings. Our
findings suggest that LID systems, such as Whisper, are increasingly adept at
handling second-language and accented speech. However, speaker embeddings
remain a fragile component of speech processing pipelines that is prone to
biases related to the channel, age, and language. Issues which will need to be
overcome should archives aim to employ SR methods for speaker indexing.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset for analyzing finfluencers' impact on stock recommendations. It benchmarks MLLMs and LLMs, showing multimodal inputs improve ticker extraction but struggle with distinguishing investment actions and conviction. Betting against finfluencer recommendations outperforms the S&P 500 but with higher risk.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the influence of finfluencers on stock recommendations through multimodal signals like tone and facial expressions, beyond traditional text-based analysis.

Method: Created VideoConviction, a dataset with 6,000+ expert annotations from 457 hours of human effort, to benchmark MLLMs and LLMs in financial discourse.

Result: Multimodal inputs improve ticker extraction but models struggle with distinguishing conviction. Betting against finfluencer recommendations yields 6.8% higher annual returns than the S&P 500 but with greater risk.

Conclusion: The benchmark enables diverse evaluation of multimodal tasks, advancing financial research. The dataset and code are available under CC BY-NC 4.0.

Abstract: Social media has amplified the reach of financial influencers known as
"finfluencers," who share stock recommendations on platforms like YouTube.
Understanding their influence requires analyzing multimodal signals like tone,
delivery style, and facial expressions, which extend beyond text-based
financial analysis. We introduce VideoConviction, a multimodal dataset with
6,000+ expert annotations, produced through 457 hours of human effort, to
benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and text-based large
language models (LLMs) in financial discourse. Our results show that while
multimodal inputs improve stock ticker extraction (e.g., extracting Apple's
ticker AAPL), both MLLMs and LLMs struggle to distinguish investment actions
and conviction--the strength of belief conveyed through confident delivery and
detailed reasoning--often misclassifying general commentary as definitive
recommendations. While high-conviction recommendations perform better than
low-conviction ones, they still underperform the popular S\&P 500 index fund.
An inverse strategy--betting against finfluencer recommendations--outperforms
the S\&P 500 by 6.8\% in annual returns but carries greater risk (Sharpe ratio
of 0.41 vs. 0.65). Our benchmark enables a diverse evaluation of multimodal
tasks, comparing model performance on both full video and segmented video
inputs. This enables deeper advancements in multimodal financial research. Our
code, dataset, and evaluation leaderboard are available under the CC BY-NC 4.0

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: PUMA proposes a layer-pruned MLLM with modality-adaptive learning for efficient unified multimodal retrieval, reducing resource use without sacrificing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for efficient unified multimodal retrieval (UMR) due to high training costs and low inference efficiency of existing MLLMs.

Method: Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation for structural efficiency and Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss (MAC-Loss) for enhanced learning.

Result: Significant reduction in resource usage while maintaining strong performance.

Conclusion: PUMA effectively addresses efficiency issues in UMR with innovative structural and learning approaches.

Abstract: As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval
(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large
parameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To
address this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient
Unified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach
improves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,
we propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only
shallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher
signals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)
On the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss
(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and
easier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different
temperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our
method significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong
performance.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to bridge the gap between image and text modalities for image-text matching (ITM). It introduces Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD) for better alignment and shows improved performance on benchmarks like Flickr30K and MSCOCO, with strong zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning visual and textual modalities is challenging due to their inherent differences. The paper aims to bridge this gap using MLLMs to enhance cross-modal alignment.

Method: The framework uses MLLMs to generate VSD for semantic parsing. It combines instance-level alignment (fusing visual features with VSD) and prototype-level alignment (VSD clustering) to improve ITM.

Result: Experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO show significant performance improvements. The method also generalizes well to cross-domain tasks like news and remote sensing ITM.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the modality gap in ITM, demonstrating strong performance and generalization, with code and models publicly available.

Abstract: Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of
aligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their
representations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,
structured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by
leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.
By generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic
anchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)
Instance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the
linguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level
alignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These
modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive
experiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance
improvements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to
cross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM. The code and model
checkpoints are available at https://github.com/Image-Text-Matching/VSD.

reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data
pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start
fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning
trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic
multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts
between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive
signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows
M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks,
showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.

Conclusion: The approach enhances information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, potentially reducing the diagnostic odyssey for rare-disease patients.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare,
rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient
knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained
clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity
sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four
complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback
strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph
(taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date
context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09,
ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89
approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms
improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Millions of un-georeferenced biological samples require efficient, automated solutions due to the labor-intensive nature of manual georeferencing.

Method: The approach uses LMMs to visually contextualize spatial relations in locality descriptions via a grid-based zero-shot setting.

Result: Experiments show ~1 km average distance error, surpassing uni-modal methods and existing tools.

Conclusion: The method's success suggests practical integration into georeferencing workflows, leveraging LMMs' map comprehension.

Abstract: Millions of biological sample records collected in the last few centuries
archived in natural history collections are un-georeferenced. Georeferencing
complex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a
highly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the
existing automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for
georeferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and
results of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent
Large Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually
contextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a
grid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a
zero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated
dataset show impressive results for our approach ($\sim$1 km Average distance
error) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and
existing georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the
experiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.
Motivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this
method into a georeferencing workflow.

Method: Leveraged MS MARCO datasets with human-annotated labels, refreshed collections, and compared single-stage vs. multistage retrieval pipelines.

Result: Deep neural models outperformed traditional methods, but single-stage retrieval lagged behind multistage pipelines. Data refresh raised concerns about label quality and judgment completeness.

Conclusion: While neural models show promise, challenges in data quality and retrieval methods need addressing for further improvements.

Abstract: This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,
we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human
annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking
tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage
collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document
collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage
collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig
continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found
that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although
they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally,
the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some
questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training
labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we
discuss in this report.

*Aleksei Ilin,Gor Matevosyan,Xueying Ma,Vladimir Eremin,Suhaa Dada,Muqun Li,Riyaaz Shaik,Haluk Noyan Tokgozoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight safety guardrail framework for language models uses synthetic data and adversarial training to enable small models to outperform larger ones in content moderation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational overhead while improving content moderation performance and resilience against adversarial attacks.

Method: High-fidelity synthetic data generation from human-curated seeds, query augmentation, paraphrasing, and adversarial training with reinforcement learning.

Result: Small language models (SLMs) achieve or surpass larger models in content moderation tasks, offering scalability and efficiency.

Conclusion: The framework provides a scalable, efficient solution for AI content moderation, leveraging small models effectively.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight yet highly effective safety guardrail framework
for language models, demonstrating that small-scale language models can
achieve, and even surpass, the performance of larger counterparts in content
moderation tasks. This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data
generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process
begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and
paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented
data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity
and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement
learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples.
These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its
ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate
strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the
capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative
models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse,
high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs)
to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces
computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial
attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in
AI systems.

### [136] [Scaling Attention to Very Long Sequences in Linear Time with Wavelet-Enhanced Random Spectral Attention (WERSA)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08637)
*Vincenzo Dentamaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WERSA introduces a linear-time attention mechanism for transformers, improving efficiency and accuracy on long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the computational inefficiency of quadratic attention in transformers for long sequences.

Method: Combines random spectral features, Haar wavelets, and learnable parameters for selective attention.

Result: Achieves best accuracy across benchmarks, reduces training time by 81%, and handles extremely long sequences where others fail.

Conclusion: WERSA enables practical, efficient long-context models, especially for low-resource hardware.

Abstract: Transformer models are computationally costly on long sequences since regular
attention has quadratic $O(n^2)$ time complexity. We introduce Wavelet-Enhanced
Random Spectral Attention (WERSA), a novel mechanism of linear $O(n)$ time
complexity that is pivotal to enable successful long-sequence processing
without the performance trade-off. WERSA merges content-adaptive random
spectral features together with multi-resolution Haar wavelets and learnable
parameters to selectively attend to informative scales of data while preserving
linear efficiency.
  Large-scale comparisons \textbf{on single GPU} and across various benchmarks
(vision, NLP, hierarchical reasoning) and various attention mechanisms (like
Multiheaded Attention, Flash-Attention-2, FNet, Linformer, Performer,
Waveformer), reveal uniform advantages of WERSA. It achieves best accuracy in
all tests. On ArXiv classification, WERSA improves accuracy over vanilla
attention by 1.2\% (86.2\% vs 85.0\%) while cutting training time by 81\% (296s
vs 1554s) and FLOPS by 73.4\% (26.2G vs 98.4G). Significantly, WERSA excels
where vanilla and FlashAttention-2 fail: on ArXiv-128k's extremely lengthy
sequences, it achieves best accuracy (79.1\%) and AUC (0.979) among viable
methods, operating on data that gives Out-Of-Memory errors to quadratic methods
while being \textbf{twice as fast} as Waveformer, its next-best competitor.
  By significantly reducing computational loads without compromising accuracy,
WERSA makes possible more practical, more affordable, long-context models, in
particular on low-resource hardware, for more sustainable and more scalable AI
development.

*Chenyang Song,Weilin Zhao,Xu Han,Chaojun Xiao,Yingfa Chen,Yuxuan Li,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlockFFN introduces a novel MoE architecture with differentiable routing and CLS-aware training to improve sparsity and acceleration, outperforming baselines with 80% TLS and 70% CLS, achieving 3.67× speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inflexible routing and low chunk-level sparsity of vanilla MoE, which hinders performance and acceleration, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Proposes BlockFFN with ReLU-RMSNorm routing, CLS-aware training objectives, and efficient kernels combining sparsity and speculative decoding.

Result: Achieves 80% token-level sparsity (TLS) and 70% 8-token chunk-level sparsity (CLS), with 3.67× speedup on end-side devices.

Conclusion: BlockFFN enhances MoE performance and acceleration, making it suitable for low-resource environments.

Abstract: To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),
architectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts
(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and
inflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each
token activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures
exhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple
consecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity
pattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,
end-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques
(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
MoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment
techniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and
RMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both
token-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training
objectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,
we implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and
speculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate
the superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over
80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\times$ speedup on
real end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are
available publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).

*Yulai Zhao,Haolin Liu,Dian Yu,S. Y. Kung,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

TL;DR: Generative reward models (LLMs-as-judges) are vulnerable to superficial manipulations, leading to false positives. A robust model and data augmentation strategy are introduced to address this.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To highlight vulnerabilities in generative reward models used for evaluating answer quality in RLVR and propose solutions.

Method: Demonstrates vulnerabilities across LLMs, datasets, and prompts, then introduces a data augmentation strategy to train a robust reward model.

Result: The new model shows improved robustness against superficial manipulations.

Conclusion: Urgent need for reliable LLM-based evaluation methods; a robust reward model and synthetic data are released.

Abstract: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large
language models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred
over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving
free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a
candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward
indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,
we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to
superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning
openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step."
can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is
widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat
for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as
rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,
we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new
generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings
highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We
release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data

*Parag Dutta,Ambedkar Dukkipati*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces LoGIC, a multi-agent reinforcement learning game for unsupervised image captioning, achieving improved performance without additional labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing labeled datasets are exhausted for training Vision Language Models (VLMs), necessitating exploration of unsupervised methods for performance improvement.

Method: Proposes LoGIC with two agents (speaker and listener) trained using GRPO algorithm. Uses pre-trained VLMs and LLMs, and lightweight components (ViT and GPT2) for training from scratch.

Result: Achieves 46 BLEU score with pre-trained models (2 points higher than vanilla VLM) and 31 BLEU score with lightweight components (10 points higher than existing unsupervised methods).

Conclusion: LoGIC effectively improves unsupervised image captioning performance, demonstrating the potential of multi-agent reinforcement learning in this domain.

Abstract: Image captioning is an important problem in developing various AI systems,
and these tasks require large volumes of annotated images to train the models.
Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large
Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the
performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the
unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively
under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for
Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed
method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective
of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents
in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that
improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the
agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the
'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the
'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without
additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the
$44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the
'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii)
a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining
a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over
existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional SHACL validation engines produce terse, English-only reports, which are hard for non-technical users to understand and act upon.

Method: Combines rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs) to create detailed, human-readable explanations. Uses a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations.

Result: Produces detailed, multilingual explanations for SHACL constraint violations, enhancing interpretability and usability.

Conclusion: xpSHACL effectively addresses the interpretability gap in SHACL validation, making it more accessible to non-technical users.

Abstract: Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) is a powerful language for validating RDF
data. Given the recent industry attention to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), more users
need to validate linked data properly. However, traditional SHACL validation
engines often provide terse reports in English that are difficult for
non-technical users to interpret and act upon. This paper presents xpSHACL, an
explainable SHACL validation system that addresses this issue by combining
rule-based justification trees with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and
large language models (LLMs) to produce detailed, multilanguage, human-readable
explanations for constraint violations. A key feature of xpSHACL is its usage
of a Violation KG to cache and reuse explanations, improving efficiency and

*Wenbo Cui,Chengyang Zhao,Yuhui Chen,Haoran Li,Zhizheng Zhang,Dongbin Zhao,He Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CL3R is a 3D pre-training framework for robotic manipulation, combining spatial awareness and semantic understanding to improve visuomotor policy learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods using 2D foundation models lack 3D spatial information and struggle with diverse camera viewpoints, limiting policy effectiveness in fine-grained manipulation.

Method: CL3R integrates a point cloud Masked Autoencoder for 3D representations and uses contrastive learning with pre-trained 2D models for semantic transfer. It also unifies coordinate systems and fuses multi-view point clouds to enhance generalization.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show CL3R's superiority in robust perception and policy learning.

Conclusion: CL3R effectively addresses 3D spatial and semantic challenges, improving robotic manipulation policies across diverse viewpoints.

Abstract: Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: H2RH-SGS learns robot handovers from RGB images using Gaussian Splatting, avoiding real-robot training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the visual domain gap between simulation and real-world for robot manipulation tasks.

Method: Uses sparse-view Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct handover scenes, generating robot demonstrations from image-action pairs.

Result: Successfully trained and deployed a robot policy for handovers with 16 household objects.

Conclusion: H2RH-SGS is an effective representation for human-to-robot handover tasks.

Abstract: Learning robot manipulation policies from raw, real-world image data requires
a large number of robot-action trials in the physical environment. Although
training using simulations offers a cost-effective alternative, the visual
domain gap between simulation and robot workspace remains a major limitation.
Gaussian Splatting visual reconstruction methods have recently provided new
directions for robot manipulation by generating realistic environments. In this
paper, we propose the first method for learning supervised-based robot
handovers solely from RGB images without the need of real-robot training or
real-robot data collection. The proposed policy learner, Human-to-Robot
Handover using Sparse-View Gaussian Splatting (H2RH-SGS), leverages sparse-view
Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes to generate
robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a camera
mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose changes in
the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose changes.
We train a robot policy on demonstrations collected with 16 household objects
and {\em directly} deploy this policy in the real environment. Experiments in
both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and real-world human-to-robot
handover experiments demonstrate that H2RH-SGS serves as a new and effective
representation for the human-to-robot handover task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of previous work relying on mouse movements and self-reported labels, which are prone to inaccuracies and biases.

Method: Used eye-tracking to collect continuous visual attention data from 47 participants for 2,776 queries, including HTML, screenshots, eye/mouse movements, and ad bounding boxes.

Result: Comprehensive dataset with baseline experiments for classification tasks, enabling future research.

Conclusion: The dataset provides an objective foundation for studying SERP behavior, with potential for diverse future applications.

Abstract: We contribute a comprehensive dataset to study user attention and purchasing
behavior on Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Previous work has relied on
mouse movements as a low-cost large-scale behavioral proxy but also has relied
on self-reported ground-truth labels, collected at post-task, which can be
inaccurate and prone to biases. To address this limitation, we use an eye
tracker to construct an objective ground-truth of continuous visual attention.
Our dataset comprises 2,776 transactional queries on Google SERPs, collected
from 47 participants, and includes: (1) HTML source files, with CSS and images;
(2) rendered SERP screenshots; (3) eye movement data; (4) mouse movement data;

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing submovement analysis methods face challenges like reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and validation due to limited labeled data.

Method: Uses a semi-supervised framework with synthetic data (based on minimum-jerk principles) refined by unlabeled human movement data, employing a fully convolutional architecture.

Result: Surpasses existing methods in accuracy and speed (less than a millisecond per input second), robust in high-noise conditions.

Conclusion: Enables new applications in human-computer interaction, rehabilitation, and motor control studies, with public code and model weights available.

Abstract: This paper introduces a SSSUMO, semi-supervised deep learning approach for
submovement decomposition that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and speed.
While submovement analysis offers valuable insights into motor control,
existing methods struggle with reconstruction accuracy, computational cost, and
validation, due to the difficulty of obtaining hand-labeled data. We address
these challenges using a semi-supervised learning framework. This framework
learns from synthetic data, initially generated from minimum-jerk principles
and then iteratively refined through adaptation to unlabeled human movement
data. Our fully convolutional architecture with differentiable reconstruction
significantly surpasses existing methods on both synthetic and diverse human
motion datasets, demonstrating robustness even in high-noise conditions.
Crucially, the model operates in real-time (less than a millisecond per input
second), a substantial improvement over optimization-based techniques. This
enhanced performance facilitates new applications in human-computer
interaction, rehabilitation medicine, and motor control studies. We demonstrate
the model's effectiveness across diverse human-performed tasks such as
steering, rotation, pointing, object moving, handwriting, and mouse-controlled
gaming, showing notable improvements particularly on challenging datasets where
traditional methods largely fail. Training and benchmarking source code, along

TL;DR: FlowDrag improves drag-based editing by leveraging geometric information for accurate transformations, outperforming existing methods on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drag-based editing methods suffer from geometric inconsistency, focusing only on user-defined points and neglecting broader geometry, leading to artifacts.

Method: FlowDrag constructs a 3D mesh from the image, uses an energy function for deformation guided by user-defined points, and projects displacements into 2D for UNet denoising.

Result: FlowDrag achieves precise handle-to-target alignment while preserving structural integrity and outperforms existing methods on VFD and DragBench.

Conclusion: FlowDrag addresses geometric inconsistency in drag-based editing and introduces the VFD benchmark for accurate evaluation, demonstrating superior performance.

Abstract: Drag-based editing allows precise object manipulation through point-based
control, offering user convenience. However, current methods often suffer from
a geometric inconsistency problem by focusing exclusively on matching
user-defined points, neglecting the broader geometry and leading to artifacts
or unstable edits. We propose FlowDrag, which leverages geometric information
for more accurate and coherent transformations. Our approach constructs a 3D
mesh from the image, using an energy function to guide mesh deformation based
on user-defined drag points. The resulting mesh displacements are projected
into 2D and incorporated into a UNet denoising process, enabling precise
handle-to-target point alignment while preserving structural integrity.
Additionally, existing drag-editing benchmarks provide no ground truth, making
it difficult to assess how accurately the edits match the intended
transformations. To address this, we present VFD (VidFrameDrag) benchmark
dataset, which provides ground-truth frames using consecutive shots in a video
dataset. FlowDrag outperforms existing drag-based editing methods on both VFD
Bench and DragBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack diverse camera-object relations in training data, limiting their accuracy in tasks like object orientation and camera viewpoint recognition.

Method: A synthetic generation pipeline uses 3D assets, rendering, diffusion-based image generation, and LLMs to create photorealistic images with precise camera-object relations. The dataset, Ultimate3D, includes 240K VQAs with annotations.

Result: MLLMs fine-tuned on Ultimate3D outperform commercial models by 33.4% in camera-object relation recognition.

Conclusion: The proposed dataset and benchmark enhance MLLM performance and have broad applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with accurately capturing
camera-object relations, especially for object orientation, camera viewpoint,
and camera shots. This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on
images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual
descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to
create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D
assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models
to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations.
Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts
for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We
create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object
annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed
dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average
accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our
code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.

TL;DR: The study explores MS-LiDAR data for forest segmentation using deep learning and machine learning models, finding KPConv most accurate with multispectral features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forest inventory is labor-intensive; MS-LiDAR offers a remote, efficient solution for detailed forest segmentation.

Method: Used HeliALS MS-LiDAR data and tested four models (KPConv, Superpoint Transformer, Point Transformer V3, Random Forest) with geometric and spectral features.

Result: KPConv outperformed others; using all three wavelengths improved mIoU by 33.73% and mAcc by 32.35%.

Conclusion: MS-LiDAR enhances automated forest segmentation accuracy, proving its potential for forest inventory.

Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate
regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning
systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote
and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and
time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR
systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral
information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the
biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component
segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial
and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving
precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the
potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing
high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components:
ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three
point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including
kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and
random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy
of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature
vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all
three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into
the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean
intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This
study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving
the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Siamese network-based method for histopathological WSI analysis, addressing limitations of permutation-invariant MIL by learning to restore instance order, termed 'instance jigsaw puzzle.'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Permutation-invariant MIL limits uncovering semantic correlations in WSIs; spatial correlations are more effective.

Method: Proposes a Siamese network to solve instance jigsaw puzzles, justified by optimal transport theory.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art MIL methods in WSI classification and survival prediction.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures semantic correlations, offering a superior alternative to traditional MIL.

Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach
for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on
permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover
semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and
theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not
permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances
can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a
novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the
order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task
as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations
between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we
propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by
optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification
and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent
state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) for segment-specific quantification of intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC), achieving high accuracy and robustness in landmark localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for ICAC volume measurement ignore plaque location's critical influence, and finer-grained segment-specific quantification has been technically infeasible.

Method: The DST framework reformulates 3D ICAC analysis as a 1D axial task, processing full-resolution CT volumes as 2D slice sequences to predict key anatomical landmarks.

Result: The DST achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 0.1 slices, with 96% predictions within ±1 slice tolerance, and sets a benchmark on the Clean-CC-CCII classification.

Conclusion: The DST provides the first practical tool for automated segment-specific ICAC analysis, enabling further studies on location-specific biomarkers.

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an
established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric
ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in
different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a
finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically
infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or
isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical
ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we
reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark
Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the
\textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes
full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$
independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks.
Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated
on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%}
of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to
validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result
on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end
evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated
segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation
for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis,
prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction) is a train-free method for generating embeddings for volumetric medical data using a frozen 2D foundation model and random projections, outperforming state-of-the-art methods without costly training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in training foundational models for volumetric imaging data (e.g., MRI) due to computational complexity and dataset curation.

Method: Uses a frozen 2D foundation model to extract visual tokens from cross-sections, compresses them with random projections to reduce computational complexity.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods (+3% to +14% on various tasks) without training.

Conclusion: Raptor is effective and versatile for advancing deep learning in medical volumetric data.

Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging
data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational
complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and
curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges,
we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for
generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a
frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual
tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then
spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing
computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive
experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance
of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively
on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14%
SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results
highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for
advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.
