### [1] [A Unifying Scheme for Extractive Content Selection Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16922)
*Shmuel Amar,Ori Shapira,Aviv Slobodkin,Ido Dagan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified framework called instruction-guided content selection (IGCS) for NLP tasks that involve selecting relevant text spans from source texts, introduces a benchmark and synthetic dataset, and demonstrates improved performance through transfer learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Content selection tasks in NLP have traditionally been studied in isolation with different modeling approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics, despite sharing the common objective of selecting relevant text spans from source texts. There is a need for a unified framework to address these tasks collectively.

Method: The authors propose instruction-guided content selection (IGCS) as a unified framework where task definitions and instance-specific requests are encapsulated as instructions to a language model. They introduce IGCSBench as the first unified benchmark and create a large generic synthetic dataset for diverse content selection tasks.

Result: Transfer learning with the synthetic datasets often boosts performance across various content selection tasks, regardless of whether dedicated training data is available for the specific target task. The framework successfully addresses generic inference time issues in LLM-based content selection modeling.

Conclusion: The IGCS framework provides a beneficial unified approach for content selection tasks, with the introduced benchmark, synthetic dataset, and methods demonstrating utility for future content selection models. The resources and methods show promise for improving performance across diverse content selection applications.

Abstract: A broad range of NLP tasks involve selecting relevant text spans from given
source texts. Despite this shared objective, such \textit{content selection}
tasks have traditionally been studied in isolation, each with its own modeling
approaches, datasets, and evaluation metrics. In this work, we propose
\textit{instruction-guided content selection (IGCS)} as a beneficial unified
framework for such settings, where the task definition and any
instance-specific request are encapsulated as instructions to a language model.
To promote this framework, we introduce \igcsbench{}, the first unified
benchmark covering diverse content selection tasks. Further, we create a large
generic synthetic dataset that can be leveraged for diverse content selection
tasks, and show that transfer learning with these datasets often boosts
performance, whether dedicated training for the targeted task is available or
not. Finally, we address generic inference time issues that arise in LLM-based
modeling of content selection, assess a generic evaluation metric, and overall
propose the utility of our resources and methods for future content selection
models. Models and datasets available at https://github.com/shmuelamar/igcs.

*Robert Korom,Sarah Kiptinness,Najib Adan,Kassim Said,Catherine Ithuli,Oliver Rotich,Boniface Kimani,Irene King'ori,Stellah Kamau,Elizabeth Atemba,Muna Aden,Preston Bowman,Michael Sharman,Rebecca Soskin Hicks,Rebecca Distler,Johannes Heidecke,Rahul K. Arora,Karan Singhal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study evaluated AI Consult, an LLM-based clinical decision support tool, in 15 primary care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, finding it reduced diagnostic errors by 16% and treatment errors by 13% across 39,849 patient visits, with all participating clinicians reporting improved care quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate the real-world impact of large language model-based clinical decision support systems on reducing clinical errors and improving care quality in live healthcare settings, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

Method: Conducted a quality improvement study across 15 Penda Health clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, comparing 39,849 patient visits with and without AI Consult access. Independent physicians rated visits to identify clinical errors, and clinicians were surveyed about their experience with the tool. AI Consult was designed to integrate into existing workflows while preserving clinician autonomy.

Result: Clinicians using AI Consult made 16% fewer diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors compared to those without access. The tool would prevent approximately 22,000 diagnostic errors and 29,000 treatment errors annually at Penda Health alone. All surveyed clinicians reported improved care quality, with 75% describing the improvement as "substantial".

Conclusion: LLM-based clinical decision support tools like AI Consult can significantly reduce clinical errors in real-world healthcare settings when properly implemented with workflow alignment and active deployment strategies. The study provides a practical framework for responsible adoption of AI in clinical practice.

Abstract: We evaluate the impact of large language model-based clinical decision
support in live care. In partnership with Penda Health, a network of primary
care clinics in Nairobi, Kenya, we studied AI Consult, a tool that serves as a
safety net for clinicians by identifying potential documentation and clinical
decision-making errors. AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows,
activating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a
quality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits
performed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics.
Visits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors.
Clinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer
diagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the
introduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and
treatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of
clinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the
quality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was "substantial".
These results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation
and active deployment to encourage clinician uptake. We hope this study
demonstrates the potential for LLM-based clinical decision support tools to
reduce errors in real-world settings and provides a practical framework for
advancing responsible adoption.

### [3] [Harnessing RLHF for Robust Unanswerability Recognition and Trustworthy Response Generation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16951)
*Shuyuan Lin,Lei Duan,Philip Hughes,Yuxuan Sheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SALU (Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability), a novel approach that integrates unanswerability detection directly into LLMs to prevent hallucinated responses in conversational information retrieval systems by training the model to recognize when it should abstain from answering questions it cannot reliably answer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conversational Information Retrieval systems face a critical challenge in reliably handling unanswerable questions to prevent generating misleading or hallucinated content. Traditional approaches using external classifiers create inconsistencies with core generative LLMs, necessitating a more integrated solution that can teach LLMs to recognize their knowledge boundaries.

Method: SALU uses a multi-task learning framework that trains LLMs for both standard Question Answering and explicit abstention generation for unanswerable queries. The key innovation is a confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase that explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of the model's knowledge boundaries.

Result: SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines, including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly answering or abstaining from questions on the custom-built C-IR_Answerability dataset. Human evaluation confirms SALU's superior reliability with high scores in factuality, appropriate abstention, and most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination rates.

Conclusion: SALU successfully demonstrates the ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'" by integrating unanswerability detection directly within the LLM's generative process, providing a more reliable and consistent approach to handling unanswerable questions in conversational information retrieval systems compared to traditional external classifier methods.

Abstract: Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) systems, while offering intuitive
access to information, face a significant challenge: reliably handling
unanswerable questions to prevent the generation of misleading or hallucinated
content. Traditional approaches often rely on external classifiers, which can
introduce inconsistencies with the core generative Large Language Models
(LLMs). This paper introduces Self-Aware LLM for Unanswerability (SALU), a
novel approach that deeply integrates unanswerability detection directly within
the LLM's generative process. SALU is trained using a multi-task learning
framework for both standard Question Answering (QA) and explicit abstention
generation for unanswerable queries. Crucially, it incorporates a
confidence-score-guided reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)
phase, which explicitly penalizes hallucinated responses and rewards
appropriate abstentions, fostering intrinsic self-awareness of knowledge
boundaries. Through extensive experiments on our custom-built
C-IR_Answerability dataset, SALU consistently outperforms strong baselines,
including hybrid LLM-classifier systems, in overall accuracy for correctly
answering or abstaining from questions. Human evaluation further confirms
SALU's superior reliability, achieving high scores in factuality, appropriate
abstention, and, most importantly, a dramatic reduction in hallucination,
demonstrating its ability to robustly "know when to say 'I don't know'."

### [4] [Text-to-SPARQL Goes Beyond English: Multilingual Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs through Human-Inspired Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16971)
*Aleksandr Perevalov,Andreas Both*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: mKGQAgent is a human-inspired framework that uses coordinated LLM agents to convert multilingual natural language questions into SPARQL queries through modular subtasks, achieving first place in the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accessing knowledge through multilingual natural-language interfaces is challenging in information retrieval. Existing approaches that combine components for downstream tasks lack interpretability and efficiency in converting natural language to structured queries like SPARQL.

Method: The paper introduces mKGQAgent, a framework that decomposes natural language to SPARQL conversion into modular, interpretable subtasks using coordinated LLM agent workflow for planning, entity linking, and query refinement, guided by an experience pool for in-context learning.

Result: mKGQAgent achieved first place among participants in the Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, evaluated on DBpedia-based and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks, demonstrating efficient handling of multilingual knowledge graph question answering.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates that human-inspired modular reasoning can effectively solve multilingual semantic parsing tasks, opening new avenues for developing human-like reasoning systems in multilingual knowledge graph question answering.

Abstract: Accessing knowledge via multilingual natural-language interfaces is one of
the emerging challenges in the field of information retrieval and related ones.
Structured knowledge stored in knowledge graphs can be queried via a specific
query language (e.g., SPARQL). Therefore, one needs to transform
natural-language input into a query to fulfill an information need. Prior
approaches mostly focused on combining components (e.g., rule-based or
neural-based) that solve downstream tasks and come up with an answer at the
end. We introduce mKGQAgent, a human-inspired framework that breaks down the
task of converting natural language questions into SPARQL queries into modular,
interpretable subtasks. By leveraging a coordinated LLM agent workflow for
planning, entity linking, and query refinement - guided by an experience pool
for in-context learning - mKGQAgent efficiently handles multilingual KGQA.
Evaluated on the DBpedia- and Corporate-based KGQA benchmarks within the
Text2SPARQL challenge 2025, our approach took first place among the other
participants. This work opens new avenues for developing human-like reasoning
systems in multilingual semantic parsing.

### [5] [Leveraging Synthetic Data for Question Answering with Multilingual LLMs in the Agricultural Domain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16974)
*Rishemjit Kaur,Arshdeep Singh Bhankhar,Surangika Ranathunga,Jashanpreet Singh Salh,Sudhir Rajput,Vidhi,Kashish Mahendra,Bhavika Berwal,Ritesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study improves agricultural Question Answering systems by creating multilingual synthetic datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs, resulting in better factual accuracy and relevance compared to general-purpose models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose LLMs provide generic agricultural advisories lacking precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific datasets. Farmers need accurate agriculture-related information in their native languages for agricultural success.

Method: Generated multilingual synthetic agricultural datasets from agriculture-specific documents in English, Hindi, and Punjabi, then fine-tuned language-specific LLMs using these synthetic datasets for improved agricultural Question Answering systems.

Result: Fine-tuned models demonstrated significant improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus compared to baseline general-purpose LLMs when evaluated on curated multilingual datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning is an effective strategy for improving LLM performance in agriculture, particularly in multilingual and low-resource settings. This approach enables more accurate and localized agricultural advisory services, helping bridge the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for diverse linguistic communities.

Abstract: Enabling farmers to access accurate agriculture-related information in their
native languages in a timely manner is crucial for the success of the
agriculture field. Although large language models (LLMs) can be used to
implement Question Answering (QA) systems, simply using publicly available
general-purpose LLMs in agriculture typically offer generic advisories, lacking
precision in local and multilingual contexts due to insufficient
domain-specific training and scarcity of high-quality, region-specific
datasets. Our study addresses these limitations by generating multilingual
synthetic agricultural datasets (English, Hindi, Punjabi) from
agriculture-specific documents and fine-tuning language-specific LLMs. Our
evaluation on curated multilingual datasets demonstrates significant
improvements in factual accuracy, relevance, and agricultural consensus for the
fine-tuned models compared to their baseline counterparts. These results
highlight the efficacy of synthetic data-driven, language-specific fine-tuning
as an effective strategy to improve the performance of LLMs in agriculture,
especially in multilingual and low-resource settings. By enabling more accurate
and localized agricultural advisory services, this study provides a meaningful
step toward bridging the knowledge gap in AI-driven agricultural solutions for
diverse linguistic communities.

### [6] [Obscured but Not Erased: Evaluating Nationality Bias in LLMs via Name-Based Bias Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16989)
*Giulio Pelosio,Devesh Batra,Noémie Bovey,Robert Hankache,Cristovao Iglesias,Greig Cowan,Raad Khraishi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a name-based benchmarking approach to investigate nationality bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) by substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, finding that smaller models exhibit more bias and lower accuracy than larger models, with biases proving resilient even when demographic markers are implicit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can exhibit latent biases towards specific nationalities even without explicit demographic markers. The authors wanted to investigate how substituting explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names (which better reflects real-world usage) affects bias and accuracy in LLMs from major providers.

Method: The researchers developed a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset, where they substituted explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names. They tested this across various LLMs from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, examining bias magnitude and accuracy in ambiguous contexts.

Result: Small models showed significantly more bias and lower accuracy than larger models. For example, Claude Haiku had 9% stereotypical bias versus 3.5% for Claude Sonnet, with Sonnet achieving 117.7% better accuracy. Smaller models also retained more existing errors in ambiguous contexts (GPT-4o-mini retained 76% of errors vs 68% for GPT-4o).

Conclusion: The research demonstrates the stubborn resilience of nationality biases in LLMs, particularly in smaller models. These findings have profound implications for AI system development and deployment in diverse, global contexts, highlighting the need for continued attention to bias mitigation strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can exhibit latent biases towards specific
nationalities even when explicit demographic markers are not present. In this
work, we introduce a novel name-based benchmarking approach derived from the
Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) dataset to investigate the impact of substituting
explicit nationality labels with culturally indicative names, a scenario more
reflective of real-world LLM applications. Our novel approach examines how this
substitution affects both bias magnitude and accuracy across a spectrum of LLMs
from industry leaders such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Our experiments
show that small models are less accurate and exhibit more bias compared to
their larger counterparts. For instance, on our name-based dataset and in the
ambiguous context (where the correct choice is not revealed), Claude Haiku
exhibited the worst stereotypical bias scores of 9%, compared to only 3.5% for
its larger counterpart, Claude Sonnet, where the latter also outperformed it by
117.7% in accuracy. Additionally, we find that small models retain a larger
portion of existing errors in these ambiguous contexts. For example, after
substituting names for explicit nationality references, GPT-4o retains 68% of
the error rate versus 76% for GPT-4o-mini, with similar findings for other
model providers, in the ambiguous context. Our research highlights the stubborn
resilience of biases in LLMs, underscoring their profound implications for the
development and deployment of AI systems in diverse, global contexts.

### [7] [Multi-Label Classification with Generative AI Models in Healthcare: A Case Study of Suicidality and Risk Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17009)
*Ming Huang,Zehan Li,Yan Hu,Wanjing Wang,Andrew Wen,Scott Lane,Salih Selek,Lokesh Shahani,Rodrigo Machado-Vieira,Jair Soares,Hua Xu,Hongfang Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study explores using generative large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5) for multi-label classification of suicidality-related factors from psychiatric electronic health records, developing a novel end-to-end pipeline that outperforms traditional binary classification approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a global health crisis affecting over 720,000 deaths annually. Early identification of suicidality-related factors (including suicide ideation, attempts, exposure, and self-injury) is critical for intervention, but existing AI approaches treat suicidality as binary classification, overlooking the complexity of co-occurring risk factors.

Method: The researchers developed a novel end-to-end generative multi-label classification pipeline using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5 models. They applied these models to psychiatric electronic health records and introduced advanced evaluation methods including label set level metrics and multilabel confusion matrices for comprehensive error analysis.

Result: Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved 0.94 partial match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score. GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior performance across label sets, particularly for rare or minority label sets, demonstrating more balanced and robust performance. The analysis revealed systematic error patterns like conflation of suicide ideation and attempts, and tendency toward cautious over-labeling.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks and provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured EHR data to support large-scale clinical research and evidence-based medicine. The multi-label approach better captures the complexity of suicidality-related factors compared to binary classification methods.

Abstract: Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths
annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide
attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs),
including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury
(NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied
AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary
classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors.
This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs),
specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs
from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to
end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods,
including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error
analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match
accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior
performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets,
indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal
systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight
the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only
demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical
classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured
EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine.

### [8] [Can External Validation Tools Improve Annotation Quality for LLM-as-a-Judge?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17015)
*Arduin Findeis,Floris Weers,Guoli Yin,Ke Ye,Ruoming Pang,Tom Gunter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a tool-using agentic system that augments AI annotators with web search and code execution capabilities to improve pairwise preference evaluation of LLM responses, particularly for factual, math, and code domains where standard annotation methods may be insufficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pairwise preference evaluation systems struggle with complex domains like long-form factual content, math, and code tasks, where annotators may focus on superficial qualities (like writing style) rather than accuracy, and where high-quality comparisons are difficult to obtain from both human and AI annotators.

Method: The authors develop a tool-using agentic system that enhances AI annotators with external validation tools including web search and code execution capabilities, allowing the system to ground evaluations in external sources rather than relying solely on the LLM's internal knowledge and potential biases.

Result: Extensive experiments across RewardBench (including AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, and three new datasets show that external tools can improve annotation performance in many cases, though not universally. The results also reveal sensitivity to simple parameters like prompts and highlight the need for better, non-saturated annotator benchmarks.

Conclusion: External tools can enhance AI annotator performance for challenging evaluation domains, but the approach is not universally superior and performance is sensitive to implementation details. The work emphasizes the need for improved evaluation benchmarks and demonstrates the potential of tool-augmented annotation systems for complex response evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate
and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative
model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the "better"
response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded
metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping
model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise
comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for
responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh
writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore
augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve
performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and
code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality
feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to
ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal
knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our
method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation
tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as
three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our
results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many,
but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity
of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved
(non-saturated) annotator benchmarks. We share our code at

### [9] [Evolutionary Feature-wise Thresholding for Binary Representation of NLP Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17025)
*Soumen Sinha,Shahryar Rahnamayan,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework to find optimal feature-specific thresholds for converting continuous text embeddings (like BERT) into binary representations, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy for NLP applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale NLP applications require efficient text embeddings due to storage and computational constraints. Traditional binary conversion methods use fixed thresholds across all features, which may not be optimal for preserving embedding quality and performance.

Method: The authors develop a Coordinate Search-based optimization framework that identifies optimal thresholds for each individual feature when converting continuous embeddings to binary representations (barcodes), rather than using a single fixed threshold for all features.

Result: Extensive experiments across different NLP tasks and datasets show that binary embeddings generated using optimal feature-specific thresholds outperform traditional binarization methods in accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully creates accurate and efficient binary text representations that enhance performance across various NLP features. The technique is versatile and can be applied beyond NLP embeddings to any features in machine learning applications, demonstrating broad applicability.

Abstract: Efficient text embedding is crucial for large-scale natural language
processing (NLP) applications, where storage and computational efficiency are
key concerns. In this paper, we explore how using binary representations
(barcodes) instead of real-valued features can be used for NLP embeddings
derived from machine learning models such as BERT. Thresholding is a common
method for converting continuous embeddings into binary representations, often
using a fixed threshold across all features. We propose a Coordinate
Search-based optimization framework that instead identifies the optimal
threshold for each feature, demonstrating that feature-specific thresholds lead
to improved performance in binary encoding. This ensures that the binary
representations are both accurate and efficient, enhancing performance across
various features. Our optimal barcode representations have shown promising
results in various NLP applications, demonstrating their potential to transform
text representation. We conducted extensive experiments and statistical tests
on different NLP tasks and datasets to evaluate our approach and compare it to
other thresholding methods. Binary embeddings generated using using optimal
thresholds found by our method outperform traditional binarization methods in
accuracy. This technique for generating binary representations is versatile and
can be applied to any features, not just limited to NLP embeddings, making it
useful for a wide range of domains in machine learning applications.

### [10] [CogDual: Enhancing Dual Cognition of LLMs via Reinforcement Learning with Implicit Rule-Based Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17147)
*Cheng Liu,Yifei Lu,Fanghua Ye,Jian Li,Xingyu Chen,Feiliang Ren,Zhaopeng Tu,Xiaolong Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogDual is a novel Role-Playing Language Agent that uses a cognize-then-respond reasoning paradigm, modeling both external situational awareness and internal self-awareness to improve character consistency and contextual alignment in role-playing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing Role-Playing Language Agents rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning but neglect the underlying cognitive mechanisms driving character behaviors, leading to suboptimal performance in character consistency and contextual alignment.

Method: CogDual adopts a cognize-then-respond reasoning paradigm inspired by cognitive psychology, jointly modeling external situational awareness and internal self-awareness. The approach is further optimized using reinforcement learning with two general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on CoSER benchmark, Cross-MR, and LifeChoice demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

Conclusion: CogDual successfully addresses the limitations of existing RPLAs by incorporating cognitive mechanisms, achieving superior performance in character consistency and contextual alignment while demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across various role-playing scenarios.

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) have emerged as a significant
application direction for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches
typically rely on prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning to enable models
to imitate character behaviors in specific scenarios, but often neglect the
underlying \emph{cognitive} mechanisms driving these behaviors. Inspired by
cognitive psychology, we introduce \textbf{CogDual}, a novel RPLA adopting a
\textit{cognize-then-respond } reasoning paradigm. By jointly modeling external
situational awareness and internal self-awareness, CogDual generates responses
with improved character consistency and contextual alignment. To further
optimize the performance, we employ reinforcement learning with two
general-purpose reward schemes designed for open-domain text generation.
Extensive experiments on the CoSER benchmark, as well as Cross-MR and
LifeChoice, demonstrate that CogDual consistently outperforms existing
baselines and generalizes effectively across diverse role-playing tasks.

### [11] [SKA-Bench: A Fine-Grained Benchmark for Evaluating Structured Knowledge Understanding of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17178)
*Zhiqiang Liu,Enpei Niu,Yin Hua,Mengshu Sun,Lei Liang,Huajun Chen,Wen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces SKA-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large language models' understanding of structured knowledge (KG, Table, KG+Text, Table+Text) across four fundamental abilities: noise robustness, order insensitivity, information integration, and negative rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations for structured knowledge understanding in LLMs are non-rigorous, lacking evaluations of specific capabilities and focusing only on single types of structured knowledge. There is a need for more comprehensive and rigorous benchmarks to diagnose LLMs' shortcomings in understanding structured knowledge.

Method: The authors develop SKA-Bench using a three-stage pipeline to construct instances containing questions, answers, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. They expand these instances into four fundamental ability testbeds covering different structured knowledge forms (KG, Table, KG+Text, Table+Text) and evaluate models on noise robustness, order insensitivity, information integration, and negative rejection capabilities.

Result: Empirical evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including advanced DeepSeek-R1, reveal that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding structured knowledge. Performance is influenced by factors such as noise amount, knowledge unit order, and hallucination phenomena.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have substantial limitations in structured knowledge understanding across multiple dimensions. The proposed SKA-Bench provides a more rigorous evaluation framework that can help identify specific weaknesses in LLMs' structured knowledge processing capabilities, revealing that even advanced models struggle with noise, order sensitivity, and hallucination issues.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
understanding Structured Knowledge (SK) like KG and Table, existing evaluations
for SK understanding are non-rigorous (i.e., lacking evaluations of specific
capabilities) and focus on a single type of SK. Therefore, we aim to propose a
more comprehensive and rigorous structured knowledge understanding benchmark to
diagnose the shortcomings of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce SKA-Bench, a
Structured Knowledge Augmented QA Benchmark that encompasses four widely used
structured knowledge forms: KG, Table, KG+Text, and Table+Text. We utilize a
three-stage pipeline to construct SKA-Bench instances, which includes a
question, an answer, positive knowledge units, and noisy knowledge units. To
evaluate the SK understanding capabilities of LLMs in a fine-grained manner, we
expand the instances into four fundamental ability testbeds: Noise Robustness,
Order Insensitivity, Information Integration, and Negative Rejection. Empirical
evaluations on 8 representative LLMs, including the advanced DeepSeek-R1,
indicate that existing LLMs still face significant challenges in understanding
structured knowledge, and their performance is influenced by factors such as
the amount of noise, the order of knowledge units, and hallucination
phenomenon. Our dataset and code are available at

Tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and strategic risk management. They evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot setting.

Result: ChatGPT was the best-performing agent with 48.9% overall accuracy, which while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis revealed five recurring failure patterns including Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial Terminological Bias, and Operational Process Awareness Barrier.

Conclusion: The study provides the first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain and identifies crucial research directions for improving AI agents in financial applications. The significant performance gap between AI agents and financial experts highlights the need for specialized development in this critical field.

Abstract: The booming development of AI agents presents unprecedented opportunities for
automating complex tasks across various domains. However, their multi-step,
multi-tool collaboration capabilities in the financial sector remain
underexplored. This paper introduces FinGAIA, an end-to-end benchmark designed
to evaluate the practical abilities of AI agents in the financial domain.
FinGAIA comprises 407 meticulously crafted tasks, spanning seven major
financial sub-domains: securities, funds, banking, insurance, futures, trusts,
and asset management. These tasks are organized into three hierarchical levels
of scenario depth: basic business analysis, asset decision support, and
strategic risk management. We evaluated 10 mainstream AI agents in a zero-shot
setting. The best-performing agent, ChatGPT, achieved an overall accuracy of
48.9\%, which, while superior to non-professionals, still lags financial
experts by over 35 percentage points. Error analysis has revealed five
recurring failure patterns: Cross-modal Alignment Deficiency, Financial
Terminological Bias, Operational Process Awareness Barrier, among others. These
patterns point to crucial directions for future research. Our work provides the
first agent benchmark closely related to the financial domain, aiming to
objectively assess and promote the development of agents in this crucial field.

### [13] [The Pluralistic Moral Gap: Understanding Judgment and Value Differences between Humans and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17216)
*Giuseppe Russo,Debora Nozza,Paul Röttger,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces a benchmark to evaluate how well Large Language Models align with human moral judgments, finding that LLMs struggle with controversial moral dilemmas and use a narrower range of moral values than humans, then proposes Dynamic Moral Profiling to improve alignment by 64.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As people increasingly rely on LLMs for moral advice that may influence human decisions, there is a critical need to understand how closely LLMs align with human moral judgments, particularly given the lack of existing knowledge in this area.

Method: The researchers created the Moral Dilemma Dataset with 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with human judgments, treated alignment as a pluralistic distributional task, built a 60-value taxonomy from 3,783 value expressions, and developed Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP) - a Dirichlet-based sampling method that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles.

Result: LLMs only reproduce human judgments under high consensus and alignment deteriorates when human disagreement increases. LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral values than humans, revealing a pluralistic moral gap. DMP improves alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity in model outputs.

Conclusion: There exists a significant pluralistic moral gap between LLMs and humans in both distribution and diversity of moral values expressed. The proposed Dynamic Moral Profiling method offers a promising step toward achieving more pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

Abstract: People increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for moral advice,
which may influence humans' decisions. Yet, little is known about how closely
LLMs align with human moral judgments. To address this, we introduce the Moral
Dilemma Dataset, a benchmark of 1,618 real-world moral dilemmas paired with a
distribution of human moral judgments consisting of a binary evaluation and a
free-text rationale. We treat this problem as a pluralistic distributional
alignment task, comparing the distributions of LLM and human judgments across
dilemmas. We find that models reproduce human judgments only under high
consensus; alignment deteriorates sharply when human disagreement increases. In
parallel, using a 60-value taxonomy built from 3,783 value expressions
extracted from rationales, we show that LLMs rely on a narrower set of moral
values than humans. These findings reveal a pluralistic moral gap: a mismatch
in both the distribution and diversity of values expressed. To close this gap,
we introduce Dynamic Moral Profiling (DMP), a Dirichlet-based sampling method
that conditions model outputs on human-derived value profiles. DMP improves
alignment by 64.3% and enhances value diversity, offering a step toward more
pluralistic and human-aligned moral guidance from LLMs.

### [14] [CLARIFID: Improving Radiology Report Generation by Reinforcing Clinically Accurate Impressions and Enforcing Detailed Findings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17234)
*Kyeongkyu Lee,Seonghwan Yoon,Hongki Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLARIFID is a novel framework for automatic radiology report generation that mimics expert workflow by first generating comprehensive findings and then creating impressions, using multi-view chest X-rays and reinforcement learning to optimize diagnostic correctness rather than just text fluency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic radiology report generation methods focus on producing fluent text but fail to ensure factual correctness and clinical reliability. Most approaches use single-view images and don't follow the logical clinical reasoning workflow that radiologists use, limiting their diagnostic comprehensiveness and clinical utility.

Method: CLARIFID employs a four-step approach: (1) section-aware pretraining to learn the logical flow from Findings to Impression, (2) fine-tuning with Proximal Policy Optimization using CheXbert F1 score as reward, (3) reasoning-aware decoding that generates Findings before Impression, and (4) multi-view fusion using vision-transformer-based encoder. During inference, it uses reasoning-aware next-token forcing and report-level re-ranking.

Result: Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset show that CLARIFID achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing baselines on both standard natural language generation metrics and clinically aware evaluation scores, demonstrating improved diagnostic correctness.

Conclusion: CLARIFID successfully addresses the key limitations of existing radiology report generation methods by directly optimizing for diagnostic correctness rather than text fluency, incorporating multi-view analysis, and following expert clinical reasoning workflow, resulting in more clinically reliable and comprehensive radiology reports.

Abstract: Automatic generation of radiology reports has the potential to alleviate
radiologists' significant workload, yet current methods struggle to deliver
clinically reliable conclusions. In particular, most prior approaches focus on
producing fluent text without effectively ensuring the factual correctness of
the reports and often rely on single-view images, limiting diagnostic
comprehensiveness. We propose CLARIFID, a novel framework that directly
optimizes diagnostic correctness by mirroring the two-step workflow of experts.
Specifically, CLARIFID (1) learns the logical flow from Findings to Impression
through section-aware pretraining, (2) is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy
Optimization in which the CheXbert F1 score of the Impression section serves as
the reward, (3) enforces reasoning-aware decoding that completes "Findings"
before synthesizing the "Impression", and (4) fuses multiple chest X-ray views
via a vision-transformer-based multi-view encoder. During inference, we apply a
reasoning-aware next-token forcing strategy followed by report-level
re-ranking, ensuring that the model first produces a comprehensive Findings
section before synthesizing the Impression and thereby preserving coherent
clinical reasoning. Experimental results on the MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves superior clinical efficacy and outperforms existing
baselines on both standard NLG metrics and clinically aware scores.

*Zhili Shen,Chenxin Diao,Pascual Merita,Pavlos Vougiouklis,Jeff Z. Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper adapts the state-of-the-art graph-based RAG solution GeAR to evaluate its performance and limitations on the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge, addressing the limited evidence of general applicability of graph-based RAG methods across broader datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent graph-based retrieval-augmented generation methods that leverage structured information like entities and relations have shown promise but are typically designed for specific tasks (multi-hop QA, query-focused summarization), with limited evidence of their general applicability across broader datasets.

Method: The authors adapt GeAR, a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG solution, and evaluate it on the SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge to test its broader applicability beyond task-specific scenarios.

Result: The paper explores the performance and identifies limitations of the adapted GeAR system when applied to the LiveRAG Challenge dataset, providing insights into the general applicability of graph-based RAG approaches.

Conclusion: The study contributes to understanding the broader applicability of graph-based RAG methods by testing a state-of-the-art solution on a more general dataset, revealing both performance characteristics and limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored graph-based approaches to retrieval-augmented
generation, leveraging structured or semi-structured information -- such as
entities and their relations extracted from documents -- to enhance retrieval.
However, these methods are typically designed to address specific tasks, such
as multi-hop question answering and query-focused summarisation, and therefore,
there is limited evidence of their general applicability across broader
datasets. In this paper, we aim to adapt a state-of-the-art graph-based RAG
solution: $\text{GeAR}$ and explore its performance and limitations on the
SIGIR 2025 LiveRAG Challenge.

### [17] [Investigating Subjective Factors of Argument Strength: Storytelling, Emotions, and Hedging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17409)
*Carlotta Quensel,Neele Falk,Gabriella Lapesa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates how subjective factors (emotions, storytelling, and hedging) affect argument strength by analyzing their impact on both objective argument quality and subjective persuasion through regression analysis on existing datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of large-scale analyses examining the relationship between subjective features and argument strength, despite the growing recognition of subjectivity as valuable in NLP and existing studies on individual subjective features like personal stories.

Method: The authors conduct regression analysis to quantify the impact of three subjective factors (emotions, storytelling, and hedging) on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality and subjective persuasion. They also compare and evaluate automated annotation methods for each subjective feature.

Result: The analysis reveals different patterns of impact for subjective features on argument strength: storytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective versus subjective argument quality, while emotions' influence depends on their rhetorical utilization rather than the domain context.

Conclusion: Subjective factors play distinct and complex roles in argument strength assessment, with storytelling and hedging showing opposing effects on objective and subjective quality measures, and emotional impact being determined by rhetorical usage patterns rather than topic domains.

Abstract: In assessing argument strength, the notions of what makes a good argument are
manifold. With the broader trend towards treating subjectivity as an asset and
not a problem in NLP, new dimensions of argument quality are studied. Although
studies on individual subjective features like personal stories exist, there is
a lack of large-scale analyses of the relation between these features and
argument strength. To address this gap, we conduct regression analysis to
quantify the impact of subjective factors $-$ emotions, storytelling, and
hedging $-$ on two standard datasets annotated for objective argument quality
and subjective persuasion. As such, our contribution is twofold: at the level
of contributed resources, as there are no datasets annotated with all studied
dimensions, this work compares and evaluates automated annotation methods for
each subjective feature. At the level of novel insights, our regression
analysis uncovers different patterns of impact of subjective features on the
two facets of argument strength encoded in the datasets. Our results show that
storytelling and hedging have contrasting effects on objective and subjective
argument quality, while the influence of emotions depends on their rhetoric
utilization rather than the domain.

### [18] [Each to Their Own: Exploring the Optimal Embedding in RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17442)
*Shiting Chen,Zijian Zhao,Jinsong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes two methods to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by combining multiple embedding models: Mixture-Embedding RAG and Confident RAG, with Confident RAG showing superior performance by selecting responses with highest confidence levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Different embedding models in RAG systems exhibit varying benefits across domains due to heterogeneous training data and architectures, leading to inconsistent similarity calculations and varying response quality from LLMs. The authors aim to address this limitation by leveraging multiple embedding models to improve RAG performance.

Method: Two approaches are proposed: (1) Mixture-Embedding RAG - sorts and selects retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity scores, and (2) Confident RAG - generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and selects the response with the highest confidence level.

Result: Mixture-Embedding RAG does not outperform vanilla RAG. However, Confident RAG demonstrates significant improvements with approximately 10% improvement over vanilla LLMs and 5% improvement over standard RAG. The results are consistent across different LLMs and embedding models.

Conclusion: Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach that can be applied across various domains to enhance RAG performance. The method successfully addresses the heterogeneity problem in embedding models by leveraging confidence-based selection, making it a practical solution for improving LLM response quality.

Abstract: Recently, as Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally impacted various
fields, the methods for incorporating up-to-date information into LLMs or
adding external knowledge to construct domain-specific models have garnered
wide attention. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), serving as an
inference-time scaling method, is notable for its low cost and minimal effort
for parameter tuning. However, due to heterogeneous training data and model
architecture, the variant embedding models used in RAG exhibit different
benefits across various areas, often leading to different similarity
calculation results and, consequently, varying response quality from LLMs. To
address this problem, we propose and examine two approaches to enhance RAG by
combining the benefits of multiple embedding models, named Mixture-Embedding
RAG and Confident RAG. Mixture-Embedding RAG simply sorts and selects
retrievals from multiple embedding models based on standardized similarity;
however, it does not outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, Confident RAG
generates responses multiple times using different embedding models and then
selects the responses with the highest confidence level, demonstrating average
improvements of approximately 10% and 5% over vanilla LLMs and RAG,
respectively. The consistent results across different LLMs and embedding models
indicate that Confident RAG is an efficient plug-and-play approach for various
domains. We will release our code upon publication.

### [19] [MultiNRC: A Challenging and Native Multilingual Reasoning Evaluation Benchmark for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17476)
*Alexander R. Fabbri,Diego Mares,Jorge Flores,Meher Mankikar,Ernesto Hernandez,Dean Lee,Bing Liu,Chen Xing*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces MultiNRC, a new benchmark with over 1,000 native reasoning questions in French, Spanish, and Chinese to evaluate LLMs' multilingual reasoning capabilities. Current leading LLMs perform poorly (under 50%) on native multilingual reasoning, with significant performance gaps between English and original languages, especially in culturally grounded tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are biased towards English contexts as they are typically translations of English benchmarks. There is a need to evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in truly native, culturally grounded contexts across diverse languages beyond simple translation-based assessments.

Method: The authors created MultiNRC with 1,000+ native reasoning questions written by native speakers in French, Spanish, and Chinese across four categories: language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition reasoning, and culturally relevant math reasoning. They also provided English translations for cultural and math questions to enable direct comparison. 14 leading LLMs were systematically evaluated on this benchmark.

Result: All 14 evaluated LLMs scored below 50% on MultiNRC, demonstrating poor native multilingual reasoning performance. Models showed varying strengths across linguistic, cultural, and logical reasoning tasks. Most models performed substantially better (+10%) on math reasoning in English compared to original languages, highlighting persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

Conclusion: Current LLMs struggle significantly with native multilingual reasoning tasks, particularly those requiring cultural knowledge. The substantial performance gap between English and original languages indicates that LLMs have not yet achieved true multilingual reasoning capability and remain biased towards English-centric knowledge and reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Although recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown rapid improvement on
reasoning benchmarks in English, the evaluation of such LLMs' multilingual
reasoning capability across diverse languages and cultural contexts remains
limited. Existing multilingual reasoning benchmarks are typically constructed
by translating existing English reasoning benchmarks, biasing these benchmarks
towards reasoning problems with context in English language/cultures. In this
work, we introduce the Multilingual Native Reasoning Challenge (MultiNRC), a
benchmark designed to assess LLMs on more than 1,000 native, linguistic and
culturally grounded reasoning questions written by native speakers in French,
Spanish, and Chinese. MultiNRC covers four core reasoning categories:
language-specific linguistic reasoning, wordplay & riddles, cultural/tradition
reasoning, and math reasoning with cultural relevance. For cultural/tradition
reasoning and math reasoning with cultural relevance, we also provide English
equivalent translations of the multilingual questions by manual translation
from native speakers fluent in English. This set of English equivalents can
provide a direct comparison of LLM reasoning capacity in other languages vs.
English on the same reasoning questions. We systematically evaluate current 14
leading LLMs covering most LLM families on MultiNRC and its English equivalent
set. The results show that (1) current LLMs are still not good at native
multilingual reasoning, with none scoring above 50% on MultiNRC; (2) LLMs
exhibit distinct strengths and weaknesses in handling linguistic, cultural, and
logical reasoning tasks; (3) Most models perform substantially better in math
reasoning in English compared to in original languages (+10%), indicating
persistent challenges with culturally grounded knowledge.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 is an end-to-end simultaneous interpretation system that achieves high-quality speech-to-speech translation with voice cloning in near real-time, reducing latency by 70% while maintaining over 70% translation accuracy in complex scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automatic simultaneous interpretation systems suffer from poor transcription/translation quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and speech inflation issues, especially in long-form content. There is a need for a product-level solution that can address these fundamental challenges.

Method: The paper introduces a novel duplex speech-to-speech understanding-generating framework that enables end-to-end simultaneous interpretation with voice cloning capabilities. The system utilizes large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning to optimize the balance between translation accuracy and latency.

Result: The model achieves over 70% correctness in complex scenarios as validated by human interpreters. It significantly outperforms commercial SI solutions in translation quality while reducing average latency of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to 3 seconds (approximately 70% reduction).

Conclusion: Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 successfully addresses the major challenges in simultaneous interpretation by delivering a product-level solution that combines high translation accuracy with ultra-low latency and voice cloning capabilities, making it practically viable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) represents one of the most daunting
frontiers in the translation industry, with product-level automatic systems
long plagued by intractable challenges: subpar transcription and translation
quality, lack of real-time speech generation, multi-speaker confusion, and
translated speech inflation, especially in long-form discourses. In this study,
we introduce Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0, an end-to-end SI model that delivers
high-fidelity, ultra-low-latency speech-to-speech generation with voice cloning
capabilities. As a fully operational product-level solution, Seed-LiveInterpret
2.0 tackles these challenges head-on through our novel duplex speech-to-speech
understanding-generating framework. Experimental results demonstrate that
through large-scale pretraining and reinforcement learning, the model achieves
a significantly better balance between translation accuracy and latency,
validated by human interpreters to exceed 70% correctness in complex scenarios.
Notably, Seed-LiveInterpret 2.0 outperforms commercial SI solutions by
significant margins in translation quality, while slashing the average latency
of cloned speech from nearly 10 seconds to a near-real-time 3 seconds, which is
around a near 70% reduction that drastically enhances practical usability.

### [21] [Synthetic Voice Data for Automatic Speech Recognition in African Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17578)
*Brian DeRenzi,Anna Dixon,Mohamed Aymane Farhi,Christian Resch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic assessment of using synthetic voice data for African language ASR, creating over 2,500 hours of synthetic speech data at 1% the cost of real data and demonstrating that combining real and synthetic data can match or exceed real-data-only baselines for low-resource African languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech technology is inaccessible for most of the 2300+ African languages due to lack of training data. The authors aim to address this gap by exploring synthetic voice corpora as a cost-effective solution for improving ASR performance in African languages, particularly for very low-resource scenarios.

Method: A three-step process: (1) LLM-driven text creation for generating readable content in target languages, (2) TTS voice synthesis to create synthetic audio data, and (3) ASR fine-tuning using Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models with combinations of real and synthetic data. The approach was evaluated on three African languages: Hausa, Dholuo, and Chichewa.

Result: Created over 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at below 1% cost of real data. For Hausa, 250h real + 250h synthetic matched 500h real-data baseline performance, with best results using 579h real + 450-993h synthetic data. Chichewa showed ~6.5% relative WER improvement with 1:2 real-to-synthetic ratio. Dholuo showed mixed results with 1:1 ratio. Eight out of ten languages achieved readability scores above 5/7.

Conclusion: Synthetic voice data can effectively augment real data for African language ASR, particularly when combined appropriately with real data. However, the effectiveness varies by language and data ratio. The study reveals challenges in evaluation protocols and dataset quality that need addressing. All data and models are publicly released to encourage further research in African language speech technology.

Abstract: Speech technology remains out of reach for most of the over 2300 languages in
Africa. We present the first systematic assessment of large-scale synthetic
voice corpora for African ASR. We apply a three-step process: LLM-driven text
creation, TTS voice synthesis, and ASR fine-tuning. Eight out of ten languages
for which we create synthetic text achieved readability scores above 5 out of
7. We evaluated ASR improvement for three (Hausa, Dholuo, Chichewa) and created
more than 2,500 hours of synthetic voice data at below 1% of the cost of real
data. Fine-tuned Wav2Vec-BERT-2.0 models trained on 250h real and 250h
synthetic Hausa matched a 500h real-data-only baseline, while 579h real and
450h to 993h synthetic data created the best performance. We also present
gender-disaggregated ASR performance evaluation. For very low-resource
languages, gains varied: Chichewa WER improved about 6.5% relative with a 1:2
real-to-synthetic ratio; a 1:1 ratio for Dholuo showed similar improvements on
some evaluation data, but not on others. Investigating intercoder reliability,
ASR errors and evaluation datasets revealed the need for more robust reviewer
protocols and more accurate evaluation data. All data and models are publicly
released to invite further work to improve synthetic data for African
languages.

### [22] [A Hybrid Early-Exit Algorithm for Large Language Models Based on Space Alignment Decoding (SPADE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17618)
*Bowen Zheng,Ming Ma,Zhongqiao Lin,Tianming Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes SPADE, a novel decoding method that enables early-exit from large language models by aligning intermediate layer representations with output layers, significantly reducing inference costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep structures, and existing early-exit algorithms suffer from poor performance due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations, leading to decoding inaccuracy.

Method: SPADE (SPace Alignment DEcoding) aligns intermediate layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced sequence of only the start token and answer token. The method is optimized with a linear approximation that computes entropy-based confidence metrics for early-exit decision-making, creating a hybrid early-exit algorithm.

Result: The approach significantly reduces inference costs without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for deploying large language models in real-world applications.

Conclusion: SPADE successfully addresses the misalignment problem in early-exit algorithms and provides an effective method to reduce computational costs of large language models while maintaining high-quality outputs through space alignment and confidence monitoring.

Abstract: Large language models are computationally expensive due to their deep
structures. Prior research has shown that intermediate layers contain
sufficient information to generate accurate answers, leading to the development
of early-exit algorithms that reduce inference costs by terminating computation
at earlier layers. However, these methods often suffer from poor performance
due to misalignment between intermediate and output layer representations that
lead to decoding inaccuracy. To address these challenges, we propose SPADE
(SPace Alignment DEcoding), a novel decoding method that aligns intermediate
layer representations with the output layer by propagating a minimally reduced
sequence consisting of only the start token and the answer token. We further
optimize the early-exit decision-making process by training a linear
approximation of SPADE that computes entropy-based confidence metrics. Putting
them together, we create a hybrid early-exit algorithm that monitors confidence
levels and stops inference at intermediate layers while using SPADE to generate
high-quality outputs. This approach significantly reduces inference costs
without compromising accuracy, offering a scalable and efficient solution for
deploying large language models in real-world applications.

### [23] [WSM: Decay-Free Learning Rate Schedule via Checkpoint Merging for LLM Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17634)
*Changxin Tian,Jiapeng Wang,Qian Zhao,Kunlong Chen,Jia Liu,Ziqi Liu,Jiaxin Mao,Wayne Xin Zhao,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WSM is a framework that replaces traditional learning rate decay with model merging techniques, achieving better performance than standard decay approaches across multiple benchmarks while providing theoretical foundations for emulating various decay strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional learning rate decay approaches have limitations, and recent decay-free methods using model merging show promise. There's a need for a unified theoretical framework that can formally connect learning rate decay with model merging while maintaining compatibility with diverse optimization methods.

Method: The paper presents Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes formal connections between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM emulates various decay strategies (cosine, linear, inverse square root) as principled model averaging schemes. The method focuses on merge duration as a critical factor and maintains compatibility with different optimization approaches.

Result: WSM consistently outperforms the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks with significant improvements: +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on MMLU-Pro. The framework also shows advantages in supervised fine-tuning scenarios. Merge duration was identified as the most critical factor, more important than checkpoint interval and merge quantity.

Conclusion: The WSM framework successfully bridges learning rate decay and model merging, providing both theoretical foundations and practical improvements. The approach demonstrates superior performance across various tasks and shows potential for long-term model refinement, establishing model merging as a viable alternative to traditional decay methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in learning rate (LR) scheduling have demonstrated the
effectiveness of decay-free approaches that eliminate the traditional decay
phase while maintaining competitive performance. Model merging techniques have
emerged as particularly promising solutions in this domain. We present
Warmup-Stable and Merge (WSM), a general framework that establishes a formal
connection between learning rate decay and model merging. WSM provides a
unified theoretical foundation for emulating various decay strategies-including
cosine decay, linear decay and inverse square root decay-as principled model
averaging schemes, while remaining fully compatible with diverse optimization
methods. Through extensive experiments, we identify merge duration-the training
window for checkpoint aggregation-as the most critical factor influencing model
performance, surpassing the importance of both checkpoint interval and merge
quantity. Our framework consistently outperforms the widely-adopted
Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) approach across multiple benchmarks, achieving
significant improvements of +3.5% on MATH, +2.9% on HumanEval, and +5.5% on
MMLU-Pro. The performance advantages extend to supervised fine-tuning
scenarios, highlighting WSM's potential for long-term model refinement.

### [24] [Who Attacks, and Why? Using LLMs to Identify Negative Campaigning in 18M Tweets across 19 Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17636)
*Victor Hartman,Petter Törnberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study introduces zero-shot Large Language Models for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning and conducts the largest cross-national analysis of 18 million tweets from European parliamentarians, revealing that governing parties use less negative messaging while extreme and populist parties (especially radical right) engage in more negativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research on negative campaigning has been limited by high costs and poor scalability of classification methods. There was a need for better cross-lingual approaches to enable large-scale comparative studies of political communication across different countries and languages.

Method: The study uses zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) for cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning content. They validate this approach using benchmark datasets in ten languages and then apply it to analyze 18 million tweets from parliamentarians across 19 European countries between 2017-2022.

Result: LLMs achieved performance comparable to native-speaking human coders and outperformed conventional supervised machine learning approaches. The analysis revealed that governing parties use less negative messaging, while ideologically extreme and populist parties (particularly radical right parties) engage in significantly higher levels of negative campaigning.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that LLMs can enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political communication across linguistic and cultural contexts. It advances understanding of how party-level characteristics influence strategic communication in multiparty systems, showing consistent cross-national patterns in negative campaigning behavior.

Abstract: Negative campaigning is a central feature of political competition, yet
empirical research has been limited by the high cost and limited scalability of
existing classification methods. This study makes two key contributions. First,
it introduces zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel approach for
cross-lingual classification of negative campaigning. Using benchmark datasets
in ten languages, we demonstrate that LLMs achieve performance on par with
native-speaking human coders and outperform conventional supervised machine
learning approaches. Second, we leverage this novel method to conduct the
largest cross-national study of negative campaigning to date, analyzing 18
million tweets posted by parliamentarians in 19 European countries between 2017
and 2022. The results reveal consistent cross-national patterns: governing
parties are less likely to use negative messaging, while ideologically extreme
and populist parties -- particularly those on the radical right -- engage in
significantly higher levels of negativity. These findings advance our
understanding of how party-level characteristics shape strategic communication
in multiparty systems. More broadly, the study demonstrates the potential of
LLMs to enable scalable, transparent, and replicable research in political
communication across linguistic and cultural contexts.

### [25] [Towards Greater Leverage: Scaling Laws for Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17702)
*Changxin Tian,Kunlong Chen,Jia Liu,Ziqi Liu,Zhiqiang Zhang,Jun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces Efficiency Leverage (EL) as a metric to predict the computational advantage of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models over dense models, derives scaling laws through training 300+ models, and validates findings with Ling-mini-beta that matches a 6.1B dense model's performance using 7x fewer resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The decoupling of total parameters from computational cost in MoE architectures creates a critical challenge: predicting model capacity for given MoE configurations (expert activation ratio, granularity) remains unresolved, limiting efficient scaling of Large Language Models.

Method: Conducted large-scale empirical study training over 300 models up to 28B parameters to investigate relationships between MoE configurations and Efficiency Leverage. Analyzed expert activation ratio, total compute budget, and expert granularity effects, then integrated findings into unified scaling laws.

Result: Found that EL follows predictable power laws driven by expert activation ratio and compute budget, with expert granularity as a non-linear modulator having optimal ranges. Ling-mini-beta (0.85B active parameters) matched 6.1B dense model performance while using 7x fewer computational resources on 1T token dataset.

Conclusion: The work establishes a principled, empirically-grounded foundation for scaling efficient MoE models by providing unified scaling laws that accurately predict computational advantages based on architectural configurations, enabling better design decisions for future MoE deployments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a dominant architecture for scaling Large
Language Models (LLMs) efficiently by decoupling total parameters from
computational cost. However, this decoupling creates a critical challenge:
predicting the model capacity of a given MoE configurations (e.g., expert
activation ratio and granularity) remains an unresolved problem. To address
this gap, we introduce Efficiency Leverage (EL), a metric quantifying the
computational advantage of an MoE model over a dense equivalent. We conduct a
large-scale empirical study, training over 300 models up to 28B parameters, to
systematically investigate the relationship between MoE architectural
configurations and EL. Our findings reveal that EL is primarily driven by the
expert activation ratio and the total compute budget, both following
predictable power laws, while expert granularity acts as a non-linear modulator
with a clear optimal range. We integrate these discoveries into a unified
scaling law that accurately predicts the EL of an MoE architecture based on its
configuration. To validate our derived scaling laws, we designed and trained
Ling-mini-beta, a pilot model for Ling-2.0 series with only 0.85B active
parameters, alongside a 6.1B dense model for comparison. When trained on an
identical 1T high-quality token dataset, Ling-mini-beta matched the performance
of the 6.1B dense model while consuming over 7x fewer computational resources,
thereby confirming the accuracy of our scaling laws. This work provides a
principled and empirically-grounded foundation for the scaling of efficient MoE
models.

*Parker Riley,Siamak Shakeri,Waleed Ammar,Jonathan H. Clark*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TyDi QA-WANA is a new question-answering dataset with 28K examples across 10 western Asian and northern African language varieties, designed to evaluate models on information-seeking questions with large text contexts, collected natively without translation to ensure cultural relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing question-answering datasets may lack cultural relevance and diversity in language varieties, particularly for western Asian and northern African languages. There's a need for datasets that can evaluate models' abilities to handle large text contexts while maintaining authentic, information-seeking questions that reflect genuine curiosity rather than artificially constructed queries.

Method: The researchers collected 28K question-answer examples across 10 language varieties of western Asia and northern Africa. The data collection process was specifically designed to elicit genuine information-seeking questions where askers are truly curious about the answers. Each question is paired with entire articles that may or may not contain the answer, creating relatively large text contexts. Importantly, data was collected directly in each target language without using translation to preserve cultural authenticity and relevance.

Result: The paper presents a comprehensive dataset called TyDi QA-WANA with 28K examples distributed among 10 language varieties. Two baseline models were evaluated on this dataset to establish initial performance benchmarks. The relatively large article sizes create a challenging task for evaluating models' capabilities in utilizing extensive text contexts for question answering.

Conclusion: TyDi QA-WANA provides a valuable resource for the research community by offering a culturally authentic, multilingual question-answering dataset that challenges models to work with large text contexts. The dataset fills a gap in language diversity and cultural relevance, with code and data being made publicly available to facilitate further research and model improvements in this domain.

Abstract: We present TyDi QA-WANA, a question-answering dataset consisting of 28K
examples divided among 10 language varieties of western Asia and northern
Africa. The data collection process was designed to elicit information-seeking
questions, where the asker is genuinely curious to know the answer. Each
question in paired with an entire article that may or may not contain the
answer; the relatively large size of the articles results in a task suitable
for evaluating models' abilities to utilize large text contexts in answering
questions. Furthermore, the data was collected directly in each language
variety, without the use of translation, in order to avoid issues of cultural
relevance. We present performance of two baseline models, and release our code
and data to facilitate further improvement by the research community.

*Karen Zhou,John Giorgi,Pranav Mani,Peng Xu,Davis Liang,Chenhao Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper develops a systematic pipeline to convert real physician feedback into structured checklists for evaluating AI-generated clinical notes, demonstrating superior performance over existing automated metrics in aligning with clinician preferences using data from over 21,000 clinical encounters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating AI-generated clinical notes is challenging due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review, while existing automated metrics fail to align with real-world physician preferences, creating a need for better evaluation methods.

Method: The authors propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured, interpretable checklists that are grounded in human feedback and can be enforced by LLM-based evaluators, using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters from a deployed AI medical scribe system.

Result: The feedback-derived checklist outperforms baseline approaches in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings, shows robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, demonstrates significant alignment with clinician preferences, and proves practical value as an evaluation methodology.

Conclusion: The proposed checklist-based evaluation methodology effectively bridges the gap between automated evaluation and human preferences for AI-generated clinical notes, providing a scalable and interpretable solution that can identify notes likely to fall below quality thresholds in offline research settings.

Abstract: AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but
evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and
limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to
align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a
pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured
checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be
interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based
evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters,
prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard, from a deployed AI
medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms
baseline approaches in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and
predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the
checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant
alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation
methodology. In offline research settings, the checklist can help identify
notes likely to fall below our chosen quality thresholds.

*Danny D. Leybzon,Shreyas Tirumala,Nishant Jain,Summer Gillen,Michael Jackson,Cameron McPhee,Jennifer Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Researchers developed an AI telephone survey system using LLMs, ASR, and speech synthesis to conduct quantitative surveys with human-like interactivity while maintaining methodological rigor, showing promising results in pilot studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional automated phone surveys using IVR technology lack natural interactivity and struggle with human speech idiosyncrasies. With the rise of voice-enabled AI, there's an opportunity to create more natural and adaptive survey experiences while scaling quantitative research and maintaining methodological standards.

Method: Built an AI survey system combining large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech synthesis technologies. The system was designed specifically for quantitative research, incorporating best practices like question order randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording. Conducted two pilot surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and follow-up human-administered surveys to assess respondent experiences.

Result: The AI survey system successfully conducted pilot surveys while measuring three key metrics: survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent satisfaction scores. Results indicated that shorter survey instruments and more responsive AI interviewers may lead to improvements across all measured metrics.

Conclusion: AI telephone surveying presents a viable alternative to traditional automated survey methods, offering more natural respondent interactions while maintaining research rigor. The system shows potential for scaling quantitative studies, with performance improvements linked to survey length optimization and AI responsiveness enhancements.

Abstract: With the rise of voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) systems,
quantitative survey researchers have access to a new data-collection mode: AI
telephone surveying. By using AI to conduct phone interviews, researchers can
scale quantitative studies while balancing the dual goals of human-like
interactivity and methodological rigor. Unlike earlier efforts that used
interactive voice response (IVR) technology to automate these surveys, voice AI
enables a more natural and adaptive respondent experience as it is more robust
to interruptions, corrections, and other idiosyncrasies of human speech.
  We built and tested an AI system to conduct quantitative surveys based on
large language models (LLM), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech
synthesis technologies. The system was specifically designed for quantitative
research, and strictly adhered to research best practices like question order
randomization, answer order randomization, and exact wording.
  To validate the system's effectiveness, we deployed it to conduct two pilot
surveys with the SSRS Opinion Panel and followed-up with a separate
human-administered survey to assess respondent experiences. We measured three
key metrics: the survey completion rates, break-off rates, and respondent
satisfaction scores. Our results suggest that shorter instruments and more
responsive AI interviewers may contribute to improvements across all three
metrics studied.

Motivation: The need for high-performance language models that can be efficiently deployed on resource-constrained devices, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and deployability for real-world applications.

Method: Novel cross-layer expert sharing mechanism that reuses expert modules across adjacent transformer layers, combined with pre-gated routing for memory-efficient expert loading. The model uses 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters, trained on 5-trillion tokens with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.

Result: Megrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to larger models across language understanding, instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation tasks, despite having significantly fewer activated parameters.

Conclusion: The Megrez2 architecture successfully achieves an optimal balance between accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it a strong candidate for real-world applications in resource-constrained environments while maintaining competitive performance with larger models.

Abstract: We present Megrez2, a novel lightweight and high-performance language model
architecture optimized for device native deployment. Megrez2 introduces a novel
cross-layer expert sharing mechanism, which significantly reduces total
parameter count by reusing expert modules across adjacent transformer layers
while maintaining most of the model's capacity. It also incorporates pre-gated
routing, enabling memory-efficient expert loading and faster inference. As the
first instantiation of the Megrez2 architecture, we introduce the
Megrez2-Preview model, which is pre-trained on a 5-trillion-token corpus and
further enhanced through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards. With only 3B activated and 7.5B stored parameters,
Megrez2-Preview demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to
larger models on a wide range of tasks, including language understanding,
instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. These
results highlight the effectiveness of the Megrez2 architecture to achieve a
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and deployability, making it a strong
candidate for real-world, resource-constrained applications.

### [30] [Pretraining on the Test Set Is No Longer All You Need: A Debate-Driven Approach to QA Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17747)
*Linbo Cao,Jinman Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that converts existing QA datasets into adversarial debates between models to better assess reasoning abilities while reducing data contamination and memorization issues in language model evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard QA benchmarks are becoming saturated by frontier language models, with persistent concerns about data contamination, memorization, and high costs of creating new datasets. There's a need for evaluation methods that can assess genuine reasoning ability rather than memorized knowledge.

Method: The authors develop an evaluation pipeline that transforms QA datasets into structured adversarial debates where one model defends the official answer while another constructs and defends an alternative answer, with a blind judge model determining the winner. This forces multi-round argumentation and penalizes shallow memorization while reusing existing QA items.

Result: Empirical validation shows the method's robustness against data contamination - a Llama 3.1 model fine-tuned on test questions improved from 50% to 82% accuracy on standard QA but performed worse in debates. Even weaker judges can reliably differentiate stronger debaters, demonstrating scalability to future capable systems.

Conclusion: The debate-based evaluation framework offers a sustainable and cost-effective path for measuring genuine reasoning ability in advanced language models, showing that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need" and providing better resistance to data contamination compared to traditional QA benchmarks.

Abstract: As frontier language models increasingly saturate standard QA benchmarks,
concerns about data contamination, memorization, and escalating dataset
creation costs persist. We propose a debate-driven evaluation paradigm that
transforms any existing QA dataset into structured adversarial debates--where
one model is given the official answer to defend, and another constructs and
defends an alternative answer--adjudicated by a judge model blind to the
correct solution. By forcing multi-round argumentation, this approach
substantially increases difficulty while penalizing shallow memorization, yet
reuses QA items to reduce curation overhead. We make two main contributions:
(1) an evaluation pipeline to systematically convert QA tasks into debate-based
assessments, and (2) a public benchmark that demonstrates our paradigm's
effectiveness on a subset of MMLU-Pro questions, complete with standardized
protocols and reference models. Empirical results validate the robustness of
the method and its effectiveness against data contamination--a Llama 3.1 model
fine-tuned on test questions showed dramatic accuracy improvements (50% -> 82%)
but performed worse in debates. Results also show that even weaker judges can
reliably differentiate stronger debaters, highlighting how debate-based
evaluation can scale to future, more capable systems while maintaining a
fraction of the cost of creating new benchmarks. Overall, our framework
underscores that "pretraining on the test set is no longer all you need,"
offering a sustainable path for measuring the genuine reasoning ability of
advanced language models.

*Yi-Shan Chu,Hsuan-Cheng Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Vision Transformer-based framework for disaster-affected area segmentation from satellite imagery that uses weakly supervised learning with PCA-based label expansion to improve disaster mapping when ground truth is limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance disaster-affected area segmentation for the Taiwan Space Agency's Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) when accurate ground truth annotations are unavailable, addressing the challenge of limited supervision in disaster mapping applications.

Method: Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture with multi-band satellite inputs (Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5), using PCA-based feature analysis and confidence index to expand manually annotated labels into weakly supervised training sets, with multiple decoder variants and multi-stage loss strategies.

Result: Demonstrated improved smoothness and reliability of segmentation results in case studies of 2022 Poyang Lake drought and 2023 Rhodes wildfire, with better spatial coherence and segmentation consistency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed ViT-based framework offers a scalable approach for disaster mapping that effectively handles limited supervision scenarios, providing enhanced segmentation quality for emergency response applications through weakly supervised learning techniques.

Abstract: We propose a vision transformer (ViT)-based deep learning framework to refine
disaster-affected area segmentation from remote sensing imagery, aiming to
support and enhance the Emergent Value Added Product (EVAP) developed by the
Taiwan Space Agency (TASA). The process starts with a small set of manually
annotated regions. We then apply principal component analysis (PCA)-based
feature space analysis and construct a confidence index (CI) to expand these
labels, producing a weakly supervised training set. These expanded labels are
then used to train ViT-based encoder-decoder models with multi-band inputs from
Sentinel-2 and Formosat-5 imagery. Our architecture supports multiple decoder
variants and multi-stage loss strategies to improve performance under limited
supervision. During the evaluation, model predictions are compared with
higher-resolution EVAP output to assess spatial coherence and segmentation
consistency. Case studies on the 2022 Poyang Lake drought and the 2023 Rhodes
wildfire demonstrate that our framework improves the smoothness and reliability
of segmentation results, offering a scalable approach for disaster mapping when
accurate ground truth is unavailable.

*Mohamed Adjel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for real-time monocular 3D human pose estimation that combines 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware lifting using camera intrinsics and anatomical priors, enabling accurate pose estimation without specialized hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D human pose estimation is challenging and ill-posed, especially in real-time unconstrained environments. Direct image-to-3D approaches require large datasets and heavy models, while existing methods lack the flexibility and efficiency needed for edge device deployment.

Method: The framework combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting that explicitly leverages camera intrinsics and subject-specific anatomical priors. It uses self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to generate large-scale plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic datasets.

Result: The approach enables fast, personalized, and accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized hardware, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices in unconstrained environments.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that bridging data-driven learning with model-based priors can improve accuracy, interpretability, and deployability of 3D human motion capture systems, offering a lightweight alternative to direct image-to-3D approaches for real-world applications.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging and ill-posed
problem, particularly in real-time settings and unconstrained environments.
While direct imageto-3D approaches require large annotated datasets and heavy
models, 2D-to-3D lifting offers a more lightweight and flexible
alternative-especially when enhanced with prior knowledge. In this work, we
propose a framework that combines real-time 2D keypoint detection with
geometry-aware 2D-to-3D lifting, explicitly leveraging known camera intrinsics
and subject-specific anatomical priors. Our approach builds on recent advances
in self-calibration and biomechanically-constrained inverse kinematics to
generate large-scale, plausible 2D-3D training pairs from MoCap and synthetic
datasets. We discuss how these ingredients can enable fast, personalized, and
accurate 3D pose estimation from monocular images without requiring specialized
hardware. This proposal aims to foster discussion on bridging data-driven
learning and model-based priors to improve accuracy, interpretability, and
deployability of 3D human motion capture on edge devices in the wild.

*Zelong Liu,Yuliang Gu,Zhichao Sun,Huachao Zhu,Xin Xiao,Bo Du,Laurent Najman,Yongchao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackCue is a novel coarse-to-fine method that generates robust crack cues by leveraging thin structure properties to improve crack detection generalization across different domains, achieving this through max-pooling/upsampling operations and reconstruction networks to create crack-free backgrounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning-based crack detection methods show good performance on training datasets but struggle to generalize to unseen domains. Previous methods overlook the thin structure property of cracks, which is crucial for robust detection across varied conditions like complex backgrounds, shadows, and different lighting.

Method: The method employs a coarse-to-fine approach: (1) applies max-pooling and upsampling operations on crack images to generate coarse crack-free backgrounds, (2) uses a reconstruction network to obtain fine crack-free backgrounds, (3) computes the difference between original images and fine crack-free backgrounds to generate robust crack cues that embed prior crack information, (4) integrates this as a plug-and-play component into existing crack detection networks.

Result: Extensive experimental results show that CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of three advanced baseline crack detection networks when incorporated as a plug-and-play method.

Conclusion: CrackCue successfully addresses the domain generalization problem in crack detection by leveraging thin structure properties through coarse-to-fine crack cue generation, providing robust crack prior information that is unaffected by environmental variations and can be easily integrated into existing detection frameworks.

Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive
in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in
generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is
usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a
novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue
generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to
generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we
first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image.
This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine
crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The
difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a
fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is
unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a
plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced
crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and
robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

*Xiaoqiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes CLAMP, a contrastive learning framework for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis that uses progressive attention fusion, multi-task contrastive learning, and adaptive multi-loss aggregation to better align text and image features for identifying aspect terms and their sentiment polarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MABSA methods suffer from cross-modal alignment noise and insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. Global modality alignment methods overlook the connection between aspect terms and their corresponding local visual regions, creating a representation gap between text and images that needs to be addressed.

Method: The paper introduces CLAMP, an end-to-end framework with three key modules: (1) Progressive Attention Fusion network for hierarchical, multi-stage cross-modal interactions to enhance fine-grained alignment and suppress irrelevant visual noise, (2) Multi-task Contrastive Learning combining global modal contrast and local granularity alignment, and (3) Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation using dynamic uncertainty-based weighting to calibrate loss contributions and mitigate gradient interference.

Result: CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority of existing state-of-the-art methods on standard public benchmarks for multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed CLAMP framework effectively addresses the limitations of existing MABSA methods by improving cross-modal alignment through progressive attention fusion, enhancing representation consistency via multi-task contrastive learning, and optimizing training through adaptive loss aggregation, resulting in superior performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal aspect-based sentiment analysis(MABSA) seeks to identify aspect
terms within paired image-text data and determine their fine grained sentiment
polarities, representing a fundamental task for improving the effectiveness of
applications such as product review systems and public opinion monitoring.
Existing methods face challenges such as cross modal alignment noise and
insufficient consistency in fine-grained representations. While global modality
alignment methods often overlook the connection between aspect terms and their
corresponding local visual regions, bridging the representation gap between
text and images remains a challenge. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces an end to end Contrastive Learning framework with Adaptive
Multi-loss and Progressive Attention Fusion(CLAMP). The framework is composed
of three novel modules: Progressive Attention Fusion network, Multi-task
Contrastive Learning, and Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation. The Progressive
Attention Fusion network enhances fine-grained alignment between textual
features and image regions via hierarchical, multi-stage cross modal
interactions, effectively suppressing irrelevant visual noise. Secondly,
multi-task contrastive learning combines global modal contrast and local
granularity alignment to enhance cross modal representation consistency.
Adaptive Multi-loss Aggregation employs a dynamic uncertainty based weighting
mechanism to calibrate loss contributions according to each task's uncertainty,
thereby mitigating gradient interference. Evaluation on standard public
benchmarks demonstrates that CLAMP consistently outperforms the vast majority
of existing state of the art methods.

### [35] [SIA: Enhancing Safety via Intent Awareness for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16856)
*Youngjin Na,Sangheon Jeong,Youngwan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free framework that improves safety in vision-language models by detecting harmful intent through a three-stage reasoning process involving visual abstraction, intent inference, and response refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face new safety risks when seemingly innocuous images and text combine to reveal harmful intent, and existing approaches like post hoc filtering or static refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks that emerge from multimodal input combinations.

Method: SIA uses a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning to understand images, (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting to detect harmful intent, and (3) intent-conditioned response refinement to mitigate risks. The framework dynamically adapts to implicit intent rather than relying on predefined rules.

Result: SIA achieves substantial safety improvements and outperforms prior methods on safety-critical benchmarks including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe. There is a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, but the safety gains demonstrate the value of the approach.

Conclusion: SIA effectively addresses multimodal safety risks through intent-aware reasoning, showing that proactive detection and mitigation of harmful intent can significantly improve VLM safety while maintaining reasonable performance, highlighting the importance of aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, new safety risks arise from the subtle interplay between images
and text. In particular, seemingly innocuous inputs can combine to reveal
harmful intent, leading to unsafe model responses. Despite increasing attention
to multimodal safety, previous approaches based on post hoc filtering or static
refusal prompts struggle to detect such latent risks, especially when
harmfulness emerges only from the combination of inputs. We propose SIA (Safety
via Intent Awareness), a training-free prompt engineering framework that
proactively detects and mitigates harmful intent in multimodal inputs. SIA
employs a three-stage reasoning process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning,
(2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, and (3)
intent-conditioned response refinement. Rather than relying on predefined rules
or classifiers, SIA dynamically adapts to the implicit intent inferred from the
image-text pair. Through extensive experiments on safety-critical benchmarks
including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, we demonstrate that SIA achieves
substantial safety improvements, outperforming prior methods. Although SIA
shows a minor reduction in general reasoning accuracy on MMStar, the
corresponding safety gains highlight the value of intent-aware reasoning in
aligning VLMs with human-centric values.

### [36] [Look Before You Fuse: 2D-Guided Cross-Modal Alignment for Robust 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16861)
*Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a method to improve 3D perception in autonomous vehicles by addressing misalignment issues between LiDAR and camera features in Bird's-Eye-View representation through three key components: Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF), and Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-camera fusion methods suffer from misalignment between modalities caused by projection errors from extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and LiDAR rolling shutter effects. These misalignments are concentrated at object-background boundaries and can be addressed using 2D object detection priors to pre-align cross-modal features before fusion.

Method: The approach consists of three main components: (1) Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC) that uses 2D object priors to correct local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs, (2) Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF) that processes calibrated results to suppress noise and enhance object-background boundaries, and (3) Structural Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM) that uses gated attention to efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes validation dataset with 71.5% mAP and 73.6% NDS, demonstrating improved 3D perception capabilities through better cross-modal feature alignment.

Conclusion: By identifying that projection errors concentrate at object-background boundaries and leveraging 2D object priors for pre-alignment, the proposed three-component approach successfully addresses both local and global misalignment issues in LiDAR-camera fusion, leading to enhanced 3D perception performance in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera inputs into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)
representation is crucial for enhancing 3D perception capabilities of
autonomous vehicles. However, current methods are often affected by
misalignment between camera and LiDAR features. This misalignment leads to
inaccurate depth supervision in camera branch and erroneous fusion during
cross-modal feature aggregation. The root cause of this misalignment lies in
projection errors, stemming from minor extrinsic calibration inaccuracies and
rolling shutter effect of LiDAR during vehicle motion. In this work, our key
insight is that these projection errors are predominantly concentrated at
object-background boundaries, which are readily identified by 2D detectors.
Based on this, our main motivation is to utilize 2D object priors to pre-align
cross-modal features before fusion. To address local misalignment, we propose
Prior Guided Depth Calibration (PGDC), which leverages 2D priors to correct
local misalignment and preserve correct cross-modal feature pairs. To resolve
global misalignment, we introduce Discontinuity Aware Geometric Fusion (DAGF)
to process calibrated results from PGDC, suppressing noise and explicitly
enhancing sharp transitions at object-background boundaries. To effectively
utilize these transition-aware depth representations, we incorporate Structural
Guidance Depth Modulator (SGDM), using a gated attention mechanism to
efficiently fuse aligned depth and image features. Our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes validation dataset, with its mAP and
NDS reaching 71.5% and 73.6% respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces the Turing Eye Test (TET), a perception-focused benchmark that reveals catastrophic failures in state-of-the-art MLLMs on visual tasks that humans find trivial, highlighting a key gap between current AI and human perception.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While recent research has focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in MLLMs, a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can Multimodal Large Language Models truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning to perception to address this critical gap.

Method: The authors introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on synthetic images that humans process intuitively. They test various approaches including in-context learning, training on language backbone, and fine-tuning the vision tower.

Result: State-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on perceptual tasks that are trivial for humans. In-context learning and training on language backbone fail to improve performance, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, indicating the challenges lie in vision tower generalization rather than language reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: The study reveals a key gap between current MLLMs and human perception, specifically in the vision tower's generalization abilities rather than in knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone. This highlights the need for improving visual perception in MLLMs to achieve human-like multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Achieving human-like perception and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) remains a central challenge in artificial intelligence. While
recent research has primarily focused on enhancing reasoning capabilities in
MLLMs, a fundamental question persists: Can Multimodal Large Language Models
truly perceive the world as humans do? This paper shifts focus from reasoning
to perception. Rather than constructing benchmarks specifically for reasoning,
we introduce the Turing Eye Test (TET), a challenging perception-oriented
benchmark comprising four diagnostic tasks that evaluate MLLMs' performance on
synthetic images that humans process intuitively. Our findings reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit catastrophic failures on our perceptual tasks
trivial for humans. Both in-context learning and training on language
backbone-effective for previous benchmarks-fail to improve performance on our
tasks, while fine-tuning the vision tower enables rapid adaptation, suggesting
that our benchmark poses challenges for vision tower generalization rather than
for the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the language backbone-a key gap
between current MLLMs and human perception. We release a representative subset
of TET tasks in this version, and will introduce more diverse tasks and methods
to enhance visual generalization in future work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIPPO-Video, a novel dataset for personalized video highlighting that uses LLM-based user simulators to generate realistic watch histories, and proposes HiPHer method that outperforms existing approaches by leveraging personalized user preferences for video segment saliency prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video datasets lack personalization and rely on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the complexity of user behavior and preferences. With the exponential growth of video content, there's a critical need for personalized video highlighting systems that can adapt to highly variable and complex user preferences.

Method: The authors create HIPPO-Video dataset using an LLM-based user simulator to generate realistic watch histories that reflect diverse user preferences. They then propose HiPHer, a method that leverages these personalized watch histories to predict preference-conditioned segment-wise saliency scores for video highlighting.

Result: The dataset contains 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs covering 20,400 videos across 170 semantic categories. Through extensive experiments, the proposed HiPHer method outperforms existing generic and query-based approaches for video highlighting tasks.

Conclusion: The work successfully demonstrates the potential of using personalized watch histories for highly user-centric video highlighting in real-world scenarios, with the proposed method showing superior performance compared to existing approaches that don't consider user personalization.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video content has made personalized video
highlighting an essential task, as user preferences are highly variable and
complex. Existing video datasets, however, often lack personalization, relying
on isolated videos or simple text queries that fail to capture the intricacies

personalized video highlighting, created using an LLM-based user simulator to
generate realistic watch histories reflecting diverse user preferences. The
dataset includes 2,040 (watch history, saliency score) pairs, covering 20,400

*Yizhi Hu,Zezhao Tian,Xingqun Qi,Chen Su,Bingkun Yang,Junhui Yin,Muyi Sun,Man Zhang,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces ReMeREC, a framework for multi-entity referring expression comprehension that models inter-entity relationships, along with a new dataset ReMeX containing detailed relationship annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing referring expression comprehension methods focus on single-entity localization and ignore complex inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, which limits their accuracy and reliability. Additionally, there's a lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained, paired image-text-relation annotations.

Method: The authors propose ReMeREC framework with two key components: (1) Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron (TMP) that dynamically infers entity quantity and span from textual cues, and (2) Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) for enhanced relational reasoning. They also construct ReMeX dataset with detailed relationship annotations and EntityText auxiliary dataset using large language models.

Result: ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming existing approaches in multi-entity grounding and relation prediction tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed ReMeREC framework successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by effectively modeling inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, demonstrating substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches through comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) aims to localize specified entities
or regions in an image based on natural language descriptions. While existing
methods handle single-entity localization, they often ignore complex
inter-entity relationships in multi-entity scenes, limiting their accuracy and
reliability. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets with fine-grained,
paired image-text-relation annotations hinders further progress. To address
this challenge, we first construct a relation-aware, multi-entity REC dataset
called ReMeX, which includes detailed relationship and textual annotations. We
then propose ReMeREC, a novel framework that jointly leverages visual and
textual cues to localize multiple entities while modeling their
inter-relations. To address the semantic ambiguity caused by implicit entity
boundaries in language, we introduce the Text-adaptive Multi-entity Perceptron
(TMP), which dynamically infers both the quantity and span of entities from
fine-grained textual cues, producing distinctive representations. Additionally,
our Entity Inter-relationship Reasoner (EIR) enhances relational reasoning and
global scene understanding. To further improve language comprehension for
fine-grained prompts, we also construct a small-scale auxiliary dataset,
EntityText, generated using large language models. Experiments on four
benchmark datasets show that ReMeREC achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-entity grounding and relation prediction, outperforming existing
approaches by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalStep is a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate stepwise causal reasoning in videos, featuring 100 videos with 1,852 QA pairs that require sequential understanding rather than exploiting global context shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video benchmarks fail to rigorously evaluate true causal and stepwise reasoning, mainly assessing shallow understanding and allowing models to exploit global context as shortcuts, which doesn't reflect robust video reasoning capabilities.

Method: The benchmark segments videos into causally linked units with strict stepwise QA protocol requiring sequential answers. It includes carefully constructed distractors based on error type taxonomy, spans 100 videos across six categories with 1,852 multiple-choice QA pairs, and introduces seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation.

Result: Experiments with leading proprietary and open-source models, as well as human baselines, reveal a significant gap between current models and human-level stepwise reasoning performance on the CausalStep benchmark.

Conclusion: CausalStep provides a rigorous benchmark that can drive progress in developing more robust and interpretable video reasoning capabilities by enforcing true stepwise causal understanding rather than allowing shortcut solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved reasoning in
text and image domains, yet achieving robust video reasoning remains a
significant challenge. Existing video benchmarks mainly assess shallow

CausalStep, a benchmark designed for explicit stepwise causal reasoning in
videos. CausalStep segments videos into causally linked units and enforces a
strict stepwise question-answer (QA) protocol, requiring sequential answers and
preventing shortcut solutions. Each question includes carefully constructed
distractors based on error type taxonomy to ensure diagnostic value. The
benchmark features 100 videos across six categories and 1,852 multiple-choice
QA pairs. We introduce seven diagnostic metrics for comprehensive evaluation,
enabling precise diagnosis of causal reasoning capabilities. Experiments with

*Antoni Kowalczuk,Dominik Hintersdorf,Lukas Struppek,Kristian Kersting,Adam Dziedzic,Franziska Boenisch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper exposes the fragility of current pruning-based defenses against memorization in text-to-image diffusion models and proposes a novel adversarial fine-tuning method to better remove memorized content rather than just suppressing it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models can memorize and replicate training data, raising data privacy and intellectual property concerns. Existing mitigation methods using pruning are assumed to localize memorization, but their robustness needs assessment.

Method: The authors evaluate pruning-based defenses by testing minor text embedding adjustments to re-trigger replication. They challenge memorization locality assumptions by analyzing diverse trigger locations in embedding space. They propose an adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication triggers and updates the model for increased robustness.

Result: Minor adjustments to text embeddings can re-trigger data replication even after pruning, demonstrating defense fragility. Memorization can be triggered from diverse locations in text embedding space through different model paths, challenging locality assumptions. The proposed adversarial fine-tuning method shows promise for building more robust defenses.

Conclusion: Existing pruning-based mitigation strategies are insufficient for preventing memorization in text-to-image diffusion models. True removal of memorized content is needed rather than suppression. The proposed adversarial fine-tuning approach provides a foundation for developing more trustworthy and compliant generative AI systems.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in
image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual
property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate
training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and
pruning weights responsible for triggering replication, based on the assumption
that memorization can be localized. Our research assesses the robustness of
these pruning-based approaches. We demonstrate that even after pruning, minor
adjustments to text embeddings of input prompts are sufficient to re-trigger
data replication, highlighting the fragility of these defenses. Furthermore, we
challenge the fundamental assumption of memorization locality, by showing that
replication can be triggered from diverse locations within the text embedding
space, and follows different paths in the model. Our findings indicate that
existing mitigation strategies are insufficient and underscore the need for
methods that truly remove memorized content, rather than attempting to suppress
its retrieval. As a first step in this direction, we introduce a novel
adversarial fine-tuning method that iteratively searches for replication
triggers and updates the model to increase robustness. Through our research, we
provide fresh insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and
a foundation for building more trustworthy and compliant generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics data is expensive and scarce, creating barriers for widespread adoption in biomedical research despite its revolutionary potential for tissue-level gene expression profiling.

Method: The framework combines three key innovations: (1) sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning to exploit intrinsic spatial patterns, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images for enhanced feature representation, and (3) Cascaded Data Consistent Imputation Network (CDCIN) for iterative prediction refinement while preserving data fidelity.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse tissue types (breast cancer, liver, lymphoid tissue) show that S2S-ST outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in imputation accuracy while requiring only sparse input data.

Conclusion: S2S-ST enables robust spatial transcriptomics reconstruction from sparse inputs, significantly reducing reliance on costly high-resolution data and facilitating broader adoption in biomedical research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionized biomedical research by
enabling high resolution gene expression profiling within tissues. However, the
high cost and scarcity of high resolution ST data remain significant
challenges. We present Single-shot Sparser-to-Sparse (S2S-ST), a novel

sparser-to-sparse self-supervised learning strategy that leverages intrinsic
spatial patterns in ST data, (2) cross-domain co-learning with natural images
to enhance feature representation, and (3) a Cascaded Data Consistent
Imputation Network (CDCIN) that iteratively refines predictions while

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While LLM-based agentic systems have shown promise across many domains, their application to medical imaging remains in its infancy. There is a need for more transparent, adaptable, and clinically aligned AI systems that can move beyond static prediction systems to enable dynamic interactions and contextual explanations in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: AURA represents a significant advancement toward more transparent, adaptable, and clinically aligned AI systems, highlighting the promise of agentic AI in transforming medical image analysis from static predictions to interactive decision support systems.

*Chiao-An Yang,Kuan-Chuan Peng,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Long-Tailed Online Anomaly Detection (LTOAD), a realistic setting that combines long-tailed data distribution with online learning for anomaly detection, proposing a class-agnostic framework that outperforms existing methods without requiring class labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection methods focus on either long-tailed distributions or online learning separately, but real-world scenarios require handling both challenges simultaneously. Current long-tailed anomaly detection (LTAD) methods are class-aware and cannot be directly applied to online settings where class labels are unavailable.

Method: The authors propose a class-agnostic framework for long-tailed anomaly detection that can be adapted to online learning settings. This framework eliminates the need for class labels while maintaining effectiveness in handling long-tailed data distributions during continuous learning.

Result: The method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines in most offline LTAD settings across industrial manufacturing and medical domains, with +4.63% image-AUROC improvement on MVTec dataset. In the challenging long-tailed online setting, it achieves +0.53% image-AUROC improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed class-agnostic framework successfully addresses the novel LTOAD task by combining long-tailed distribution handling with online learning capabilities, demonstrating effectiveness across multiple domains and releasing a benchmark for future research in this realistic anomaly detection setting.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) identifies the defect regions of a given image. Recent
works have studied AD, focusing on learning AD without abnormal images, with
long-tailed distributed training data, and using a unified model for all
classes. In addition, online AD learning has also been explored. In this work,
we expand in both directions to a realistic setting by considering the novel
task of long-tailed online AD (LTOAD). We first identified that the offline
state-of-the-art LTAD methods cannot be directly applied to the online setting.
Specifically, LTAD is class-aware, requiring class labels that are not
available in the online setting. To address this challenge, we propose a
class-agnostic framework for LTAD and then adapt it to our online learning
setting. Our method outperforms the SOTA baselines in most offline LTAD
settings, including both the industrial manufacturing and the medical domain.
In particular, we observe +4.63% image-AUROC on MVTec even compared to methods
that have access to class labels and the number of classes. In the most
challenging long-tailed online setting, we achieve +0.53% image-AUROC compared
to baselines. Our LTOAD benchmark is released here:

*Jacob Piland,Chris Sweet,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes new saliency-guided training methods that incorporate both true-class and false-class Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to improve deep learning model generalization, showing superior performance over traditional approaches that only use true-class CAMs across multiple binary classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing saliency-guided training methods only consider the model's class activation map for the correct-label class while ignoring the false-class CAMs. The authors hypothesize that in binary tasks, true and false CAMs should diverge on important classification features identified by humans, which could be leveraged to improve model training.

Method: The paper introduces three new saliency-guided training methods that incorporate both true-class and false-class CAMs into the training strategy, along with a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. These methods leverage the divergence between true and false CAMs on human-identified important features.

Result: The proposed methods demonstrate improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional saliency-guided training approaches across several diverse binary classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric presentation attack detection, and chest X-ray anomaly classification in both close-set and open-set scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating both true-class and false-class CAMs in saliency-guided training significantly enhances model generalization performance over methods that only use true-class CAMs, validating the hypothesis that leveraging the divergence between these CAMs on important features is beneficial for training robust deep learning models.

Abstract: Existing saliency-guided training approaches improve model generalization by
incorporating a loss term that compares the model's class activation map (CAM)
for a sample's true-class ({\it i.e.}, correct-label class) against a human
reference saliency map. However, prior work has ignored the false-class CAM(s),
that is the model's saliency obtained for incorrect-label class. We hypothesize
that in binary tasks the true and false CAMs should diverge on the important
classification features identified by humans (and reflected in human saliency
maps). We use this hypothesis to motivate three new saliency-guided training
methods incorporating both true- and false-class model's CAM into the training
strategy and a novel post-hoc tool for identifying important features. We
evaluate all introduced methods on several diverse binary close-set and
open-set classification tasks, including synthetic face detection, biometric
presentation attack detection, and classification of anomalies in chest X-ray
scans, and find that the proposed methods improve generalization capabilities
of deep learning models over traditional (true-class CAM only) saliency-guided
training approaches. We offer source codes and model weights\footnote{GitHub

*Gaston Gustavo Rios,Pedro Dal Bianco,Franco Ronchetti,Facundo Quiroga,Oscar Stanchi,Santiago Ponte Ahón,Waldo Hasperué*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper addresses the problem of limited and unbalanced sign language handshape datasets by using synthetic data generation with GANs (ReACGAN and SPADE) to augment training data, achieving 5% improvement in accuracy on the RWTH German sign language dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced, which poses significant challenges for effective model training. The scarcity and imbalance of real data hinders the development of robust handshape classifiers for sign language recognition systems.

Method: The authors use an EfficientNet classifier trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset and apply two GAN architectures for synthetic data generation: (1) ReACGAN - uses label information to condition data generation through an auxiliary classifier, and (2) SPADE - utilizes spatially-adaptive normalization to condition generation on pose information. Different strategies are explored to combine generated and real images for training.

Result: The proposed techniques improve state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%. The method demonstrates generalization capability across different sign language datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID dataset, achieving comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers without requiring generator retraining.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation using GANs effectively addresses the limitations of small and unbalanced sign language handshape datasets. The combination of ReACGAN and SPADE architectures successfully generates realistic handshape images that improve classifier performance and demonstrate cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Most sign language handshape datasets are severely limited and unbalanced,
posing significant challenges to effective model training. In this paper, we
explore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape
classifier by generating synthetic data. We use an EfficientNet classifier
trained on the RWTH German sign language handshape dataset, which is small and
heavily unbalanced, applying different strategies to combine generated and real
images. We compare two Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) architectures for
data generation: ReACGAN, which uses label information to condition the data
generation process through an auxiliary classifier, and SPADE, which utilizes
spatially-adaptive normalization to condition the generation on pose
information. ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align
with specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with
accurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the
current state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the
limitations of small and unbalanced datasets. Additionally, our method
demonstrates the capability to generalize across different sign language
datasets by leveraging pose-based generation trained on the extensive HaGRID
dataset. We achieve comparable performance to single-source trained classifiers
without the need for retraining the generator.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing number of satellites provides vast high-resolution imagery for spatial mapping, but reconstructing accurate building footprints remains challenging due to the complexity of primitives-based object representation in computer vision, often requiring labor-intensive manual processes.

Method: A novel deep learning approach using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that incorporates geometric regularity into building boundaries, integrates multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and embeds Attraction Field Maps into the network architecture.

Result: The proposed Decoupled-PolyGCN model outperforms existing methods by 6% in Average Precision (AP) and 10% in Average Recall (AR), delivering accurate and regularized building footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: The method provides a scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from single satellite images, enabling impactful applications in urban planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis.

Abstract: In recent years, the number of remote satellites orbiting the Earth has grown
significantly, streaming vast amounts of high-resolution visual data to support
diverse applications across civil, public, and military domains. Among these
applications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built
environment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed
imagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from
satellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of
high-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture
the built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable
advancements in object detection and representation using visual data,
primitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in
computer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on
labor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep
learning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address
these challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach
enhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building
boundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and
embedding Attraction Field Maps into the network. These innovations provide a
scalable and precise solution for automated building footprint extraction from
a single satellite image, paving the way for impactful applications in urban
planning, disaster management, and large-scale spatial analysis. Our model,
Decoupled-PolyGCN, outperforms existing methods by 6% in AP and 10% in AR,
demonstrating its ability to deliver accurate and regularized building
footprints across diverse and challenging scenarios.

*Kuleen Sasse,Efsun Sarioglu Kayi,Arun Reddy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a video understanding system that converts long-form videos into text-based summaries using progressive captioning, enabling large language models to answer complex queries about video content more efficiently than processing raw video data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form videos are extremely dense and high-dimensional, making them computationally expensive to process directly. Text-based summaries provide a more compact representation that can be easily processed by large language models for video question answering, but existing video captions focus mainly on human actions and miss other scene information.

Method: The authors develop a progressive text-based memory construction system using LaViLa video captioner on shorter video chunks, enhanced with static scene descriptions from LLaVA Vision Language Model. They explore video partitioning strategies and create a controllable hybrid captioner that can produce both action and scene captions based on special input tokens signaling scene changes.

Result: The system successfully incorporates static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline, creating more detailed and complete caption logs that expand the range of answerable questions. The fine-tuned controllable hybrid captioner significantly improves efficiency compared to using separate models for action and scene captioning.

Conclusion: The proposed video understanding system effectively addresses the challenge of processing long-form videos by creating enriched text-based memories that capture both actions and scene information, enabling better video question answering through LLMs while maintaining computational feasibility.

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and
high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to
represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video.
In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to
answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the
progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating
on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is
computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the
activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video
captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to
other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene
descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding
system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer
questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the
video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more
accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we
incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA
VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the
space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we
have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action
and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning
pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our
model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of
captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected
in the video.

*Tz-Ying Wu,Tahani Trigui,Sharath Nittur Sridhar,Anand Bodas,Subarna Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNarrator is a training-free pipeline that generates dense video captions with precise timestamps by combining multiple MLLMs and VLMs to reduce hallucinations and improve temporal alignment in video narrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video comprehension struggle with temporally aligned narrations and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios, creating a need for better video captioning solutions.

Method: A flexible training-free pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) functioning as caption generators, context providers, or caption verifiers in a synergistic interaction to generate dense video captions with detailed narrations and precise timestamps.

Result: The synergistic interaction of components significantly enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing hallucinations and improving temporal alignment compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: VideoNarrator provides a structured approach that enhances video understanding and facilitates downstream tasks such as video summarization and question answering, with potential extensions for advertising and marketing applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce VideoNarrator, a novel training-free pipeline
designed to generate dense video captions that offer a structured snapshot of
video content. These captions offer detailed narrations with precise
timestamps, capturing the nuances present in each segment of the video. Despite
advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for video
comprehension, these models often struggle with temporally aligned narrations
and tend to hallucinate, particularly in unfamiliar scenarios. VideoNarrator
addresses these challenges by leveraging a flexible pipeline where
off-the-shelf MLLMs and visual-language models (VLMs) can function as caption
generators, context providers, or caption verifiers. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the synergistic interaction of these components significantly
enhances the quality and accuracy of video narrations, effectively reducing
hallucinations and improving temporal alignment. This structured approach not
only enhances video understanding but also facilitates downstream tasks such as
video summarization and video question answering, and can be potentially
extended for advertising and marketing applications.

### [50] [Few-Shot Learning in Video and 3D Object Detection: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17079)
*Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Kendall N. Niles,Joe Tom,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Elias Ioup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This survey examines few-shot learning advances for video and 3D object detection, showing how FSL can reduce expensive manual annotation requirements by enabling models to recognize novel classes from just a few examples, with applications in autonomous driving and video analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual data labeling for object detection is expensive and time-consuming, especially for video (annotating across frames) and 3D data (costly 3D annotations). Few-shot learning offers a solution by enabling models to recognize novel classes with minimal annotated examples, making deployment more practical for real-world applications like autonomous driving.

Method: The paper surveys FSL techniques across two domains: (1) Video detection using tube proposals and temporal matching networks that leverage spatiotemporal structure across frames, and (2) 3D detection integrating FSL with specialized point cloud networks and class imbalance-tailored losses to handle LiDAR/depth data sparsity and lack of texture.

Result: FSL techniques successfully enable object detection in both video and 3D domains with reduced annotation requirements. Video FSL efficiently propagates information across frames to detect new classes from few examples. 3D FSL addresses challenges of sparse point clouds and enables practical autonomous driving deployment by minimizing 3D annotation needs.

Conclusion: Few-shot learning shows significant promise for reducing annotation requirements in object detection by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal, and data modalities. The comprehensive survey reveals FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable practical deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications, though challenges remain in balancing generalization vs. overfitting and integrating prototype matching.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) enables object detection models to recognize novel
classes given only a few annotated examples, thereby reducing expensive manual
data labeling. This survey examines recent FSL advances for video and 3D object
detection. For video, FSL is especially valuable since annotating objects
across frames is more laborious than for static images. By propagating
information across frames, techniques like tube proposals and temporal matching
networks can detect new classes from a couple examples, efficiently leveraging
spatiotemporal structure. FSL for 3D detection from LiDAR or depth data faces
challenges like sparsity and lack of texture. Solutions integrate FSL with
specialized point cloud networks and losses tailored for class imbalance.
Few-shot 3D detection enables practical autonomous driving deployment by
minimizing costly 3D annotation needs. Core issues in both domains include
balancing generalization and overfitting, integrating prototype matching, and
handling data modality properties. In summary, FSL shows promise for reducing
annotation requirements and enabling real-world video, 3D, and other
applications by efficiently leveraging information across feature, temporal,
and data modalities. By comprehensively surveying recent advancements, this
paper illuminates FSL's potential to minimize supervision needs and enable
deployment across video, 3D, and other real-world applications.

*Zaipeng Duan,Chenxu Dang,Xuzhong Hu,Pei An,Junfeng Ding,Jie Zhan,Yunbiao Xu,Jie Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes SDG-OCC, a novel multimodal 3D occupancy prediction network that combines camera and LiDAR data through enhanced view transformation and active distillation to achieve state-of-the-art real-time performance for autonomous driving applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D occupancy prediction methods have limitations: camera-based methods lack depth information while LiDAR-based methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods using Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and fail to fully exploit geometric and semantic information of 3D LiDAR points.

Method: The paper introduces SDG-OCC with two key components: (1) joint semantic and depth-guided view transformation that constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization, and (2) fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation that extracts semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Two variants are proposed: SDG-Fusion (fusion only) and SDG-KL (fusion + distillation).

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across different benchmarks.

Conclusion: SDG-OCC successfully addresses the limitations of existing single-modality approaches by effectively combining camera and LiDAR data through enhanced view transformation and active distillation, achieving superior performance while maintaining real-time inference capabilities for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its
potential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are
single-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based
methods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on
the Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth
estimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of
3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction
network called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided
view transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth
distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through
diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active
distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and
selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified
regions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses
fusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for
faster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with
real-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable
performance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating
its effectiveness and robustness. The code will be released at
https://github.com/DzpLab/SDGOCC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models require fine-tuning at scale but face challenges in federated environments with decentralized, non-iid data across clients. Existing parameter-efficient methods like LoRA struggle with heterogeneous client data, leading to suboptimal generalization and requiring better solutions for federated VLM adaptation.

Method: The authors develop FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized VLM adaptation while preserving privacy. They introduce personalized LoRA (pLoRA) that dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each client's unique data distribution, allowing local adaptation while maintaining global model aggregation capabilities.

Result: Experiments on the RLAIF-V dataset demonstrate that pLoRA improves client-specific performance by 24.5% compared to standard LoRA, showing superior adaptation capabilities in non-iid federated learning settings.

Conclusion: FedVLM provides a scalable and efficient solution for fine-tuning vision-language models in federated settings, successfully advancing personalized adaptation in distributed learning scenarios while maintaining model privacy and reducing centralized training requirements.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot and few-shot
learning capabilities, making them essential for several downstream tasks.
However, fine-tuning these models at scale remains challenging, particularly in
federated environments where data is decentralized and non-iid across clients.
Existing parameter-efficient tuning methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
reduce computational overhead but struggle with heterogeneous client data,

FedVLM, a federated LoRA fine-tuning framework that enables decentralized

personalized LoRA (pLoRA), which dynamically adapts LoRA parameters to each

### [53] [IONext: Unlocking the Next Era of Inertial Odometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17089)
*Shanshan Zhang,Siyue Wang,Tianshui Wen,Qi Zhang,Ziheng Zhou,Lingxiang Zheng,Yu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes IONext, a CNN-based inertial odometry model that uses Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM) and Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU) to capture both global and local motion features, outperforming existing Transformer and CNN methods on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Transformer-based models excel at long-range dependencies for inertial odometry, they have limited sensitivity to local motion variations and lack inductive biases, hindering localization accuracy. Existing CNN approaches also have limitations in temporal modeling that need to be addressed.

Method: The authors propose IONext, built on two key components: (1) Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM) that adaptively captures global and local motion features through dynamic weight generation and multi-scale feature aggregation, and (2) Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU) that selectively extracts representative motion features in the temporal domain to improve temporal modeling.

Result: IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Transformer and CNN-based methods across six public datasets. On the RNIN dataset specifically, it reduces average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 10% and average Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 12% compared to the representative iMOT model.

Conclusion: The proposed IONext architecture successfully combines the advantages of CNNs with adaptive mechanisms to achieve superior performance in inertial odometry tasks, demonstrating that well-designed CNN architectures can outperform Transformer-based approaches for this specific application.

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial
odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their
limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of
inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and
generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel
convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can
effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion
perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module
called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures
both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from
dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on
the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further
improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),
which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in
the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling
observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new
CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry
(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based
methods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by
10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.

*Bo Fang,Jianan Fan,Dongnan Liu,Hang Chang,Gerald J. Shami,Filip Braet,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScSAM enhances subcellular organelle segmentation by combining SAM with MAE-guided cellular prior knowledge to address morphological variability and feature bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance through feature alignment and class-specific prompt encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subcellular organelle segmentation faces challenges due to significant morphological and distributional variability among components, leading to biased feature learning in existing methods. SAM, while providing rich features, struggles with label space gaps and lacks fine-grained spatial detail capture for subtle subcellular structures.

Method: The paper introduces ScSAM, which fuses pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge. Key components include: (1) a feature alignment and fusion module to align embeddings to the same feature space and combine different representations, and (2) a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate class-specific features for subcellular category recognition.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in organelle segmentation tasks, showing improved feature robustness and reduced training bias from data imbalance.

Conclusion: ScSAM successfully addresses the key challenges in subcellular organelle segmentation by effectively combining SAM's global contextual understanding with MAE-guided cellular priors, resulting in enhanced feature robustness and superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The significant morphological and distributional variability among
subcellular components poses a long-standing challenge for learning-based
organelle segmentation models, significantly increasing the risk of biased
feature learning. Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,
overlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its
application to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The
variability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the
label space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM
focuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained
spatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations
and cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we
introduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing
pre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge
to alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a
feature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same
feature space and efficiently combine different representations. Moreover, we
present a cosine similarity matrix-based class prompt encoder to activate
class-specific features to recognize subcellular categories. Extensive
experiments on diverse subcellular image datasets demonstrate that ScSAM
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

### [56] [UNICE: Training A Universal Image Contrast Enhancer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17157)
*Ruodai Cui,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNICE is a universal image contrast enhancement method that generates multi-exposure sequences from single images and fuses them to create enhanced outputs, achieving better generalization across different contrast enhancement tasks without requiring manual labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are task-specific and show poor generalization across different tasks and datasets. The authors aim to develop a universal model that can handle various contrast enhancement tasks by leveraging the common need for exposure and contrast adjustment.

Method: The method involves two main steps: (1) collecting 46,928 HDR raw images to render 328,496 sRGB images and build multi-exposure sequences (MES) with pseudo ground-truths via multi-exposure fusion, (2) training a two-stage network where the first network generates MES from a single sRGB image and the second network fuses the generated MES into an enhanced image.

Result: UNICE demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing methods across different contrast enhancement tasks and datasets. It outperforms manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image quality metrics while being free of costly human labeling.

Conclusion: The paper successfully develops a universal image contrast enhancement method that addresses the generalization limitations of existing task-specific approaches by leveraging multi-exposure fusion techniques and HDR data, achieving superior performance without manual annotation.

Abstract: Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for
specific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit
image enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor
generalization performance across different tasks, even across different
datasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a
universal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this
work, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of
exposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic
range (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from
public sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure
sequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via
multi-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from
a single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated
MES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image
Contrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it
demonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing
image contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even
outperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image
quality metrics. The dataset, code and model are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces DOOMGAN, a novel GAN-based method for generating morphing attacks on visible-spectrum ocular biometrics, achieving significantly higher attack success rates while maintaining realistic iris structures and gaze consistency compared to baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While morphing attacks have been extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face biometrics, visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored. Current methods struggle to handle uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris boundaries and periocular textures, creating a security vulnerability in ocular biometric systems.

Method: DOOMGAN employs three key components: (1) landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy to capture structural features, (2) attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis that focuses on important regions, and (3) dynamic weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence during training.

Result: DOOMGAN achieves over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent thresholds, demonstrates 20% better elliptical iris structure generation, and shows 30% improved gaze consistency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses the gap in visible-spectrum ocular morphing attacks by developing an effective generation model that significantly outperforms existing methods. Additionally, the authors contribute the first comprehensive ocular morphing dataset to facilitate future research in this critical security domain.

Abstract: Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent
modality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive
nature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by
blending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system
integrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face
biometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.
Simulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle
uncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris
boundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,
that encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,
attention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic
weighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves
over 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent
thresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%
improved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular
morphing dataset to support further research in this domain.

*Li Pingzhen,Xu Sheng,Chen Jing,Su Chengyue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved YOLOv8-based multi-scale PCB defect detection method that combines tiny target sensitivity strategy, network lightweighting, and adaptive pruning to achieve high accuracy and real-time detection of small PCB defects while reducing computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PCB defect detection models struggle to balance accuracy and computational cost due to high-density PCB designs and high-speed production requirements. Existing methods cannot meet the demands for high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects simultaneously.

Method: The method improves YOLOv8 through: (1) Ghost-HGNetv2 backbone with fewer parameters for multilevel feature extraction, (2) C2f-Faster integration in neck section for enhanced multi-level feature fusion, (3) GCDetect detection head using GroupConv weight sharing for regression and classification, (4) Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function for better tiny target detection, and (5) adaptive pruning rate optimization to reduce model complexity.

Result: On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, the model achieves mAP0.5 of 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 of 75.18%, representing a 10.13% improvement compared to YOLOv8n. The model demonstrates advantages in both accuracy and speed while maintaining real-time detection capabilities.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-scale PCB defect detection method successfully addresses the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency by integrating lightweight network architectures, enhanced feature fusion, optimized detection heads, improved loss functions, and adaptive pruning, making it suitable for high-accuracy real-time PCB defect detection in industrial applications.

Abstract: With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high
speed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to
take into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the
requirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.
Therefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved
with YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,
network lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the
detection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck
network and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning
rate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the
backbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic
features to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with
small number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of
multi-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect
detection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to
share the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping
convolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which
significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy
of detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve
the detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned
by an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the
model. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of
accuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5
reaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared
to YOLOv8n.

*Linghe Meng,Jiarun Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multi-level visual representation paradigm for AI-generated content quality assessment, developing two networks (MGLF-Net and MPEF-Net) that extract and fuse features at multiple levels to better evaluate both perceptual quality and text-to-image correspondence in AIGC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AIGC quality assessment methods rely on single-level visual features, which limits their ability to capture complex distortions and handle multi-dimensional challenges spanning from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic understanding in AI-generated images.

Method: A multi-level visual representation paradigm with three stages: (1) multi-level feature extraction, (2) hierarchical fusion, and (3) joint aggregation. Two networks are developed: MGLF-Net using dual CNN and Transformer backbones for perceptual quality assessment, and MPEF-Net embedding prompt semantics into visual feature fusion for text-to-image correspondence evaluation.

Result: Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate outstanding performance on both perceptual quality assessment and text-to-image correspondence evaluation tasks, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The multi-level visual assessment paradigm successfully addresses the limitations of single-level feature approaches by capturing complex distortions across multiple representation levels, validating its effectiveness for comprehensive AIGC quality assessment through superior experimental performance.

Abstract: The quality assessment of AI-generated content (AIGC) faces multi-dimensional
challenges, that span from low-level visual perception to high-level semantic
understanding. Existing methods generally rely on single-level visual features,
limiting their ability to capture complex distortions in AIGC images. To
address this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is
proposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical
fusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are
developed. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)
is designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary
local and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The
Multi-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image
correspondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion
process at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then
aggregated for final evaluation. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate
outstanding performance on both tasks, validating the effectiveness of the

*M. A. Rasel,Sameem Abdul Kareem,Zhenli Kwan,Nik Aimee Azizah Faheem,Winn Hui Han,Rebecca Kai Jan Choong,Shin Shen Yong,Unaizah Obaidellah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a hybrid approach combining geometric analysis and CNN-based feature extraction to classify dermoscopic lesion shapes (asymmetric, half-symmetric, symmetric) for melanoma diagnosis, achieving 99% detection rate for asymmetric lesions and 94% Kappa score for multiclass classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asymmetric lesion shape is a critical clinical criterion for melanoma diagnosis in dermoscopic images. The study aims to develop automated tools to help non-experts understand and identify asymmetric lesions, addressing the need for objective assessment of lesion symmetry in skin cancer detection.

Method: The authors first labeled a non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical assessments. They then developed a two-pronged approach: (1) a supervised learning image processing algorithm for geometric pattern analysis of lesion shapes, and (2) a pre-trained CNN to extract shape, color, and texture features, followed by training a multiclass SVM classifier for lesion shape classification.

Result: The geometry-based experiment achieved 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. The CNN-based approach achieved 94% Kappa Score, 95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes into three categories (Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric), outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach successfully combines geometric analysis with deep learning features to provide accurate lesion shape classification in dermoscopic images. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing literature and offers a valuable tool for assisting non-experts in melanoma diagnosis by automating the assessment of lesion asymmetry.

Abstract: In dermoscopic images, which allow visualization of surface skin structures
not visible to the naked eye, lesion shape offers vital insights into skin
diseases. In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of
the criteria for diagnosing melanoma. Initially, we labeled data for a
non-annotated dataset with symmetrical information based on clinical
assessments. Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised
learning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of
lesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric
lesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to
extract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training
a multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,
we achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions. In
the CNN-based experiment, the best performance is found with 94% Kappa Score,
95% Macro F1-score, and 97% Weighted F1-score for classifying lesion shapes
(Asymmetric, Half-Symmetric, and Symmetric).

### [61] [Vec2Face+ for Face Dataset Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17192)
*Haiyu Wu,Jaskirat Singh,Sicong Tian,Liang Zheng,Kevin W. Bowyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Vec2Face+, a generative model that creates synthetic face datasets with improved identity consistency and attribute variation, achieving state-of-the-art face recognition performance that surpasses real-world datasets like CASIA-WebFace for the first time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing face synthesis methods for training data generation focus on inter-class separability and intra-class attribute variation but overlook the critical need to maintain intra-class identity consistency, leading to suboptimal synthetic datasets for face recognition training.

Method: Vec2Face+ generates images directly from image features with three key strategies: 1) sampling sufficiently different vectors for well-separated identities, 2) AttrOP algorithm for increasing general attribute variations, and 3) LoRA-based pose control for efficient and identity-preserving profile head pose generation.

Result: The generated VFace datasets (10K, 100K, 300K identities) achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets, with VFace100K and VFace300K outperforming the real-world CASIA-WebFace dataset on five test sets - marking the first time synthetic data beats CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy.

Conclusion: Vec2Face+ successfully demonstrates that synthetic face datasets can surpass real-world datasets in face recognition performance when proper identity consistency is maintained alongside attribute variation. However, the study reveals concerning issues with twin verification performance and increased bias in models trained on synthetic identities that require future investigation.

Abstract: When synthesizing identities as face recognition training data, it is
generally believed that large inter-class separability and intra-class
attribute variation are essential for synthesizing a quality dataset. % This
belief is generally correct, and this is what we aim for. However, when
increasing intra-class variation, existing methods overlook the necessity of
maintaining intra-class identity consistency. % To address this and generate
high-quality face training data, we propose Vec2Face+, a generative model that
creates images directly from image features and allows for continuous and easy
control of face identities and attributes. Using Vec2Face+, we obtain datasets
with proper inter-class separability and intra-class variation and identity
consistency using three strategies: 1) we sample vectors sufficiently different
from others to generate well-separated identities; 2) we propose an AttrOP
algorithm for increasing general attribute variations; 3) we propose LoRA-based
pose control for generating images with profile head poses, which is more
efficient and identity-preserving than AttrOP. % Our system generates VFace10K,
a synthetic face dataset with 10K identities, which allows an FR model to
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on seven real-world test sets. Scaling the
size to 4M and 12M images, the corresponding VFace100K and VFace300K datasets
yield higher accuracy than the real-world training dataset, CASIA-WebFace, on
five real-world test sets. This is the first time a synthetic dataset beats the
CASIA-WebFace in average accuracy. In addition, we find that only 1 out of 11
synthetic datasets outperforms random guessing (\emph{i.e., 50\%}) in twin
verification and that models trained with synthetic identities are more biased
than those trained with real identities. Both are important aspects for future
investigation.

### [62] [DesignLab: Designing Slides Through Iterative Detection and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17202)
*Jooyeol Yun,Heng Wang,Yotaro Shimose,Jaegul Choo,Shingo Takamatsu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DesignLab proposes a two-role system (design reviewer and design contributor) that iteratively improves presentation slides through continuous issue detection and correction, outperforming existing automated design tools by mimicking real-world design workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated slide design tools lack the ability to refine their own output, which is crucial in real-world design workflows. Non-experts struggle with the complexity of design choices, and current tools cannot iteratively improve their suggestions.

Method: The approach separates the design process into two distinct roles: a design reviewer (identifies design issues) and a design contributor (corrects identified issues). Large language models are fine-tuned for both roles, and intermediate drafts are simulated using controlled perturbations to train the models on design error detection and correction.

Result: DesignLab outperforms existing design-generation methods, including commercial tools, by producing polished and professional slides through its iterative refinement process that reaches qualities previously unattainable by single-pass methods.

Conclusion: The iterative two-role approach successfully mimics real-world design workflows, enabling automated tools to continuously improve slide designs through multiple refinement cycles, resulting in higher quality professional presentations than existing automated design methods.

Abstract: Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts
due to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous
automated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the
ability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world
workflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two
roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled
perturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the
contributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab
outperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by
embracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,
professional slides.

Motivation: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is labor-intensive for dental technicians, creating a need for automated solutions to streamline the dental crown design process.

Method: A voxel-based framework (VBCD) that: 1) generates initial coarse dental crowns from voxelized intraoral scans, 2) applies fine-grained refinement with distance-aware supervision, 3) uses Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) for better margin line alignment, and 4) incorporates positional prompts based on FDI tooth numbering system for improved accuracy.

Result: The proposed VBCD framework outperforms existing methods when evaluated on a large-scale dataset of intraoral scans, demonstrating superior accuracy and quality in automated dental crown design.

Conclusion: The VBCD framework provides a robust solution for personalized dental crown design, successfully addressing the labor-intensive nature of manual crown design while achieving better performance than existing automated methods.

Abstract: The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is
labor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design (VBCD). The VBCD
framework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral
scans, followed by a fine-grained refiner incorporating distance-aware
supervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we
employ the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the
alignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a
positional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to
further improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a
large-scale dataset of intraoral scans demonstrated that our approach
outperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for personalized
dental crown design.

*Fatemeh Hasanzadeh Fard,Sanaz Hasanzadeh Fard,Mehdi Jonoobi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study develops a cost-effective machine learning solution using YOLOv5 and standard RGB images to automatically detect and measure timber log diameter in real-world industrial conditions, achieving 0.64 mAP@0.5 without requiring expensive sensors or controlled environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional wood processing relies on expert human labor for species and thickness identification, which is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone when processing large volumes. The industry needs accurate and efficient automated solutions that work in real-world conditions without expensive equipment.

Method: The researchers employed YOLOv5 object detection algorithm fine-tuned on the TimberSeg 1.0 public dataset. The model uses standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions in typical industrial sheds during timber delivery to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness through bounding-box dimensions.

Result: The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating reliable log detection performance even with modest computing resources. The solution works effectively in real industrial environments without requiring expensive sensors or controlled conditions.

Conclusion: This lightweight, scalable solution shows promise for practical integration into existing workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting, particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized operations in the wood processing industry.

Abstract: The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and
MDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species
and thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert
human labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when
processing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective
machine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter
using standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We
employ the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset
(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness
through bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive
sensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in
typical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that
the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating
reliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,
scalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing
workflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,
particularly in small and medium-sized operations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIG-Nav introduces a pretrained vision-based navigation model that uses early-fusion ViT architecture and auxiliary tasks, achieving 22.6% improvement in zero-shot and 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings over existing models while requiring less labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pretrained foundation models for vision-based robotic navigation lack effective design strategies and sufficient training data diversity. The goal is to achieve better generalizable navigation with positive transfer across environments and enhanced zero-shot performance in unseen settings.

Method: The approach includes two key model design choices: (1) early-fusion network structure combining visual observations and goal images via pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2) auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation representation learning. Additionally, a novel data preprocessing pipeline efficiently labels large-scale game video datasets to augment existing navigation datasets.

Result: PIG-Nav achieves 22.6% average improvement in zero-shot settings and 37.5% improvement in fine-tuning settings compared to existing visual navigation foundation models. Performance was evaluated across two complex simulated environments and one real-world environment, with the model maintaining competitive performance while requiring significantly less fine-tuning data.

Conclusion: The work advances state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models through effective architectural design and data augmentation strategies. The model's ability to maintain strong performance with minimal labeled supervision highlights its potential for practical real-world deployment in robotic navigation applications.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored pretrained (foundation) models for vision-based
robotic navigation, aiming to achieve generalizable navigation and positive
transfer across diverse environments while enhancing zero-shot performance in
unseen settings. In this work, we introduce PIG-Nav (Pretrained Image-Goal
Navigation), a new approach that further investigates pretraining strategies
for vision-based navigation models and contributes in two key areas.
Model-wise, we identify two critical design choices that consistently improve
the performance of pretrained navigation models: (1) integrating an
early-fusion network structure to combine visual observations and goal images
via appropriately pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) image encoder, and (2)
introducing suitable auxiliary tasks to enhance global navigation
representation learning, thus further improving navigation performance.
Dataset-wise, we propose a novel data preprocessing pipeline for efficiently
labeling large-scale game video datasets for navigation model training. We
demonstrate that augmenting existing open navigation datasets with diverse
gameplay videos improves model performance. Our model achieves an average
improvement of 22.6% in zero-shot settings and a 37.5% improvement in
fine-tuning settings over existing visual navigation foundation models in two
complex simulated environments and one real-world environment. These results
advance the state-of-the-art in pretrained image-goal navigation models.
Notably, our model maintains competitive performance while requiring
significantly less fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential for real-world
deployment with minimal labeled supervision.

### [66] [MaskedCLIP: Bridging the Masked and CLIP Space for Semi-Supervised Medical Vision-Language Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17239)
*Lei Zhu,Jun Zhou,Rick Siow Mong Goh,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MaskedCLIP, a framework that combines masked image modeling with contrastive language-image pre-training to leverage both paired and unpaired medical image data for learning more generalizable foundation models in medical image analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models in medical image analysis are limited by using either paired image-text data or unpaired image data exclusively, which restricts their ability to learn comprehensive image features. There's a need to harness the potential of both data types simultaneously for better foundation model learning.

Method: The authors propose MaskedCLIP, which combines masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The framework uses a bridge transformer to connect incompatible feature spaces from paired and unpaired data, and employs masked knowledge distillation loss to transfer semantic knowledge between CLIP and masked feature spaces.

Result: Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of the proposed method, showing improved performance on downstream tasks compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: MaskedCLIP successfully addresses the challenge of combining paired and unpaired image data by bridging incompatible feature spaces, enabling more generalizable image feature learning for medical image analysis foundation models through mutually interactive design between masked modeling and contrastive learning.

Abstract: Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image
analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via
vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised
pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to
boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models
exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to
learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we
investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,
aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data
for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a
synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training
framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge
in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model
lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.
To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the
CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic
specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for
semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation
loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature
space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With
this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both
paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for
downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.

*Krishna Srikar Durbha,Asvin Kumar Venkataramanan,Rajesh Sureddi,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes using Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models to detect AI-generated images by leveraging their ability to capture the manifold of real images in a statistical feature space, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a simple two-layer network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rapid advancement of generative AI models leading to an influx of GenAI content on the internet, there is a critical need for robust methods to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Existing detection methods need improvement in generalization performance across unseen generative models.

Method: The authors leverage existing IQA models that capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass statistical space. They train a simple two-layer network on the feature space extracted from IQA models to classify images as real or AI-generated, and evaluate the approach's generalization ability and robustness against image degradations.

Result: The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in detecting fake images across different generative models while maintaining significant robustness against various image degradations. The simple two-layer network architecture proves effective when built upon IQA model features.

Conclusion: IQA models provide an effective foundation for GenAI image detection due to their inherent understanding of real image statistics. The proposed approach offers superior generalization across unseen generative models and maintains robustness against image quality degradations, making it suitable for practical deployment in image processing pipelines.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) models are employed in many practical image
and video processing pipelines to reduce storage, minimize transmission costs,
and improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) of millions of viewers. These
models are sensitive to a diverse range of image distortions and can accurately
predict image quality as judged by human viewers. Recent advancements in
generative models have resulted in a significant influx of "GenAI" content on
the internet. Existing methods for detecting GenAI content have progressed
significantly with improved generalization performance on images from unseen
generative models. Here, we leverage the capabilities of existing IQA models,
which effectively capture the manifold of real images within a bandpass
statistical space, to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. We
investigate the generalization ability of these perceptual classifiers to the
task of GenAI image detection and evaluate their robustness against various
image degradations. Our results show that a two-layer network trained on the
feature space of IQA models demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in
detecting fake images across generative models, while maintaining significant
robustness against image degradations.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified license plate recognition system that combines a lightweight visual encoder with text decoder and perspective correction network, achieving 99.34-99.58% accuracy on single-line and 98.70% on double-line Chinese license plates at 167 FPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN and CRNN-based license plate recognition approaches face limitations in handling diverse license plate types and imaging conditions in open environments, particularly for single and double-line Chinese license plates where double-line datasets are scarce.

Method: The authors develop a unified framework integrating: (1) a lightweight visual encoder with text decoder in a pre-training setup, (2) a synthesized dataset combining synthetic images, texture mapping on real scenes, and authentic license plate images, and (3) a perspective correction network (PTN) using corner coordinate regression supervised by view classification information.

Result: The system achieves 99.34% accuracy on corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance, 99.58% under fine localization disturbance, and 98.70% on double-line license plates, with processing speeds up to 167 frames per second.

Conclusion: The proposed unified solution effectively addresses license plate recognition challenges through improved architecture design and perspective correction, demonstrating strong practical applicability with high accuracy and real-time processing capabilities for both single and double-line Chinese license plates.

Abstract: License plate recognition in open environments is widely applicable across
various domains; however, the diversity of license plate types and imaging
conditions presents significant challenges. To address the limitations
encountered by CNN and CRNN-based approaches in license plate recognition, this
paper proposes a unified solution that integrates a lightweight visual encoder
with a text decoder, within a pre-training framework tailored for single and
double-line Chinese license plates. To mitigate the scarcity of double-line
license plate datasets, we constructed a single/double-line license plate
dataset by synthesizing images, applying texture mapping onto real scenes, and
blending them with authentic license plate images. Furthermore, to enhance the
system's recognition accuracy, we introduce a perspective correction network
(PTN) that employs license plate corner coordinate regression as an implicit
variable, supervised by license plate view classification information. This
network offers improved stability, interpretability, and low annotation costs.
The proposed algorithm achieves an average recognition accuracy of 99.34% on
the corrected CCPD test set under coarse localization disturbance. When
evaluated under fine localization disturbance, the accuracy further improves to
99.58%. On the double-line license plate test set, it achieves an average
recognition accuracy of 98.70%, with processing speeds reaching up to 167
frames per second, indicating strong practical applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces an Unsupervised Exposure Correction (UEC) method that eliminates manual annotation requirements, improves generalizability, and enhances performance in low-level computer vision tasks using an emulated ISP pipeline and a large-scale radiometry correction dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current exposure correction methods face three key challenges: labor-intensive paired data annotation, limited generalizability, and performance degradation in low-level computer vision tasks. These limitations stem from expensive manual annotations and individual style biases that affect model performance.

Method: The authors develop an unsupervised exposure correction approach that uses freely available paired data from an emulated Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline instead of manual annotations. They create a large-scale Radiometry Correction Dataset emphasizing exposure variations and develop a transformation function that preserves image details while using only 0.01% of the parameters compared to supervised methods.

Result: The proposed UEC method outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods while being extremely parameter-efficient (using only 0.01% of their parameters). The method demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating adverse effects of poor exposure on low-level features and shows improved performance in downstream tasks like edge detection.

Conclusion: The unsupervised exposure correction method successfully addresses the limitations of existing approaches by eliminating annotation requirements, improving generalizability through reduced style bias, and enhancing performance in low-level computer vision tasks. The method's parameter efficiency and effectiveness on downstream tasks demonstrate its practical value for real-world applications.

*Asir Saadat,Syem Aziz,Shahriar Mahmud,Abdullah Ibne Masud Mahi,Sabbir Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces VisionTrap, a dataset to test whether Visual Language Models (VLMs) can properly abstain from answering unanswerable questions about unrealistic images, revealing that current VQA benchmarks lack evaluation of models' ability to recognize their knowledge limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA research focuses primarily on answerable questions with real-world images, with limited exploration of how models handle unanswerable questions or recognize when they should abstain from responding, which is crucial for reliable AI systems.

Method: The researchers created VisionTrap dataset with three categories of unanswerable questions: (1) hybrid entities combining objects and animals, (2) objects in unconventional/impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional/non-existent figures. They tested VLMs on these logically structured but inherently unanswerable questions to assess abstention behavior.

Result: The findings reveal that current VLMs struggle to properly abstain from answering unanswerable questions, often attempting to generate responses even when they should recognize their knowledge limitations and refrain from answering.

Conclusion: The study emphasizes the critical need to incorporate unanswerable questions into VQA benchmarks to properly evaluate whether models can recognize their limitations and abstain appropriately, rather than always attempting to provide answers regardless of question answerability.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) has been a widely studied topic, with
extensive research focusing on how VLMs respond to answerable questions based
on real-world images. However, there has been limited exploration of how these
models handle unanswerable questions, particularly in cases where they should
abstain from providing a response. This research investigates VQA performance
on unrealistically generated images or asking unanswerable questions, assessing
whether models recognize the limitations of their knowledge or attempt to
generate incorrect answers. We introduced a dataset, VisionTrap, comprising
three categories of unanswerable questions across diverse image types: (1)
hybrid entities that fuse objects and animals, (2) objects depicted in
unconventional or impossible scenarios, and (3) fictional or non-existent
figures. The questions posed are logically structured yet inherently
unanswerable, testing whether models can correctly recognize their limitations.
Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating such questions into VQA
benchmarks to evaluate whether models tend to answer, even when they should
abstain.

### [71] [URPO: A Unified Reward & Policy Optimization Framework for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17515)
*Songshuo Lu,Hua Wang,Zhi Chen,Yaohua Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: URPO is a novel framework that unifies instruction-following and reward modeling in a single model, eliminating the need for separate reward models and achieving superior performance through co-evolutionary training of generation and evaluation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically use separate policy and reward models, creating complex, resource-intensive workflows with performance limitations due to static reward signals. The separation between these components creates inefficiencies and performance ceilings.

Method: URPO (Unified Reward & Policy Optimization) recasts all alignment data (preference pairs, verifiable reasoning, open-ended instructions) into a unified generative format optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop, enabling the model to learn from ground-truth preferences while generating its own rewards.

Result: On Qwen2.5-7B, URPO significantly outperformed baselines: AlpacaEval instruction-following score improved from 42.24 to 44.84, composite reasoning average increased from 32.66 to 35.66, and achieved a RewardBench score of 85.15, surpassing the dedicated reward model (83.55).

Conclusion: URPO presents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective approach to language model alignment by eliminating separate reward models and fostering co-evolutionary dynamics between generation and evaluation, resulting in superior internal evaluation capabilities as a byproduct.

Abstract: Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a
separately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during
reinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,
resource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a
static reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy
Optimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following ("player") and reward
modeling ("referee") within a single model and a single training phase. Our
method recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable
reasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format
optimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This
enables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic
while simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.
Experiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified
model significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative
reward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24
to 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,
URPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,
achieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward

*Kailong Zhang,Youwei Lyu,Heng Guo,Si Li,Zhanyu Ma,Boxin Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarAnything is a diffusion-based method that synthesizes photorealistic polarization images from a single RGB input, eliminating the need for extensive 3D assets while maintaining physical accuracy for downstream applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders broader application of polarization imaging in enhancement and 3D reconstruction. Existing polarization simulators like Mitsuba require extensive 3D assets and parametric models, preventing large-scale photorealistic image generation.

Method: A diffusion-based generative framework that leverages pretrained diffusion models' zero-shot performance, combined with an effective representation strategy to preserve polarization property fidelity while synthesizing from single RGB inputs.

Result: The model generates high-quality polarization images with both photorealism and physical accuracy, and successfully supports downstream tasks such as shape from polarization reconstruction.

Conclusion: PolarAnything successfully addresses the limitations of existing polarization image synthesis by providing a practical solution that generates physically accurate polarization images from minimal input requirements, enabling broader applications in computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Polarization images facilitate image enhancement and 3D reconstruction tasks,
but the limited accessibility of polarization cameras hinders their broader
application. This gap drives the need for synthesizing photorealistic
polarization images.The existing polarization simulator Mitsuba relies on a
parametric polarization image formation model and requires extensive 3D assets
covering shape and PBR materials, preventing it from generating large-scale
photorealistic images. To address this problem, we propose PolarAnything,
capable of synthesizing polarization images from a single RGB input with both
photorealism and physical accuracy, eliminating the dependency on 3D asset
collections. Drawing inspiration from the zero-shot performance of pretrained
diffusion models, we introduce a diffusion-based generative framework with an
effective representation strategy that preserves the fidelity of polarization
properties. Experiments show that our model generates high-quality polarization
images and supports downstream tasks like shape from polarization.

*Huanli Zhuo,Leilei Ma,Haifeng Zhao,Shiwei Zhou,Dengdi Sun,Yanping Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FA-SAM is a single-source domain generalization framework that enables fully automated medical image segmentation using SAM by automatically generating prompts and reducing sensitivity to poor prompts through uncertainty modeling and multi-scale feature fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM-based medical image segmentation models face two major challenges: (1) dependence on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts that prevent fully automated segmentation and limit clinical application, and (2) poor prompts can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results, affecting segmentation accuracy.

Method: The paper proposes FA-SAM with two key innovations: (1) Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch with Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module that models uncertainty distribution of shallow features to automatically generate bounding box prompts, and (2) Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into SAM mask decoder that fuses multiscale information from SAM image and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details.

Result: Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate the effectiveness of FA-SAM in achieving fully automated medical image segmentation while maintaining robustness against poor prompts in cross-domain scenarios.

Conclusion: FA-SAM successfully addresses the key limitations of SAM-based medical image segmentation by enabling fully automated operation and reducing sensitivity to prompt quality, demonstrating potential for practical clinical applications in cross-domain medical image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical
image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in
cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,
the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated
prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image
segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,
providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)
to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask
results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain
generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully
automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted
Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty
Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module
integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty
distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding
box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with
SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image
embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the
target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive
experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate
the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above
challenges.

*Jie Wang,Zhendong Yang,Liansong Zong,Xiaobo Zhang,Dexian Wang,Ji Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2P-MMT is a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework that improves multimodal machine translation by using reconstructed images from diffusion models instead of original images, making it more robust to visual noise while maintaining translation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal machine translation (MMT) approaches have two main limitations: they require paired image-text inputs at inference time and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which reduces their robustness and practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes D2P-MMT, which uses only source text and reconstructed images generated by pre-trained diffusion models. The framework employs a dual-branch prompting strategy that jointly learns from both authentic and reconstructed images during training. A distributional alignment loss is introduced to enforce consistency between output distributions of the two branches and bridge the modality gap.

Result: Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset show that D2P-MMT achieves superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art MMT approaches, demonstrating improved robustness while maintaining high translation quality.

Conclusion: D2P-MMT successfully addresses the key limitations of existing MMT systems by using diffusion-generated images that filter out distracting visual details while preserving semantic information. The dual-branch training strategy and distributional alignment loss effectively bridge modality gaps and reduce training-inference discrepancies, resulting in more robust and practical multimodal translation.

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) typically enhances text-only translation
by incorporating aligned visual features. Despite the remarkable progress,
state-of-the-art MMT approaches often rely on paired image-text inputs at
inference and are sensitive to irrelevant visual noise, which limits their
robustness and practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose
D2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust
vision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text
and a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which
naturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic
cues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and
reconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich
cross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate
training-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss
that enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.
Extensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves
superior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

*Xuanyu Lin,Xiaona Zeng,Xianwei Zheng,Xutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointLAMA is a point cloud pretraining framework that combines Mamba's efficient sequence modeling with local attention mechanisms and conditional diffusion to achieve competitive performance on 3D tasks with minimal computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While Mamba shows promise for point cloud modeling with its linear complexity global sequence modeling, it lacks local inductive bias needed to capture fine-grained geometric structures in 3D data, limiting its effectiveness for point cloud understanding tasks.

Method: The framework consists of three key components: (1) task-aware point cloud serialization using Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert curves and axis-wise sorting for different tasks, (2) a hybrid encoder combining lightweight Latent Attention blocks with Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA) and Mamba blocks for enhanced local-global modeling, and (3) a conditional diffusion mechanism for representation learning through feature sequence denoising during pretraining.

Result: PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmark datasets while maintaining minimal parameter count and FLOPs, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining local attention with Mamba's global modeling capabilities for efficient point cloud processing.

Conclusion: The proposed PointLAMA framework successfully addresses Mamba's limitation in local geometric modeling by integrating task-aware serialization, hybrid attention-Mamba architecture, and conditional diffusion pretraining, resulting in an efficient and effective solution for point cloud understanding tasks.

Abstract: Mamba has recently gained widespread attention as a backbone model for point
cloud modeling, leveraging a state-space architecture that enables efficient
global sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, its lack of local
inductive bias limits its capacity to capture fine-grained geometric structures
in 3D data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{PointLAMA}, a point
cloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,
a hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a
conditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,
the task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert
space-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens
for classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent
Attention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)
module, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by
leveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This
enables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To
further enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion
mechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences
without relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results
demonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple
benchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its
effectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.

Motivation: Traditional assembly monitoring methods rely on multiple sensor types or complex hardware setups that are cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial environments. There's a need for effective monitoring solutions that use only visual sensors while maintaining high accuracy.

Method: The study develops a novel approach that leverages multiple machine learning models integrated with state information from identical timestamps to detect and confirm assembly process stages using a minimal number of visual sensors.

Result: The method achieves an average accuracy exceeding 92% in detecting assembly process stages. It surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection and visualization capabilities, providing real-time actionable guidance to operators.

Conclusion: The approach improves accuracy and efficiency of assembly monitoring while reducing dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications in Industry 4.0 contexts.

Abstract: In the context of Industry 4.0, effective monitoring of multiple targets and
states during assembly processes is crucial, particularly when constrained to
using only visual sensors. Traditional methods often rely on either multiple
sensor types or complex hardware setups to achieve high accuracy in monitoring,
which can be cost-prohibitive and difficult to implement in dynamic industrial
environments. This study presents a novel approach that leverages multiple
machine learning models to achieve precise monitoring under the limitation of
using a minimal number of visual sensors. By integrating state information from
identical timestamps, our method detects and confirms the current stage of the
assembly process with an average accuracy exceeding 92%. Furthermore, our
approach surpasses conventional methods by offering enhanced error detection
and visuali-zation capabilities, providing real-time, actionable guidance to
operators. This not only improves the accuracy and efficiency of assembly
monitoring but also re-duces dependency on expensive hardware solutions, making
it a more practical choice for modern industrial applications.

### [77] [CasP: Improving Semi-Dense Feature Matching Pipeline Leveraging Cascaded Correspondence Priors for Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17312)
*Peiqi Chen,Lei Yu,Yi Wan,Yingying Pei,Xinyi Liu,Yongxiang Yao,Yingying Zhang,Lixiang Ru,Liheng Zhong,Jingdong Chen,Ming Yang,Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasP introduces a cascaded correspondence pipeline for semi-dense feature matching that decomposes matching into two progressive phases with region-based selective cross-attention, achieving ~2.2× speedup over ELoFTR while maintaining superior accuracy and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semi-dense feature matching methods rely on global search across entire feature maps to establish coarse matches, which limits improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, creating a need for a more targeted and efficient matching approach.

Method: The paper proposes CasP, a cascaded correspondence pipeline that: (1) decomposes matching into two progressive phases, (2) uses region-based selective cross-attention to enhance feature discriminability, (3) restricts search range in the second phase to one-to-many prior areas from the first phase, and (4) incorporates high-level features to reduce computational costs.

Result: CasP achieves ~2.2× speedup compared to ELoFTR at 1152 resolution, with acceleration gains increasing at higher resolutions. The method demonstrates superior performance in geometric estimation and impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities across extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CasP successfully addresses the limitations of existing semi-dense feature matching by providing a more efficient and accurate pipeline through cascaded correspondence priors, making it particularly suitable for latency-sensitive and high-robustness applications like SLAM and UAV systems.

Abstract: Semi-dense feature matching methods have shown strong performance in
challenging scenarios. However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search
across the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further
improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Motivated by this limitation, we
propose a novel pipeline, CasP, which leverages cascaded correspondence priors
for guidance. Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two
progressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention
mechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,
one-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the
one-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this
pipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce
the computational costs of low-level feature extraction. The acceleration gains
of CasP increase with higher resolution, and our lite model achieves a speedup
of $\sim2.2\times$ at a resolution of 1152 compared to the most efficient
method, ELoFTR. Furthermore, extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority
in geometric estimation, particularly with impressive cross-domain
generalization. These advantages highlight its potential for latency-sensitive
and high-robustness applications, such as SLAM and UAV systems. Code is

*Chao He,Jianqiang Ren,Jianjing Xiang,Xiejie Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CartoonAlive is a method that generates high-quality Live2D digital humans from a single portrait image in under 30 seconds, using facial blendshapes and keypoint detection to create expressive 2D cartoon-style avatars that are more efficient than 3D models and more flexible than video-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital human approaches focus mainly on 3D models (which require complex modeling and high rendering costs) or 2D video-based representations (which lack flexibility and real-time interactivity). Interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans using Live2D models have received less attention despite offering a more efficient and expressive alternative that can simulate 3D-like motion without traditional 3D modeling.

Method: CartoonAlive leverages the shape basis concept from 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes suitable for Live2D. The method detects facial keypoints from the input portrait image and infers corresponding blendshape weights based on these keypoints. This enables rapid generation of Live2D models through layered segmentation and dynamic real-time manipulation.

Result: The method can rapidly generate highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D models that closely resemble the input portrait within less than half a minute. The generated models enable synchronized facial expressions, body movements, and intelligent dialogues driven by natural language.

Conclusion: CartoonAlive provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual character animation. The approach offers an efficient alternative to traditional 3D modeling while maintaining expressiveness and real-time interactivity.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,
and real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of
achieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in
intelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast
creation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to
digital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,
interactive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less
attention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high
rendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and
real-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient
and expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered
segmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables
dynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present
CartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital
humans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape
basis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes
suitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based
on facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the
rapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that
closely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work
provides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon
characters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual

### [79] [PARTE: Part-Guided Texturing for 3D Human Reconstruction from a Single Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17332)
*Hyeongjin Nam,Donghwan Kim,Gyeongsik Moon,Kyoung Mu Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PARTE is a 3D human reconstruction method that uses human part segmentation to guide texture reconstruction, addressing the common problem of misaligned textures across different body parts (like jackets and pants) in single-image 3D human reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D human reconstruction methods suffer from misaligned human textures across different body parts, where distinct textures of parts like jackets or pants blend into each other. Most methods don't explicitly use part segmentation information, despite structural coherence of human parts being crucial for inferring textures in invisible regions from single images.

Method: The framework consists of two core components: (1) PartSegmenter - a 3D part segmentation module that reconstructs a textureless human surface from a single image and predicts human part labels, and (2) PartTexturer - a part-guided texturing module that incorporates part information into texture reconstruction using prior knowledge from a pre-trained image generation network for texture alignment of human parts.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that PARTE achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction, with improved texture alignment across different human parts compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: By explicitly incorporating 3D human part segmentation information as guidance, PARTE successfully addresses the texture misalignment problem in 3D human reconstruction, achieving superior reconstruction quality compared to existing approaches that don't utilize part segmentation priors.

Abstract: The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main
limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such
as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into
others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to
infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most
existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part
segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.
In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a
key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core
components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we
propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially
reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based
on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into
texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module
(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image
generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human
reconstruction. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework for detecting weak moving targets in low-altitude surveillance systems without manual annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance at over 1000 FPS through temporal signal modeling and trajectory mining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detecting weak moving targets in low-altitude surveillance systems is challenging due to low signal energy, small spatial extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with extracting robust features and lack reliable annotations for training.

Method: The paper proposes a Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS) framework that reformulates detection as pixel-wise temporal signal modeling. It includes: (1) Temporal Signal Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) with encoder-decoder architecture, (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention) module for enhanced temporal pattern sensitivity, and (3) graph-based trajectory mining strategy for false alarm suppression and temporal consistency.

Result: The framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a purpose-built low-SNR dataset while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance and operates at over 1000 FPS, making it suitable for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: The TPS framework successfully addresses the challenge of weak target detection in surveillance systems by eliminating the need for manual annotations while maintaining high performance and real-time processing capabilities, demonstrating its practical value for deployment scenarios.

Abstract: In low-altitude surveillance and early warning systems, detecting weak moving
targets remains a significant challenge due to low signal energy, small spatial
extent, and complex background clutter. Existing methods struggle with
extracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)
framework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any
manual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework
reformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where
weak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal
Reconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to
reconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder
architecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)
module to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a
graph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and
ensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods
while requiring no human annotations. It achieves strong detection performance
and operates at over 1000 FPS, underscoring its potential for real-time
deployment in practical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeMo++ is a motion forecasting and planning framework that decouples motion estimation into holistic motion intentions and fine spatiotemporal states, using a hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple autonomous driving benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-query-one-trajectory methods for motion forecasting and planning can produce diverse motion intentions but struggle to model intricate spatiotemporal evolution of trajectories, leading to potential collisions or suboptimal outcomes in autonomous driving systems.

Method: The paper proposes DeMo++, which decouples motion estimation into two components: (1) holistic motion intentions to capture diverse movement directions, and (2) fine spatiotemporal states to track dynamic progress and enable self-refinement. It introduces a cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism and implements the framework using a hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture for efficient information aggregation and trajectory modeling.

Result: DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks including motion forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and end-to-end planning (NAVSIM), demonstrating comprehensive modeling of both motion diversity and spatiotemporal evolution.

Conclusion: The decoupled approach of separating motion intentions from spatiotemporal states, combined with cross-scene interaction and hybrid Attention-Mamba architecture, effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods and achieves superior performance in autonomous driving motion tasks.

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories
of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and
efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments.
State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm,
where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode
trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it
often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of
trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome
this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion
estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture
the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to
track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a
self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory
interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent
scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of
motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To
effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining
Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both
mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory
state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion
forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and
end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes PMRL, a novel multimodal representation learning framework that aligns multiple modalities simultaneously without relying on anchor modalities by optimizing the dominant singular value of representation matrices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multimodal representation learning methods rely on pairwise contrastive learning with predefined anchor modalities, which restricts alignment across all modalities. Existing approaches for simultaneous multimodal alignment face challenges including limitations from fixed anchor points and instability from optimizing products of singular values.

Method: PMRL leverages the theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix and optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to align modalities along a shared leading direction. The method uses a softmax-based loss function treating singular values as logits to prioritize the largest singular value, combined with instance-wise contrastive regularization on leading eigenvectors to maintain inter-instance separability.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods in multimodal representation learning performance.

Conclusion: PMRL successfully addresses the limitations of existing multimodal representation learning approaches by providing a more stable framework for simultaneous multimodal alignment without anchor dependency, achieving better performance across various tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation
space by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal
understanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive
learning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment
across all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous
alignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as
limitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from
optimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this
paper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel
framework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without
anchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the
theoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,
PMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to
align modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based
loss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest
singular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the
leading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents
representation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate
PMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be
publicly available.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning approach to reduce the expensive pixel-level annotation requirements for training semantically-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), achieving over 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training semantically-aware NeRFs requires pixel-level class labels which are prohibitively expensive to collect, creating a significant annotation burden that limits practical applications.

Method: The authors investigate various active learning design choices including selection granularity and strategies, and propose a novel active learning strategy that incorporates 3D geometric constraints in the sample selection process for semantically-aware NeRF training.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed active learning approach effectively reduces annotation costs, achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random sampling while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Active learning is a viable solution for reducing the annotation burden in semantically-aware NeRF training, with the proposed 3D geometry-aware selection strategy significantly outperforming random sampling approaches.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) models are implicit neural scene representation
methods that offer unprecedented capabilities in novel view synthesis.
Semantically-aware NeRFs not only capture the shape and radiance of a scene,
but also encode semantic information of the scene. The training of
semantically-aware NeRFs typically requires pixel-level class labels, which can
be prohibitively expensive to collect. In this work, we explore active learning
as a potential solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We investigate
various design choices for active learning of semantically-aware NeRF,
including selection granularity and selection strategies. We further propose a
novel active learning strategy that takes into account 3D geometric constraints
in sample selection. Our experiments demonstrate that active learning can
effectively reduce the annotation cost of training semantically-aware NeRF,
achieving more than 2X reduction in annotation cost compared to random
sampling.

*Lile Cai,Ramanpreet Singh Pahwa,Xun Xu,Jie Wang,Richard Chang,Lining Zhang,Chuan-Sheng Foo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes an active learning approach for semiconductor X-Ray microscopy defect detection that addresses domain shift and class imbalance through contrastive pretraining and rareness-aware sample selection, reducing annotation requirements while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for semiconductor XRM defect identification require large amounts of annotated data for training, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain, especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic segmentation. The paper aims to reduce this annotation burden using active learning.

Method: The authors propose an active learning framework with two key components: (1) contrastive pretraining on unlabelled data to obtain initialization weights for each AL cycle, addressing large domain shift issues, and (2) a rareness-aware acquisition function that prioritizes selecting samples containing rare classes to handle severe class imbalance problems.

Result: The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a semiconductor dataset compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory structures containing logic and memory dies, demonstrating effective reduction of annotation requirements while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: Active learning with contrastive pretraining and rareness-aware sample selection successfully addresses the unique challenges of applying AL to semiconductor XRM analysis, providing an effective solution to reduce annotation costs while achieving competitive performance in defect identification tasks.

Abstract: The development of X-Ray microscopy (XRM) technology has enabled
non-destructive inspection of semiconductor structures for defect
identification. Deep learning is widely used as the state-of-the-art approach
to perform visual analysis tasks. However, deep learning based models require
large amount of annotated data to train. This can be time-consuming and
expensive to obtain especially for dense prediction tasks like semantic
segmentation. In this work, we explore active learning (AL) as a potential
solution to alleviate the annotation burden. We identify two unique challenges
when applying AL on semiconductor XRM scans: large domain shift and severe
class-imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose to perform contrastive
pretraining on the unlabelled data to obtain the initialization weights for
each AL cycle, and a rareness-aware acquisition function that favors the
selection of samples containing rare classes. We evaluate our method on a
semiconductor dataset that is compiled from XRM scans of high bandwidth memory
structures composed of logic and memory dies, and demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### [86] [Exploring Spatial Diversity for Region-based Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17367)
*Lile Cai,Xun Xu,Lining Zhang,Chuan-Sheng Foo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a region-based active learning framework for semantic segmentation that incorporates spatial diversity alongside uncertainty to reduce annotation costs, achieving 95% performance of fully supervised methods with only 5-9% labeled pixels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale labeled datasets for semantic segmentation require expensive pixel-level annotations. The paper aims to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance by strategically selecting informative image regions for labeling instead of entire images.

Method: The authors propose a unified optimization framework that combines spatial diversity with traditional active selection criteria (uncertainty and feature diversity) for region-based active learning. The method enforces local spatial diversity when selecting batches of informative image regions for annotation.

Result: The framework was evaluated on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC datasets, achieving 95% performance of fully supervised methods using only 5-9% of labeled pixels. It outperformed all existing state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Incorporating spatial diversity into region-based active learning significantly improves performance over uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based methods alone. The proposed framework demonstrates substantial annotation cost reduction while maintaining competitive segmentation performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation are based on deep neural
networks trained on large-scale labeled datasets. Acquiring such datasets would
incur large annotation costs, especially for dense pixel-level prediction tasks
like semantic segmentation. We consider region-based active learning as a
strategy to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. In this
setting, batches of informative image regions instead of entire images are
selected for labeling. Importantly, we propose that enforcing local spatial
diversity is beneficial for active learning in this case, and to incorporate
spatial diversity along with the traditional active selection criterion, e.g.,
data sample uncertainty, in a unified optimization framework for region-based
active learning. We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively
improves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based
active learning methods. Our framework achieves $95\%$ performance of fully
supervised methods with only $5-9\%$ of the labeled pixels, outperforming all
state-of-the-art region-based active learning methods for semantic
segmentation.

*Keon-Hee Park,Seun-An Choe,Gyeong-Moon Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD) to adapt object detectors to new domains without source data while also detecting unknown objects, using a novel CollaPAUL framework that combines collaborative tuning and principal axis-based unknown labeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing source-free object detection methods operate under the restrictive closed-set assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain, preventing detection of undefined objects. This limits practical applications where new, unknown objects may appear in the target domain.

Method: The paper introduces CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling) framework consisting of two main components: (1) Collaborative tuning that integrates target-dependent knowledge from an auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector using cross-domain attention mechanism, and (2) Principal axes-based unknown labeling that assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness through principal axes projection and confidence scores.

Result: CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performance on SFUOD benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in both recognizing known objects and detecting unknown objects in the target domain without access to source data.

Conclusion: The proposed SFUOD scenario and CollaPAUL framework successfully address the limitation of closed-set assumptions in source-free domain adaptation, enabling practical object detection that can handle both known and unknown objects in target domains without requiring source data access.

Abstract: Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain
to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.
While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source
dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption
that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target
domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined
objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object
Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only
recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.
To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal
Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning
enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from
the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained
detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal
axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by
estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from
model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art
performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

### [88] [A Conditional Probability Framework for Compositional Zero-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17377)
*Peng Wu,Qiuxia Lai,Hao Fang,Guo-Sen Xie,Yilong Yin,Xiankai Lu,Wenguan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning that models attribute-object dependencies instead of treating them independently, using conditional probability decomposition and cross-attention mechanisms to better recognize unseen attribute-object combinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CZSL approaches treat attributes and objects as independent entities, overlooking semantic constraints and contextual dependencies within compositions. For instance, certain attributes naturally pair with specific objects, and the same attribute can manifest differently in different contexts, making attribute-object interdependence a fundamental yet long-ignored challenge in CZSL.

Method: The authors adopt a Conditional Probability Framework (CPF) that decomposes composition probability into object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood. They incorporate textual descriptors to enhance object feature learning by highlighting semantically relevant image regions, then use cross-attention mechanisms to guide attribute learning through enhanced object features for better contextual alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over traditional methods that treat attributes and objects independently.

Conclusion: By jointly optimizing object likelihood and conditional attribute likelihood, the method effectively captures compositional dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions, addressing the fundamental challenge of attribute-object interdependence in CZSL.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen combinations
of known objects and attributes by leveraging knowledge from previously seen
compositions. Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling
attributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.
However, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual
dependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally
pair with specific objects (e.g., "striped" applies to "zebra" or "shirts" but
not "sky" or "water"), while the same attribute can manifest differently
depending on context (e.g., "young" in "young tree" vs. "young dog"). Thus,
capturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet
long-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional
Probability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.
We decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the
likelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To
enhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to
highlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features
then guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring
better contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and
conditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional
dependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions. Extensive experiments
on multiple CZSL benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EndoGen is the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework that uses autoregressive modeling with Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) and Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) to generate high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic videos for medical imaging applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior endoscopic video generation efforts have limitations: they either focus on static images lacking dynamic context needed for practical applications, or rely on unconditional generation that fails to provide meaningful clinical references. There's a need for conditional video generation that can provide contextually relevant endoscopic content for medical diagnostics.

Method: The paper proposes EndoGen, an autoregressive model with two key components: (1) Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy that reformulates multi-frame generation as grid-based image generation to leverage global dependency modeling of autoregressive architectures, and (2) Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism that selectively focuses on semantically meaningful regions during generation to enhance content richness and diversity.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content. The generated videos also improve performance on downstream polyp segmentation tasks, showing practical clinical utility.

Conclusion: EndoGen successfully addresses the limitations of previous approaches by providing the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework that produces clinically meaningful, high-quality dynamic content, with demonstrated benefits for downstream medical imaging tasks like polyp segmentation.

Abstract: Endoscopic video generation is crucial for advancing medical imaging and
enhancing diagnostic capabilities. However, prior efforts in this field have
either focused on static images, lacking the dynamic context required for
practical applications, or have relied on unconditional generation that fails
to provide meaningful references for clinicians. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose the first conditional endoscopic video generation framework, namely
EndoGen. Specifically, we build an autoregressive model with a tailored
Spatiotemporal Grid-Frame Patterning (SGP) strategy. It reformulates the
learning of generating multiple frames as a grid-based image generation
pattern, which effectively capitalizes the inherent global dependency modeling
capabilities of autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we propose a
Semantic-Aware Token Masking (SAT) mechanism, which enhances the model's
ability to produce rich and diverse content by selectively focusing on
semantically meaningful regions during the generation process. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating high-quality, conditionally guided endoscopic content, and improves
the performance of downstream task of polyp segmentation. Code released at

*Zhaolin Cai,Fan Li,Ziwei Zheng,Yanjun Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiProbe-VAD is a novel training-free framework that leverages pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for video anomaly detection by extracting informative hidden states from intermediate layers, achieving superior performance without requiring fine-tuning or extensive labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Video Anomaly Detection methods face significant limitations including substantial computational demands and heavy reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which restricts their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: The paper proposes HiProbe-VAD with a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP) mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative hidden states from optimal intermediate layers of MLLMs during reasoning, followed by a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module for detection and explanation generation.

Result: HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free methods and most traditional approaches on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets, while demonstrating remarkable cross-model generalization capabilities across different MLLMs without any tuning requirements.

Conclusion: The framework successfully unlocks the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection by discovering that intermediate hidden states contain more information-rich representations with higher sensitivity and linear separability for anomalies compared to output layers, paving the way for more practical and scalable VAD solutions.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes HLFormer, the first hyperbolic modeling framework for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) that uses hyperbolic space learning to better capture hierarchical video semantics and improve cross-modal matching between untrimmed videos and partial text queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PRVR methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and overlooks hierarchical semantics, leading to suboptimal temporal modeling when matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.

Method: The paper introduces HLFormer, which integrates Lorentz Attention Block and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces, uses Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module for dynamic feature fusion, and employs Partial Order Preservation Loss with Lorentzian cone constraints to enforce "text < video" hierarchy.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HLFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in partially relevant video retrieval tasks, showing improved cross-modal matching performance between video content and text queries.

Conclusion: HLFormer successfully addresses the limitations of Euclidean space modeling in PRVR by leveraging hyperbolic space learning to better capture hierarchical video semantics, resulting in superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) addresses the critical challenge of
matching untrimmed videos with text queries describing only partial content.
Existing methods suffer from geometric distortion in Euclidean space that
sometimes misrepresents the intrinsic hierarchical structure of videos and
overlooks certain hierarchical semantics, ultimately leading to suboptimal
temporal modeling. To address this issue, we propose the first hyperbolic
modeling framework for PRVR, namely HLFormer, which leverages hyperbolic space
learning to compensate for the suboptimal hierarchical modeling capabilities of
Euclidean space. Specifically, HLFormer integrates the Lorentz Attention Block
and Euclidean Attention Block to encode video embeddings in hybrid spaces,
using the Mean-Guided Adaptive Interaction Module to dynamically fuse features.
Additionally, we introduce a Partial Order Preservation Loss to enforce "text <
video" hierarchy through Lorentzian cone constraints. This approach further
enhances cross-modal matching by reinforcing partial relevance between video
content and text queries. Extensive experiments show that HLFormer outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Code is released at

*Ayce Idil Aytekin,Chuqiao Li,Diogo Luvizon,Rishabh Dabral,Martin Oswald,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces MoviCam, the first real-world dataset with ground-truth camera trajectories and 3D human motion, and proposes PhysDynPose, a physics-based method for accurate human pose tracking with moving cameras and non-flat scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing monocular human pose tracking methods suffer from artifacts when dealing with non-flat ground planes or moving cameras, and are typically evaluated on synthetic datasets or real videos without ground truth, which fail to model real-world complexities like light transport and camera motion.

Method: PhysDynPose combines a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator for human pose estimation with a robust SLAM method for dynamic camera trajectory capture, enabling human pose recovery in world frame. The method then refines kinematic estimates using a scene-aware physics optimizer that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints.

Result: The new MoviCam benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art methods struggle with moving cameras and non-planar environments, while PhysDynPose robustly estimates both human and camera poses in world coordinates under these challenging conditions.

Conclusion: The paper successfully addresses limitations of existing human pose tracking methods by providing a comprehensive real-world dataset and developing a physics-based approach that handles camera motion and complex scene geometry more effectively than current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Most monocular and physics-based human pose tracking methods, while achieving
state-of-the-art results, suffer from artifacts when the scene does not have a
strictly flat ground plane or when the camera is moving. Moreover, these
methods are often evaluated on in-the-wild real world videos without
ground-truth data or on synthetic datasets, which fail to model the real world
light transport, camera motion, and pose-induced appearance and geometry
changes. To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first
non-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a
dynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion
with human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a
physics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints
for more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat
scenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to
obtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera
trajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame. We then
refine the kinematic pose estimate using our scene-aware physics optimizer.
From our new benchmark, we found that even state-of-the-art methods struggle
with this inherently challenging setting, i.e. a moving camera and non-planar
environments, while our method robustly estimates both human and camera poses
in world coordinates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study introduces C-MIR, a novel content-based image retrieval system for 3D medical images that eliminates the need for pre-segmented data and demonstrates improved performance in tumor detection and staging across multiple tumor sites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The increasing volume of medical images creates challenges for radiologists in retrieving relevant cases. Existing CBIR systems lack standardized evaluation and comprehensive studies, and current approaches rely on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, which doesn't align with real clinical practice using large unstructured image archiving systems like PACS.

Method: The authors developed C-MIR, a volumetric re-ranking method that adapts ColBERT's contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging. They created a framework that eliminates reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, making it compatible with clinical PACS systems. The method was evaluated across four tumor sites using three feature extractors and three database configurations.

Result: C-MIR demonstrated significant advantages in volumetric medical image retrieval. The system successfully adapted the late interaction principle to 3D medical images, enabling effective context-aware re-ranking. It showed improved performance in tumor flagging, particularly for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05), and demonstrated potential for improving tumor staging. The method effectively localized regions of interest without requiring pre-segmentation.

Conclusion: C-MIR offers a computationally efficient alternative to systems requiring expensive data enrichment steps and successfully bridges the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and practical healthcare applications. The work paves the way for improved diagnostic processes by providing a practical CBIR solution that aligns with real clinical workflows.

Abstract: The increasing volume of medical images poses challenges for radiologists in
retrieving relevant cases. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems offer
potential for efficient access to similar cases, yet lack standardized
evaluation and comprehensive studies. Building on prior studies for tumor
characterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric
medical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating
reliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large

introduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's
contextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)
comprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors
and three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant
advantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late
interaction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective
context-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively
localize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of
datasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems
relying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising
improvements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly
for colon and lung tumors (p<0.05). C-MIR also shows potential for improving
tumor staging, warranting further exploration of its capabilities. Ultimately,
our work seeks to bridge the gap between advanced retrieval techniques and
their practical applications in healthcare, paving the way for improved

TL;DR: CAPRI-CT is a causal-aware deep learning framework that integrates CT images with acquisition metadata to optimize image quality while minimizing radiation exposure through predictive modeling and counterfactual inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving high image quality while minimizing radiation exposure in computed tomography (CT) remains a key clinical challenge that needs to be addressed to improve patient safety and imaging efficiency.

Method: The framework uses an ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to extract features and generate causal representations from CT images and acquisition metadata (tube voltage, tube current, contrast agent types). These features are fused to predict Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and enable counterfactual inference for what-if simulations.

Result: CAPRI-CT achieved strong predictive performance using ensemble learning approach and successfully enables both prediction and interpretability for CT imaging optimization.

Conclusion: CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans, offering a practical solution for optimizing CT imaging quality while reducing radiation exposure.

Abstract: In computed tomography (CT), achieving high image quality while minimizing
radiation exposure remains a key clinical challenge. This paper presents
CAPRI-CT, a novel causal-aware deep learning framework for Causal Analysis and
Predictive Reasoning for Image Quality Optimization in CT imaging. CAPRI-CT
integrates image data with acquisition metadata (such as tube voltage, tube
current, and contrast agent types) to model the underlying causal relationships
that influence image quality. An ensemble of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is
employed to extract meaningful features and generate causal representations
from observational data, including CT images and associated imaging parameters.
These input features are fused to predict the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and
support counterfactual inference, enabling what-if simulations, such as changes
in contrast agents (types and concentrations) or scan parameters. CAPRI-CT is
trained and validated using an ensemble learning approach, achieving strong
predictive performance. By facilitating both prediction and interpretability,
CAPRI-CT provides actionable insights that could help radiologists and
technicians design more efficient CT protocols without repeated physical scans.

*Yehao Lu,Minghe Weng,Zekang Xiao,Rui Jiang,Wei Su,Guangcong Zheng,Ping Lu,Xi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Dynamic-DINO, which applies Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to real-time open-vocabulary object detection by extending Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, achieving better performance with less training data through dynamic expert collaboration patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While MoE architecture has shown success in Large Vision-Language Models, its potential in real-time open-vocabulary object detectors remains unexplored. The authors aim to investigate how MoE can benefit smaller models that also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets for object detection tasks.

Method: The paper proposes Dynamic-DINO using: (1) MoE-Tuning strategy to convert Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge from dense to dynamic inference, (2) granularity decomposition mechanism to break FFN into multiple smaller expert networks, (3) pre-trained weight allocation strategy for experts with specific router initialization, and (4) input-relevant expert activation during inference to form compact subnets.

Result: Dynamic-DINO outperforms Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge despite being pretrained with only 1.56M open-source data compared to the baseline's private Grounding20M dataset. The method reveals that experts cooperate diversely in shallow layers but form fixed collaborative structures (2-3 partners) in deeper layers for specialized pattern processing.

Conclusion: MoE architecture can be successfully applied to real-time open-vocabulary object detection, offering superior performance with reduced training data requirements. The dynamic expert collaboration patterns provide insights into how different network depths utilize expert knowledge, making it a promising approach for efficient vision-language models.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has excelled in Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), yet its potential in real-time open-vocabulary
object detectors, which also leverage large-scale vision-language datasets but
smaller models, remains unexplored. This work investigates this domain,
revealing intriguing insights. In the shallow layers, experts tend to cooperate
with diverse peers to expand the search space. While in the deeper layers,
fixed collaborative structures emerge, where each expert maintains 2-3 fixed
partners and distinct expert combinations are specialized in processing
specific patterns. Concretely, we propose Dynamic-DINO, which extends Grounding
DINO 1.5 Edge from a dense model to a dynamic inference framework via an
efficient MoE-Tuning strategy. Additionally, we design a granularity
decomposition mechanism to decompose the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of base
model into multiple smaller expert networks, expanding the subnet search space.
To prevent performance degradation at the start of fine-tuning, we further
propose a pre-trained weight allocation strategy for the experts, coupled with
a specific router initialization. During inference, only the input-relevant
experts are activated to form a compact subnet. Experiments show that,
pretrained with merely 1.56M open-source data, Dynamic-DINO outperforms
Grounding DINO 1.5 Edge, pretrained on the private Grounding20M dataset.

*Sania Waheed,Na Min An,Michael Milford,Sarvapali D. Ramchurn,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid geo-localization framework that combines vision-language models (VLMs) with visual place recognition (VPR) methods to achieve more accurate and scalable planet-scale image geo-localization by using VLMs to generate geographic priors that guide retrieval search space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional geo-localization methods face significant challenges: retrieval-based methods struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive training data. Although VLMs show promise with contextual understanding, they suffer from hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone solutions for the challenging task of planet-scale geo-localization.

Method: The proposed hybrid framework works in three stages: (1) leverages a VLM to generate geographic priors that effectively guide and constrain the retrieval search space, (2) employs a retrieval step using visual place recognition methods, and (3) implements a re-ranking mechanism that selects the most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity to the initially estimated coordinates.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple geo-localization benchmarks, achieving improvements of up to 4.51% at street level and up to 13.52% at city level. The results demonstrate that combining VLM-generated geographic priors with VPR leads to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization systems.

Conclusion: The hybrid approach successfully addresses the limitations of individual methods by combining VLM contextual understanding with VPR reliability. The VLM-generated geographic priors effectively guide the retrieval process, resulting in a more scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization system that outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across different geographical scales.

Abstract: Geo-localization from a single image at planet scale (essentially an advanced
or extreme version of the kidnapped robot problem) is a fundamental and
challenging task in applications such as navigation, autonomous driving and
disaster response due to the vast diversity of locations, environmental
conditions, and scene variations. Traditional retrieval-based methods for
geo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while
classification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive
training data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a
promising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.
However, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to
hallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone
solutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework
that combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place
recognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a
prior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then
employ a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the
most geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity
to the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple
geo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level
(up to 13.52%). Our results demonstrate that VLM-generated geographic priors in
combination with VPR lead to scalable, robust, and accurate geo-localization
systems.

*Francesco Tonini,Lorenzo Vaquero,Alessandro Conti,Cigdem Beyan,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free HOI detection framework called DYSCO that leverages Vision-Language Models to detect human-object interactions without requiring manual annotations, using multimodal representations and attention mechanisms to achieve competitive performance especially on rare interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI detection methods require large manually annotated datasets which are labor-intensive, inconsistent, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. Vision-Language Models offer untapped potential for enhancing interaction representation that can address these limitations.

Method: DYSCO framework uses a multimodal registry combining textual and visual interaction representations, incorporates visual cues with innovative interaction signatures for semantic alignment of verbs, and employs a multi-head attention mechanism to adaptively weight visual and textual feature contributions.

Result: DYSCO surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and achieves competitive performance with training-based approaches, with particular excellence in detecting rare interactions.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free DYSCO framework successfully addresses scalability issues in HOI detection by effectively utilizing Vision-Language Models, demonstrating that robust interaction understanding can be achieved without manual annotations while excelling at rare interaction detection.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to identify humans and objects
within images and interpret their interactions. Existing HOI methods rely
heavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from
visual cues. These annotations are labor-intensive to create, prone to
inconsistency, and limit scalability to new domains and rare interactions. We
argue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped
potential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior
work has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there
remain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection
framework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively
utilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal
registry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry
incorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction
signatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective
generalization to rare interactions. Additionally, we propose a unique
multi-head attention mechanism that adaptively weights the contributions of the
visual and textual features. Experimental results demonstrate that our DYSCO
surpasses training-free state-of-the-art models and is competitive with
training-based approaches, particularly excelling in rare interactions. Code is

### [98] [ERMV: Editing 4D Robotic Multi-view images to enhance embodied agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17462)
*Chang Nie,Guangming Wang,Zhe Lie,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMV is a novel data augmentation framework that efficiently edits 4D multi-view sequential images for robot imitation learning, addressing data scarcity issues in Vision-Language-Action models through innovative attention mechanisms and sparse sampling techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robot imitation learning faces severe constraints due to high data collection costs and scarcity of high-quality 4D multi-view sequential image data, which limits the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies like Vision-Language-Action models. Current data augmentation methods lack effective approaches for editing 4D multi-view sequential images for manipulation tasks.

Method: ERMV introduces three key innovations: (1) Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism to maintain spatio-temporal consistency by learning pixel shifts before applying geometric constraints; (2) Sparse Spatio-Temporal (STT) module that decouples temporal and spatial views and uses sparse sampling to reduce computational costs while maximizing editing window; (3) Feedback intervention mechanism using Multimodal Large Language Models to check editing inconsistencies and request expert guidance when needed.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization performance of Vision-Language-Action models in both simulated and real-world environments, effectively addressing the three core challenges of maintaining consistency, expanding working windows, and preserving semantic integrity.

Conclusion: ERMV successfully addresses the data scarcity problem in robot imitation learning by providing an efficient framework for editing 4D multi-view sequential images, enabling better generalization of embodied intelligence policies through innovative attention mechanisms and computational optimization strategies.

Abstract: Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,
the high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely
constrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies
like Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful
strategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view
sequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we
propose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation
framework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on
single-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core
challenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic
views and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low
computational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical
objects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of
innovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we
introduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that
learns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.
Second, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse
Spatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views
and remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the
views to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,
we incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted
expert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of
VLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.

*Elena Pitta,Tom Kouwenhoven,Tessa Verhoef*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study evaluates Visual Entailment (VE) as a probe for vision-language understanding using LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model, finding that while fine-tuning achieves strong performance (83.3% accuracy), the model shows concerning tendencies to hallucinate without visual input and may over-rely on linguistic priors, questioning VE's effectiveness as a multimodal evaluation task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether Visual Entailment (VE) serves as a reliable probe for assessing vision-language understanding in multimodal language models, and to understand the underlying possibilities and limitations of this evaluation task beyond just reporting performance metrics.

Method: Conducted experiments with LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. Explored various factors including prompt design, number and order of in-context examples, and access to visual information. Used explanation-based evaluations to probe the model's reasoning processes and compared results with limited vision conditions.

Result: Three-shot inference outperformed zero-shot baselines, but additional examples added noise. Label order in prompts critically influenced predictions. Without visual information, the model heavily hallucinated content. Fine-tuning achieved 83.3% accuracy on e-SNLI-VE dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art OFA-X model. Fine-tuned model provided semantically meaningful explanations with 89.2% BERTScore F1-score, similar to human explanations.

Conclusion: The study reveals both utility and limitations of VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding. While fine-tuning shows strong performance, the model's tendency to hallucinate without visual input and comparable BERTScore results in limited vision experiments question the visual grounding of this task. The findings highlight the need for refining multimodal evaluation methods to better assess true vision-language understanding.

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which the Visual Entailment (VE) task
serves as a reliable probe of vision-language understanding in multimodal
language models, using the LLaMA 3.2 11B Vision model as a test case. Beyond
reporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal
about the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a
series of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,
exploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context
examples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To
further probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based
evaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the
zero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than
they provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a
critical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual
information, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine
content, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic
priors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on
the e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.
Additionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model
provides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with
a BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore
results in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of
this task. Overall, our results highlight both the utility and limitations of
VE as a diagnostic task for vision-language understanding and point to
directions for refining multimodal evaluation methods.

*Chuang Chen,Xiaolin Qin,Jing Hu,Wenyi Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRMambaV2 is a novel sparse point cloud upsampling method for autonomous driving that uses biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention and dual-branch architecture to improve reconstruction quality in long-range sparse regions while preserving overall geometric accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving is challenging due to inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures. Existing methods that convert 3D scenes to 2D image super-resolution tasks struggle with sparse and blurry feature representation, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct detailed spatial topologies.

Method: The paper proposes SRMambaV2 with three key components: (1) a biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism inspired by human driver visual perception to model feature distribution in distant sparse areas, (2) a dual-branch network architecture to enhance sparse feature representation, and (3) a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function to refine fine-grained detail reconstruction.

Result: Experimental results show that SRMambaV2 achieves superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating enhanced upsampling accuracy in long-range sparse regions while maintaining overall geometric reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: SRMambaV2 effectively addresses the challenges of sparse point cloud upsampling in automotive scenarios, showing practical value and effectiveness for autonomous driving applications through its biomimetic attention mechanism and dual-branch architecture.

Abstract: Upsampling LiDAR point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios remains a
significant challenge due to the inherent sparsity and complex 3D structures of
the data. Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting
the complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,
due to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately
reconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major
difficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling
method named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range
sparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.
Specifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a
biomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the
feature distribution in distant sparse areas. Meanwhile, we introduce a
dual-branch network architecture to enhance the representation of sparse
features. In addition, we introduce a progressive adaptive loss (PAL) function
to further refine the reconstruction of fine-grained details during the
upsampling process. Experimental results demonstrate that SRMambaV2 achieves
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
highlighting its effectiveness and practical value in automotive sparse point
cloud upsampling tasks.

*Hugues Roy,Reuben Dorent,Ninon Burgos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces AnoBFN, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method based on Bayesian Flow Networks for detecting Alzheimer's disease-related anomalies in brain FDG PET images, outperforming existing VAE, GAN, and diffusion-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised anomaly detection is crucial in neuroimaging for identifying deviations from healthy brain data to facilitate neurological disorder diagnosis. While Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) show promise as generative models, they haven't been applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection tasks yet.

Method: The authors develop AnoBFN, an extension of Bayesian Flow Networks for unsupervised anomaly detection. The method is designed to perform conditional image generation under high spatially correlated noise and preserve subject specificity through recursive feedback from input images during the generative process.

Result: AnoBFN demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods including VAE-based (beta-VAE), GAN-based (f-AnoGAN), and diffusion-based (AnoDDPM) approaches on Alzheimer's disease anomaly detection in FDG PET images, showing effectiveness in detecting anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

Conclusion: The study successfully demonstrates that Bayesian Flow Networks can be effectively adapted for medical imaging anomaly detection. AnoBFN provides a promising new approach for neuroimaging applications, combining the strengths of diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference to achieve better anomaly detection performance in brain imaging.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) plays a crucial role in neuroimaging for
identifying deviations from healthy subject data and thus facilitating the
diagnosis of neurological disorders. In this work, we focus on Bayesian flow
networks (BFNs), a novel class of generative models, which have not yet been
applied to medical imaging or anomaly detection. BFNs combine the strength of
diffusion frameworks and Bayesian inference. We introduce AnoBFN, an extension
of BFNs for UAD, designed to: i) perform conditional image generation under
high levels of spatially correlated noise, and ii) preserve subject specificity
by incorporating a recursive feedback from the input image throughout the
generative process. We evaluate AnoBFN on the challenging task of Alzheimer's
disease-related anomaly detection in FDG PET images. Our approach outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods based on VAEs (beta-VAE), GANs (f-AnoGAN), and
diffusion models (AnoDDPM), demonstrating its effectiveness at detecting
anomalies while reducing false positive rates.

*Minglong Xue,Aoxiang Ning,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Mingliang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel frequency-domain approach (DFDNet) for removing flare artifacts in nighttime photography by decoupling content from flare information in frequency domain, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flare removal methods struggle with large-scale flare artifacts and structural damage repair near light sources in nighttime photography. The authors observed that flare artifacts show more significant discrepancies in frequency domain compared to spatial domain, motivating a frequency-based approach.

Method: DFDNet uses two main components: (1) Global Dynamic Frequency-domain Guidance (GDFG) module that dynamically optimizes global frequency features to separate flare from content information, and (2) Local Detail Guidance Module (LDGM) using contrastive learning to align local light source features with reference images for better detail preservation.

Result: Experimental results show DFDNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in flare removal performance, effectively handling large-scale flare artifacts while preserving fine-grained image details.

Conclusion: The frequency-domain approach successfully addresses limitations of existing spatial-domain methods for flare removal. The dynamic frequency guidance and local detail preservation strategy effectively removes flare artifacts while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in
images, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of
downstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue
to struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural
damage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging
flare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference
images in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this
paper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that
decouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,
effectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists
mainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local
detail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive
the frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing
global frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from
content information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning
strategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference
image, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves
fine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of
performance. The code is available at

TL;DR: This paper presents a comprehensive comparative evaluation of deep learning methods for X-ray object detection in security screening, systematically benchmarking 10 state-of-the-art detection schemes across 6 large-scale datasets to provide insights into performance, efficiency, and computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated X-ray inspection faces significant challenges including object occlusion, variations in physical properties, device diversity, and limited training data. Despite extensive research, experimental evaluations are often incomplete with conflicting outcomes, creating a need for systematic comparison to understand the research landscape and guide future work.

Result: The systematic evaluation revealed critical insights about: overall behavior of object detection schemes, object-level detection performance across different categories, dataset-specific observations showing varying performance patterns, and comprehensive time efficiency and computational complexity analysis. The study provides reproducible results with publicly available code and model weights.

Conclusion: This comprehensive comparative study establishes a standardized evaluation framework for X-ray object detection methods, providing critical insights that can guide researchers in selecting appropriate approaches and identifying areas for improvement in automated security screening systems.

Abstract: Automated X-ray inspection is crucial for efficient and unobtrusive security

to critical observations and insights, emphasizing key aspects such as: a)
Overall behavior of the object detection schemes, b) Object-level detection
performance, c) Dataset-specific observations, and d) Time efficiency and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompactFusion is a compression framework that reduces communication overhead in parallel diffusion model inference by exploiting temporal redundancy in activations, achieving 3.0x speedup on 4xL20 while maintaining high generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models require substantial computational resources and multi-accelerator parallelism for real-time deployment, but parallel inference suffers from significant communication overhead due to exchanging large activations between devices, which limits efficiency and scalability.

Method: CompactFusion uses Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise activation differences) instead of full activations, exploiting the temporal redundancy where adjacent diffusion steps produce highly similar activations. The method also integrates lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation.

Result: On 4xL20 hardware, CompactFusion achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving generation fidelity compared to prior methods. For communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on slow networks, it achieves 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based methods. The framework applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings.

Conclusion: CompactFusion establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference by effectively addressing communication bottlenecks through temporal redundancy exploitation, delivering both lower latency and significantly higher generation quality while being easily integrable without requiring pipeline rework.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial
computational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for
real-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant
communication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,
limiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression
framework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation
quality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong
temporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,
saturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.
To address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that
encodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via
Residual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise
activation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical
justification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling
substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate
lightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion
establishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower
latency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On
4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also
uniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on
slow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.
CompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,
and integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework. Portable
implementation demonstrated on xDiT is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes STQE, a spatial-temporal network that enhances the visual quality of compressed dynamic point clouds by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations, achieving significant improvements in PSNR and BD-rate reductions across color components.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic point clouds, particularly the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored, creating a research gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: The method introduces a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE) network with four key components: (1) a recoloring-based motion compensation module for inter-frame geometric alignment, (2) a channel-aware temporal attention module for highlighting relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames, (3) a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module for capturing spatial dependencies, and (4) a joint loss function based on Pearson correlation coefficient to reduce over-smoothing effects.

Result: When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with BD-rate reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5% for the Luma, Cb, and Cr components, respectively.

Conclusion: The proposed STQE network successfully exploits spatial-temporal correlations to significantly improve the visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds, demonstrating substantial performance gains across all color components with notable BD-rate reductions and PSNR improvements.

Abstract: Very few studies have addressed quality enhancement for compressed dynamic
point clouds. In particular, the effective exploitation of spatial-temporal
correlations between point cloud frames remains largely unexplored. Addressing
this gap, we propose a spatial-temporal attribute quality enhancement (STQE)
network that exploits both spatial and temporal correlations to improve the
visual quality of G-PCC compressed dynamic point clouds. Our contributions
include a recoloring-based motion compensation module that remaps reference
attribute information to the current frame geometry to achieve precise
inter-frame geometric alignment, a channel-aware temporal attention module that
dynamically highlights relevant regions across bidirectional reference frames,
a Gaussian-guided neighborhood feature aggregation module that efficiently
captures spatial dependencies between geometry and color attributes, and a
joint loss function based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, designed to
alleviate over-smoothing effects typical of point-wise mean squared error
optimization. When applied to the latest G-PCC test model, STQE achieved
improvements of 0.855 dB, 0.682 dB, and 0.828 dB in delta PSNR, with
Bj{\o}ntegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) reductions of -25.2%, -31.6%, and -32.5%

*Liwen Liu,Weidong Yang,Lipeng Ma,Ben Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MMPT, a multi-modal multi-task pre-training framework that combines three self-supervised tasks (token-level reconstruction, point-level reconstruction, and multi-modal contrastive learning) to enhance 3D point cloud understanding by leveraging both 3D and 2D data without requiring annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-modal pre-training frameworks for 3D representations rely on single pre-training tasks, which limits their ability to capture abundant information from other relevant tasks and hinders performance in downstream applications, especially in complex and diverse domains.

Method: The MMPT framework incorporates three complementary pre-training tasks: (1) Token-level reconstruction (TLR) for recovering masked point tokens to learn representative features, (2) Point-level reconstruction (PLR) for predicting masked point positions directly, and (3) Multi-modal contrastive learning (MCL) for learning feature correspondences within and across 3D point cloud and 2D image modalities in a self-supervised manner.

Result: The framework operates without requiring 3D annotations, making it scalable for large datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various downstream tasks, and experimental evaluation shows improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various discriminant and generative applications on widely-used benchmarks.

Conclusion: MMPT successfully addresses the limitations of single-task pre-training by combining multiple complementary tasks, demonstrating that multi-task multi-modal pre-training can significantly enhance 3D point cloud understanding and achieve superior performance on downstream tasks without requiring manual annotations.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training methods have shown promising
effectiveness in learning 3D representations by aligning multi-modal features
between 3D shapes and their corresponding 2D counterparts. However, existing
multi-modal pre-training frameworks primarily rely on a single pre-training
task to gather multi-modal data in 3D applications. This limitation prevents
the models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant
tasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in
complex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a
Multi-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud
understanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)
Token-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing
the model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level
reconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions
directly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed
point cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning
(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus
assembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image
modalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates
without requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large
datasets. The trained encoder can be effectively transferred to various
downstream tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we evaluated its
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in various discriminant and
generative applications under widely-used benchmarks.

Motivation: The growing versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding unauthorized modifications of private content. Existing protection mechanisms need improvement to effectively prevent malicious use of diffusion models.

Method: The authors propose HAAD (h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), which leverages adversarial attacks to craft perturbations targeting the semantic latent space (h-space) that encodes critical high-level features. They also introduce HAAD-KV, a more efficient variant that constructs perturbations based solely on the KV parameters of the h-space.

Result: The proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks in protecting against unauthorized customization. HAAD-KV provides stronger protection while being computationally less expensive than the original HAAD method.

Conclusion: The h-space based adversarial attack approach effectively degrades the image generation process of diffusion models, providing a practical solution for protecting private content from unauthorized modifications. The simplicity and effectiveness of these methods make them superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images from few
samples raises significant privacy concerns, particularly regarding
unauthorized modifications of private content. This concerning issue has
renewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial
attacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our
work is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of
abstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes
critical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In
this paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD
(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages
adversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can
efficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we
further introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs
perturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space. This strategy
offers a stronger protection, that is computationally less expensive. Despite
their simplicity, our methods outperform state-of-the-art adversarial attacks,
highlighting their effectiveness.

### [108] [Boosting Ray Search Procedure of Hard-label Attacks with Transfer-based Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17577)
*Chen Ma,Xinjie Xu,Shuyu Cheng,Qi Xuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes a prior-guided approach for hard-label black-box adversarial attacks that uses transfer-based priors from surrogate models to improve gradient estimation and reduce query requirements, achieving better efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-label black-box adversarial attacks are challenging because only the top-1 predicted label is available, making gradient estimation expensive in terms of queries. Existing methods use a "sign trick" for gradient estimation but still require many queries, limiting their practical effectiveness.

Method: The authors develop a prior-guided gradient estimation approach that integrates transfer-based priors from surrogate models with random directions. They approximate the projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and random directions in a query-efficient manner, improving upon the traditional "sign trick" used in existing ray search methods.

Result: Extensive experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of query efficiency. The authors also provide theoretical analysis showing improved expected cosine similarities between their gradient estimators and the true gradient.

Conclusion: The paper successfully demonstrates that incorporating transfer-based priors from surrogate models can substantially improve the efficiency of hard-label black-box adversarial attacks by providing better gradient estimation with fewer queries, making such attacks more practical and effective.

Abstract: One of the most practical and challenging types of black-box adversarial
attacks is the hard-label attack, where only the top-1 predicted label is
available. One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction
from the benign image that minimizes the $\ell_p$-norm distance to the
adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms
the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective
function value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at
a high query cost. Existing methods use a "sign trick" in gradient estimation
to reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the
quality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach
to improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.
Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and
our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the
projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and
random directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the
expected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the
true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating
priors. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
query efficiency.

*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Shuaifeng Zhi,Jiazhao Zhang,Zhoufeng Wang,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RemixFusion introduces a residual-based mixed representation combining explicit TSDF grids with implicit neural modules for high-quality, large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction, achieving superior mapping and tracking accuracy compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural implicit representations improve mapping completeness and memory efficiency over traditional explicit methods like TSDF, but suffer from lack of reconstruction details and time-consuming learning, limiting their application to large-scale online reconstruction scenarios.

Method: The method uses a residual-based mixed representation with: (1) explicit coarse TSDF grid combined with implicit neural module producing fine-grained detail residuals, (2) multi-frame joint pose optimization via bundle adjustment that optimizes pose changes rather than poses directly, (3) adaptive gradient amplification technique, and (4) local moving volume with divide-and-conquer design for efficient online learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show RemixFusion surpasses all state-of-the-art methods (both explicit and implicit representation-based) in terms of accuracy for both mapping and tracking on large-scale scenes, achieving detail-rich reconstruction within bounded time and memory constraints.

Conclusion: RemixFusion successfully addresses the limitations of purely implicit neural representations by combining them with explicit representations in a residual framework, enabling high-quality large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction with superior performance in both scene mapping and camera tracking compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled
the advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to
traditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping
completeness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details
and the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread
application of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We
introduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene
reconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and
large-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a
residual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and
an implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained
details to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for
detail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting
with the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus
paving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the
residual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via
bundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize
poses directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel
technique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better
optimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local
moving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a
divide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our
residual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
surpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit
or implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and
tracking on large-scale scenes.

*Maciej K. Wozniak,Lianhang Liu,Yixi Cai,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRIX is an efficient end-to-end autonomous driving model that uses only camera data and raw pixels (no LiDAR or BEV representation) to achieve state-of-the-art performance while being significantly smaller and faster than existing multimodal approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current end-to-end autonomous driving models face deployment challenges due to large model sizes, dependency on expensive LiDAR sensors, and computationally intensive BEV feature representations, limiting their scalability for mass-market camera-only vehicles.

Method: PRIX uses a visual feature extractor combined with a generative planning head to predict trajectories directly from raw camera pixels. The key innovation is the Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT) module that enhances multi-level visual features for robust planning without requiring BEV representation or LiDAR data.

Result: PRIX achieves state-of-the-art performance on NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching the capabilities of larger multimodal diffusion planners while being significantly more efficient in inference speed and model size.

Conclusion: PRIX demonstrates that efficient autonomous driving is possible using only camera data and raw pixels, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment in mass-market vehicles without sacrificing performance quality.

Abstract: While end-to-end autonomous driving models show promising results, their
practical deployment is often hindered by large model sizes, a reliance on
expensive LiDAR sensors and computationally intensive BEV feature
representations. This limits their scalability, especially for mass-market
vehicles equipped only with cameras. To address these challenges, we propose
PRIX (Plan from Raw Pixels). Our novel and efficient end-to-end driving
architecture operates using only camera data, without explicit BEV
representation and forgoing the need for LiDAR. PRIX leverages a visual feature
extractor coupled with a generative planning head to predict safe trajectories
from raw pixel inputs directly. A core component of our architecture is the
Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT), a novel module designed to
effectively enhance multi-level visual features for more robust planning. We
demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that PRIX achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching
the capabilities of larger, multimodal diffusion planners while being
significantly more efficient in terms of inference speed and model size, making
it a practical solution for real-world deployment. Our work is open-source and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InvRGB+L is a novel inverse rendering model that uses both RGB and LiDAR data to reconstruct large, relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single sequence, leveraging LiDAR intensity values for improved material estimation and enabling applications like relighting and night simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional inverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material estimates due to visible light interference. The authors found that LiDAR's intensity values, captured with active illumination in a different spectral range, offer complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting conditions.

Method: The method introduces two key innovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model that incorporates LiDAR intensity information, and (2) RGB-LiDAR material consistency losses that ensure coherent material estimation across both modalities. The approach leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome challenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics.

Result: The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR renderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports various applications including relighting, night simulations, and dynamic object insertions. The results surpass current state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering and LiDAR simulation.

Conclusion: InvRGB+L successfully demonstrates that incorporating LiDAR intensity information significantly improves inverse rendering performance, particularly for material estimation in challenging lighting conditions. The method advances the state-of-the-art in both urban scene reconstruction and LiDAR simulation through its physics-based approach and multi-modal consistency constraints.

Abstract: We present InvRGB+L, a novel inverse rendering model that reconstructs large,
relightable, and dynamic scenes from a single RGB+LiDAR sequence. Conventional

mainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material
estimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity
values-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer
complementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.
Inspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome

*Miguel Carrasco,César González-Martín,José Aranda,Luis Oliveros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This study compares human visual attention patterns with Vision Transformer (ViT) attention mechanisms when evaluating handcrafted objects, finding that certain ViT attention heads can approximate human visual behavior, particularly attention head #12 at optimal correlation parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual attention mechanisms are crucial for human perception and aesthetic evaluation, but the alignment between human visual attention patterns and Vision Transformer attention mechanisms remains underexplored, particularly in aesthetic contexts involving handcrafted objects.

Method: Conducted eye-tracking experiment with 30 participants viewing 20 artisanal objects (basketry bags and ginger jars) using Pupil Labs eye-tracker to generate human attention heat maps. Analyzed same objects using pre-trained ViT model with DINO, extracting attention maps from 12 attention heads. Compared human and ViT attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0).

Result: Optimal correlation found at sigma=2.4 ±0.03, with attention head #12 showing strongest alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences between attention heads were observed, with heads #7 and #9 showing greatest divergence from human attention (p<0.05). ViTs exhibited more global attention patterns compared to human focal attention, but certain heads could approximate human behavior for specific features like buckles.

Conclusion: While ViTs show more global attention patterns compared to human focal attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior for specific object features. These findings suggest potential applications in product design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences between human perception and current AI models' attention strategies.

Abstract: Visual attention mechanisms play a crucial role in human perception and
aesthetic evaluation. Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in computer vision tasks, yet their
alignment with human visual attention patterns remains underexplored,
particularly in aesthetic contexts. This study investigates the correlation
between human visual attention and ViT attention mechanisms when evaluating
handcrafted objects. We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30
participants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal
objects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs
eye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing
human visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a
pre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting
attention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT
attention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying
Gaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal
correlation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest
alignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found
between attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest
divergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate
that while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal
attention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,
particularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These
findings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product
design and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in
attention strategies between human perception and current AI models.

TL;DR: A one-stage architecture for autonomous driving that simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines, and topology relationships, achieving better accuracy and efficiency than existing two-stage methods by reusing attention resources and enabling knowledge distillation from SD map models to non-SD map models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing two-stage methods for lane topology understanding in autonomous driving suffer from inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads, creating a need for a more efficient and accurate approach to understanding lane topology relationships critical for safe autonomous driving.

Method: A one-stage architecture that simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology relationships by reusing intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders, leveraging inherent relational knowledge from element detection to model topology relationships without additional graph networks, and implementing knowledge distillation from SD map models to non-SD map models.

Result: The approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and efficiency on the OpenLane-V2 dataset, achieving superior results in lane detection, traffic element identification, and topology reasoning, while demonstrating that knowledge distillation enables superior performance even without SD maps.

Conclusion: The proposed one-stage architecture successfully addresses the limitations of existing two-stage methods by improving both accuracy and inference speed for lane topology understanding, while pioneering knowledge distillation techniques that enable effective operation without standard definition maps.

Abstract: Understanding lane toplogy relationships accurately is critical for safe
autonomous driving. However, existing two-stage methods suffer from
inefficiencies due to error propagations and increased computational overheads.
To address these challenges, we propose a one-stage architecture that
simultaneously predicts traffic elements, lane centerlines and topology
relationship, improving both the accuracy and inference speed of lane topology
understanding for autonomous driving. Our key innovation lies in reusing
intermediate attention resources within distinct transformer decoders. This
approach effectively leverages the inherent relational knowledge within the
element detection module to enable the modeling of topology relationships among
traffic elements and lanes without requiring additional computationally
expensive graph networks. Furthermore, we are the first to demonstrate that
knowledge can be distilled from models that utilize standard definition (SD)
maps to those operates without using SD maps, enabling superior performance
even in the absence of SD maps. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
dataset show that our approach outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy

*Thomas M. Metz,Matthew Q. Hill,Alice J. O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ECHO-BID, a person re-identification model based on EVA-02 Large backbones that achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term re-identification tasks, especially in challenging scenarios with clothing changes and occlusions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Person identification in unconstrained environments faces significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging conditions, and clothing changes. Existing methods struggle with long-term re-identification scenarios where people change clothes or appear in occluded settings.

Method: The authors developed ECHO-BID (Eva Clothes-Change from Hidden Objects - Body IDentification) using object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. They systematically compared 9 models varying in backbone architecture, model size, scale of object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocols. The approach leverages Masked Image Modeling during pretraining and uses transfer learning on challenging clothes-change datasets.

Result: ECHO-BID achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-identification benchmarks, substantially outperforming other methods across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded settings. The model showed particularly strong performance in occluded viewing scenarios. Key findings include that increased model size and Masked Image Modeling contribute to performance, and that smaller but more challenging transfer learning datasets can generalize better than larger, less challenging ones.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that selecting appropriate pretrained backbone architectures and transfer learning protocols can drive substantial improvements in long-term person re-identification performance. The combination of larger model size, Masked Image Modeling pretraining, and strategic transfer learning on challenging datasets proves effective for handling clothing changes and occlusions in person re-identification tasks.

Abstract: Person identification in unconstrained viewing environments presents
significant challenges due to variations in distance, viewpoint, imaging
conditions, and clothing. We introduce $\textbf{E}$va $\textbf{C}$lothes-Change
from $\textbf{H}$idden $\textbf{O}$bjects - $\textbf{B}$ody
$\textbf{ID}$entification (ECHO-BID), a class of long-term re-id models built
on object-pretrained EVA-02 Large backbones. We compare ECHO-BID to 9 other
models that vary systematically in backbone architecture, model size, scale of
object classification pretraining, and transfer learning protocol. Models were
evaluated on benchmark datasets across constrained, unconstrained, and occluded
settings. ECHO-BID, with transfer learning on the most challenging
clothes-change data, achieved state-of-the-art results on long-term re-id --
substantially outperforming other methods. ECHO-BID also surpassed other
methods by a wide margin in occluded viewing scenarios. A combination of
increased model size and Masked Image Modeling during pretraining underlie
ECHO-BID's strong performance on long-term re-id. Notably, a smaller, but more
challenging transfer learning dataset, generalized better across datasets than
a larger, less challenging one. However, the larger dataset with an additional
fine-tuning step proved best on the most difficult data. Selecting the correct
pretrained backbone architecture and transfer learning protocols can drive
substantial gains in long-term re-id performance.

*Olaf Dünkel,Artur Jesslen,Jiahao Xie,Christian Theobalt,Christian Rupprecht,Adam Kortylewski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces CNS-Bench, a continuous nuisance shift benchmark that uses diffusion models with LoRA adapters to evaluate image classifier robustness against realistic out-of-distribution scenarios with varying severity levels, revealing that model rankings change across different shift types and scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OOD robustness evaluation methods using simple synthetic corruptions fail to capture real-world nuisance shifts, and recent diffusion-based approaches are limited to binary shifts. There's a need for continuous, realistic benchmarking that can reveal nuanced model performance differences across varying severity levels.

Method: The authors develop CNS-Bench using LoRA adapters applied to diffusion models to generate continuous severity levels of realistic nuisance shifts. They propose a filtering mechanism to address failure cases and enable reliable benchmarking with generative models.

Result: Large-scale evaluation of over 40 classifiers shows that model rankings change across different nuisance shifts and severity scales, which cannot be captured by binary shift evaluations. The continuous evaluation approach successfully identifies model failure points and provides more detailed robustness understanding.

Conclusion: CNS-Bench provides a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of classifier robustness compared to existing methods. The continuous nature of the benchmark reveals important insights about model performance that are missed by binary evaluation approaches, enabling better understanding of model failure modes and robustness characteristics.

Abstract: An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is
to evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.
While simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,
they often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.
Recently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for
benchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,
we introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD
robustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative
nuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual
nuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion
models. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that
outperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with
generative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study
to evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance
shifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model
rankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be
captured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that
evaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the
identification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding
of model robustness. Project page including code and data:

*Yotam Erel,Olaf Dünkel,Rishabh Dabral,Vladislav Golyanik,Christian Theobalt,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a novel interpretation of attention matrices in vision transformers as discrete-time Markov chains, enabling analysis of both direct and indirect attention relationships. This framework reveals metastable states corresponding to semantically similar regions and introduces TokenRank for measuring global token importance, achieving state-of-the-art results in zero-shot segmentation and improvements in image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous attention studies only model immediate effects between tokens, missing the broader context of how attention propagates through multiple steps. There's a need for a unified framework that can explain common attention operations (selection, summation, averaging) and capture indirect attention relationships that reveal semantic structure in visual data.

Method: The authors reinterpret attention matrices as discrete-time Markov chains where attention scores represent transition probabilities between tokens. They analyze metastable states through matrix multiplication and eigenanalysis to identify semantically similar token clusters. They introduce TokenRank as the steady-state vector of the Markov chain to measure global token importance across the entire sequence.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot segmentation by leveraging metastable states that correspond to semantically coherent regions. TokenRank demonstrates improvements in unconditional image generation tasks. The approach successfully identifies attention clusters in semantically similar regions while showing that noisy attention scores tend to disperse.

Conclusion: The Markov chain interpretation provides a fresh and unified perspective on attention mechanisms in vision transformers, enabling analysis of both direct and indirect attention relationships. The framework offers practical tools for understanding token interactions and demonstrates clear benefits for downstream tasks like segmentation and image generation.

Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of the attention matrix as a discrete-time
Markov chain. Our interpretation sheds light on common operations involving
attention scores such as selection, summation, and averaging in a unified
framework. It further extends them by considering indirect attention,
propagated through the Markov chain, as opposed to previous studies that only
model immediate effects. Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to
semantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the
attention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable
states and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix
multiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively. Using these lightweight tools,
we demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation. Lastly, we define
TokenRank -- the steady state vector of the Markov chain, which measures global
token importance. We demonstrate that using it brings improvements in
unconditional image generation. We believe our framework offers a fresh view of
how tokens are being attended in modern visual transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synergos-VQA introduces a novel synergistic reasoning framework for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering that combines three types of evidence (holistic, structural, and causal) to achieve comprehensive understanding, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks while demonstrating strong plug-and-play capabilities with various MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering are bottlenecked by relying on uni-dimensional evidence, following a "seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach that prevents robust, multi-faceted understanding.

Method: Synergos-VQA framework concurrently generates and fuses three complementary evidence streams: (1) Holistic Evidence to perceive the entire scene ("forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a prototype-driven module to identify key objects ("trees"), and (3) Causal Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure robustly grounded reasoning.

Result: Synergos-VQA establishes new state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, while demonstrating strong plug-and-play capabilities that significantly boost various open-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: The synergistic fusion of multi-faceted evidence achieves more comprehensive and reliable reasoning processes, proving that superior methodological design can outperform sheer model scale in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have pushed the frontiers of
Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA), yet their reasoning is
fundamentally bottlenecked by a reliance on uni-dimensional evidence. This
"seeing only the trees, but not the forest" approach prevents robust,
multi-faceted understanding. Inspired by the principle of seeing both the
forest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning
framework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three
complementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to
perceive the entire scene (the "forest"), (2) Structural Evidence from a
prototype-driven module to identify key objects (the "trees"), and (3) Causal
Evidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly
grounded. By synergistically fusing this multi-faceted evidence, our framework
achieves a more comprehensive and reliable reasoning process. Extensive
experiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new
state-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.
Furthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,
significantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior

### [119] [Monocular Semantic Scene Completion via Masked Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17661)
*Xuzhi Wang,Xinran Wu,Song Wang,Lingdong Kong,Ziping Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage framework (MonoMRN) for monocular semantic scene completion that decomposes the task into coarse completion followed by refinement using a Masked Recurrent Network with sparse GRU design, achieving state-of-the-art performance on indoor and outdoor datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing single-stage MSSC methods struggle with simultaneously performing visible region segmentation and occluded region hallucination while being affected by inaccurate depth estimation, leading to suboptimal performance especially in complex scenes.

Method: A novel two-stage framework decomposing MSSC into: (1) coarse MSSC, followed by (2) Masked Recurrent Network with Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent Unit (MS-GRU) that focuses on occupied regions through mask updating mechanism and sparse GRU design for computational efficiency, plus distance attention projection to reduce projection errors.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NYUv2 and SemanticKITTI datasets for both indoor and outdoor scenes. Robustness analysis shows the Masked Recurrent Network enhances model resilience to various disturbances.

Conclusion: The proposed MonoMRN framework effectively addresses limitations of single-stage methods by decomposing the task into two stages, with the Masked Recurrent Network providing improved performance and robustness for monocular semantic scene completion across different environments.

Abstract: Monocular Semantic Scene Completion (MSSC) aims to predict the voxel-wise
occupancy and semantic category from a single-view RGB image. Existing methods
adopt a single-stage framework that aims to simultaneously achieve visible
region segmentation and occluded region hallucination, while also being
affected by inaccurate depth estimation. Such methods often achieve suboptimal
performance, especially in complex scenes. We propose a novel two-stage
framework that decomposes MSSC into coarse MSSC followed by the Masked
Recurrent Network. Specifically, we propose the Masked Sparse Gated Recurrent
Unit (MS-GRU) which concentrates on the occupied regions by the proposed mask
updating mechanism, and a sparse GRU design is proposed to reduce the
computation cost. Additionally, we propose the distance attention projection to
reduce projection errors by assigning different attention scores according to
the distance to the observed surface. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed unified framework, MonoMRN, effectively supports both indoor and
outdoor scenes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NYUv2 and
SemanticKITTI datasets. Furthermore, we conduct robustness analysis under
various disturbances, highlighting the role of the Masked Recurrent Network in
enhancing the model's resilience to such challenges. The source code is
publicly available.

*Lingdong Kong,Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Rong Li,Yuhao Dong,Tianshuai Hu,Lai Xing Ng,Wei Tsang Ooi,Benoit R. Cottereau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding in event cameras, along with EventRefer framework that uses multi-attribute representations to connect asynchronous event streams with human language for dynamic environment understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras provide microsecond-level latency and motion blur robustness ideal for dynamic environments, but connecting these asynchronous streams to human language remains challenging. There's a need for bridging event-based perception with natural language understanding for robotics and autonomous systems.

Method: The authors propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding framework that uses a Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE) to dynamically fuse multi-attribute representations. The method incorporates four grounding attributes: appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to other objects, enabling spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning across different modalities.

Result: EventRefer achieves consistent gains over state-of-the-art baselines across event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. The Talk2Event dataset provides over 30,000 validated referring expressions built from real-world driving data, establishing a comprehensive benchmark for language-driven event-based perception.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for advancing multimodal, temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and autonomy by successfully connecting event camera data with natural language through attribute-aware grounding and comprehensive benchmarking.

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond-level latency and robustness to motion blur,
making them ideal for understanding dynamic environments. Yet, connecting these
asynchronous streams to human language remains an open challenge. We introduce
Talk2Event, the first large-scale benchmark for language-driven object
grounding in event-based perception. Built from real-world driving data, we
provide over 30,000 validated referring expressions, each enriched with four
grounding attributes -- appearance, status, relation to viewer, and relation to
other objects -- bridging spatial, temporal, and relational reasoning. To fully
exploit these cues, we propose EventRefer, an attribute-aware grounding
framework that dynamically fuses multi-attribute representations through a
Mixture of Event-Attribute Experts (MoEE). Our method adapts to different
modalities and scene dynamics, achieving consistent gains over state-of-the-art
baselines in event-only, frame-only, and event-frame fusion settings. We hope
our dataset and approach will establish a foundation for advancing multimodal,
temporally-aware, and language-driven perception in real-world robotics and
autonomy.

Abstract: With the rise of robotics, LiDAR-based 3D object detection has garnered
significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets
and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other
autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET,
the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations
collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby
facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well
as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel
cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the
well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves
perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric

resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios,
providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging

### [122] [BetterCheck: Towards Safeguarding VLMs for Automotive Perception Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17722)
*Malsha Ashani Mahawatta Dona,Beatriz Cabrero-Daniel,Yinan Yu,Christian Berger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper evaluates state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (VLMs) for automotive perception systems, finding that while they show impressive understanding of complex traffic situations, they are prone to hallucinations that could be dangerous for autonomous driving, and proposes BetterCheck as a hallucination detection strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models show promising capabilities for understanding complex traffic situations beyond traditional object detection systems like YOLO, but their tendency to hallucinate (missing or fabricating traffic agents) poses serious safety risks for autonomous driving systems, especially when missing vulnerable road users could lead to disastrous decisions.

Method: Systematic assessment of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on diverse traffic situations from the Waymo Open Dataset to evaluate their performance and identify hallucination patterns, along with development of BetterCheck, a proposed hallucination detection strategy for VLM-supported perception systems.

Result: Both proprietary and open VLMs demonstrated remarkable image understanding capabilities with attention to fine details sometimes difficult for humans to spot, but they still exhibit hallucination tendencies by either missing present traffic agents or fabricating non-existent ones, requiring dedicated detection strategies.

Conclusion: While VLMs show impressive potential for automotive perception systems with superior understanding of complex traffic situations compared to specialized neural networks, their hallucination problems necessitate safety guardrails and detection mechanisms like BetterCheck before they can be safely deployed in autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal
data such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in
understanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks
(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited
vocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being
non-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models
(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.
This is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception
systems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case
situation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to
either potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who
are present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in
reality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving
systems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous
decisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the
performance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic
situations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for
capturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe
that both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding
capabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult
to spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements
in their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such
as BetterCheck that we propose in our work.

*Kagan Ozturk,Louisa Conwill,Jacob Gutierrez,Kevin Bowyer,Walter J. Scheirer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to study how facial filters from social media apps affect automated face recognition systems, analyzing filters from Instagram, Snapchat, Meitu, and Pitu to reveal cross-cultural differences and proposing methods to detect and mitigate filtering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies on facial filters' impact on face recognition were limited to small numbers of hand-picked filters in specific styles, failing to capture the wide variety of filters available across different social media platforms and cultures.

Method: The authors developed a framework consisting of: (1) a controlled dataset of face images, (2) a principled filter selection process to choose representative filters for experimentation, and (3) systematic experiments to evaluate filters' impact on recognition performance across American apps (Instagram, Snapchat) and Chinese apps (Meitu, Pitu).

Result: The framework successfully revealed cross-cultural differences in how facial filters affect automated face recognition systems between American and Chinese social media applications, and demonstrated that filtering effects can be detected in face embedding spaces.

Conclusion: The study shows that filtering effects in face embedding space can be easily detected and restored to improve face recognition performance, providing a practical solution to mitigate the negative impact of facial filters on automated recognition systems.

Abstract: Facial filters are now commonplace for social media users around the world.
Previous work has demonstrated that facial filters can negatively impact
automated face recognition performance. However, these studies focus on small
numbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more
effectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social
media applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study
of the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework
includes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection
process that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and
a set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We
demonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American
applications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu
to uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering
effect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve
face recognition performance.

which consists of four main components, including camera motion quantization,
video generation architecture, advanced sampler, and model acceleration. First,
we quantize camera motions for stable training and user-friendly interaction
using keyboard inputs. Then, we introduce the Masked Video Diffusion

*Yiwen Chen,Zhihao Li,Yikai Wang,Hu Zhang,Qin Li,Chi Zhang,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ultra3D is an efficient 3D generation framework that accelerates sparse voxel modeling by using VecSet representation for coarse layout generation and Part Attention mechanism for localized feature refinement, achieving 6.7x speed-up while maintaining high-resolution 3D generation quality at 1024 resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse voxel-based 3D generation frameworks suffer from severe computational inefficiencies due to quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms in two-stage diffusion pipelines, limiting their practical application despite improved quality in 3D content generation.

Method: The method uses VecSet representation for efficient coarse object layout generation in the first stage to reduce token count, and introduces Part Attention - a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions in the second stage. A scalable part annotation pipeline converts raw meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels to support this approach.

Result: Ultra3D achieves up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation while supporting high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Ultra3D successfully addresses computational inefficiencies in sparse voxel-based 3D generation by introducing efficient representations and localized attention mechanisms, enabling practical high-resolution 3D content generation with significant speed improvements without quality compromise.

Abstract: Recent advances in sparse voxel representations have significantly improved
the quality of 3D content generation, enabling high-resolution modeling with
fine-grained geometry. However, existing frameworks suffer from severe
computational inefficiencies due to the quadratic complexity of attention
mechanisms in their two-stage diffusion pipelines. In this work, we propose
Ultra3D, an efficient 3D generation framework that significantly accelerates
sparse voxel modeling without compromising quality. Our method leverages the
compact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in
the first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate
prediction. To refine per-voxel latent features in the second stage, we
introduce Part Attention, a geometry-aware localized attention mechanism that
restricts attention computation within semantically consistent part regions.
This design preserves structural continuity while avoiding unnecessary global
attention, achieving up to 6.7x speed-up in latent generation. To support this
mechanism, we construct a scalable part annotation pipeline that converts raw
meshes into part-labeled sparse voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Ultra3D supports high-resolution 3D generation at 1024 resolution and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both visual fidelity and user preference.

*Mashiro Toyooka,Kiyoharu Aizawa,Yoko Yamakata*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: This paper evaluates how well Large Language Models (LLMs) understand cooking processes by testing their ability to track ingredient state changes during recipe procedures, using a new Japanese recipe dataset with detailed ingredient state annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are trained on procedural texts but don't directly observe real-world phenomena. In cooking recipes, intermediate ingredient states are often omitted, making it challenging for models to accurately track ingredient transformations and understand recipes properly.

Method: The authors apply state probing to cooking domain by: (1) constructing a Japanese recipe dataset with clear ingredient state change annotations from well-structured recipe texts, and (2) designing three novel tasks to evaluate LLMs' ability to track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients at intermediate cooking steps.

Result: Experiments with widely used LLMs (Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B) demonstrate that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs.

Conclusion: State probing can effectively evaluate and improve LLMs' understanding of cooking procedures. The proposed dataset and tasks successfully assess models' ability to track ingredient states, and training on ingredient state knowledge enhances LLMs' cooking process comprehension.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural
texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of
cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients
are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states
and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a
method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the
domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well
LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We
first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate
annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and
controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to
evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify
ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used
LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state
knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving
performance comparable to commercial LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper introduces FundusExpert, an ophthalmology-specific multimodal large language model that integrates positioning and diagnostic reasoning capabilities, achieving superior performance in ophthalmic tasks through a novel dataset construction approach and clinically-aligned cognitive chains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal large language models face critical challenges in specialized medical domains like ophthalmology, specifically fragmentation of annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which hinder precise cross-modal understanding and accurate medical diagnosis.

Method: The authors developed FundusExpert using the FundusGen dataset, constructed through an intelligent Fundus-Engine system that automates localization and uses MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis. They also constructed clinically aligned cognitive chains to guide interpretable reasoning paths.

The study also revealed a scaling law between data quality and model capability (L ∝ N^0.068).

Conclusion: The work successfully develops a scalable, clinically-aligned MLLM for ophthalmology that bridges the visual-language gap in specialized medical domains. The cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance data utilization efficiency, providing a pathway for developing domain-specific MLLMs with integrated positioning-diagnosis capabilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in
the field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in
specialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of
annotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which
hinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,
an ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning
capabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the

leverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease
classification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis
within a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically
aligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable

achieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,
surpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in
zero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,
significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling
law between data quality and model capability ($L \propto N^{0.068}$),
demonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance
data utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with
diagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: InstructVLA is an end-to-end vision-language-action model that preserves flexible reasoning capabilities while achieving superior manipulation performance through a novel Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT) paradigm with mixture-of-experts adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language-action models face a trade-off between multimodal reasoning and precise action generation, often narrowing to task-specific data and suffering catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. There's a need to bridge flexible reasoning with effective real-world robot manipulation.

Method: The paper introduces Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which uses multimodal training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual reasoning and action generation. Training is performed on both standard VLM corpora and a curated 650K-sample VLA-IT dataset.

Result: InstructVLA achieves 30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA on SimplerEnv tasks, outperforms fine-tuned OpenVLA by 92% and GPT-4o-aided action expert by 29% on the new SimplerEnv-Instruct benchmark (80 tasks). It also surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and demonstrates inference-time scaling capabilities.

Conclusion: InstructVLA successfully bridges intuitive human-robot interaction with efficient policy learning, demonstrating the potential for maintaining both flexible reasoning and superior manipulation performance without catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained capabilities.

Abstract: To operate effectively in the real world, robots must integrate multimodal
reasoning with precise action generation. However, existing
vision-language-action (VLA) models often sacrifice one for the other, narrow
their abilities to task-specific manipulation data, and suffer catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained vision-language capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
introduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible
reasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading
manipulation performance. InstructVLA introduces a novel training paradigm,
Vision-Language-Action Instruction Tuning (VLA-IT), which employs multimodal
training with mixture-of-experts adaptation to jointly optimize textual
reasoning and action generation on both standard VLM corpora and a curated
650K-sample VLA-IT dataset. On in-domain SimplerEnv tasks, InstructVLA achieves
30.5% improvement over SpatialVLA. To evaluate generalization, we introduce
SimplerEnv-Instruct, an 80-task benchmark requiring closed-loop control and
high-level instruction understanding, where it outperforms a fine-tuned OpenVLA
by 92% and an action expert aided by GPT-4o by 29%. Additionally, InstructVLA
surpasses baseline VLMs on multimodal tasks and exhibits inference-time scaling
by leveraging textual reasoning to boost manipulation performance in both
simulated and real-world settings. These results demonstrate InstructVLA's
potential for bridging intuitive and steerable human-robot interaction with
efficient policy learning.

### [129] [CA-Cut: Crop-Aligned Cutout for Data Augmentation to Learn More Robust Under-Canopy Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17727)
*Robel Mamo,Taeyeong Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper proposes Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut), a novel data augmentation technique that strategically masks regions around crop rows to improve robustness of deep learning models for under-canopy navigation, achieving up to 36.9% reduction in prediction error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visual under-canopy navigation methods require large amounts of training data for reliable field deployment, but data collection is costly and time-consuming. Standard augmentation techniques may be suboptimal for complex under-canopy environments with frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform crop spacing.

Method: The authors propose Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut), a masking-based augmentation method that randomly masks regions spatially distributed around crop rows on the sides. This technique encourages models to capture high-level contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed, simulating real-world occlusions in agricultural environments.

Result: Extensive experiments on a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that CA-Cut significantly improves robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual navigation. The method achieves up to 36.9% reduction in prediction error and enhances both prediction accuracy and generalizability across diverse environments. Ablation studies optimize mask parameters including number, size, and spatial distribution.

Conclusion: Masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions in under-canopy environments. Biasing mask distribution toward crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for improving model performance. The proposed method offers a cost-effective solution to enhance model robustness without requiring additional data collection, making it valuable for agricultural robotics applications.

Abstract: State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with
deep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from
crop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they
require large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world
field deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant
human resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this
challenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during
model training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to
diversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we
hypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to
suboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with
frequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we
propose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)
which masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed
around crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level
contextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our
extensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that
masking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and
significantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual
navigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward
crop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and
generalizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction
in prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the
number of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks
to maximize overall performance.

TL;DR: A simple quantization-aware training approach that reduces LLM inference costs with minimal accuracy loss, requiring less than 0.1% additional training budget while outperforming existing methods across different model architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models need quantization to reduce inference latency, model size, and energy consumption for better user experience at lower cost, but existing methods either lose too much accuracy or require mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators.

Method: An end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that can be applied to activations, cache, and weights without introducing additional operations beyond quantization itself, generalizing across different model architectures.

Result: The method outperforms leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern benchmarks, working effectively for both base and instruct model variants with less than 0.1% increase in total training budget.

Conclusion: The proposed simple quantization-aware training approach successfully achieves efficient LLM quantization with minimal accuracy degradation and training overhead, while maintaining compatibility with specialized inference accelerators across various model architectures.

Abstract: Large language models can be quantized to reduce inference time latency,
model size, and energy consumption, thereby delivering a better user experience
at lower cost. A challenge exists to deliver quantized models with minimal loss
of accuracy in reasonable time, and in particular to do so without requiring
mechanisms incompatible with specialized inference accelerators. Here, we
demonstrate a simple, end-to-end quantization-aware training approach that,
with an increase in total model training budget of less than 0.1%, outperforms
the leading published quantization methods by large margins on several modern
benchmarks, with both base and instruct model variants. The approach easily
generalizes across different model architectures, can be applied to
activations, cache, and weights, and requires the introduction of no additional
operations to the model other than the quantization itself.

### [131] [DNT: a Deeply Normalized Transformer that can be trained by Momentum SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17501)
*Xianbiao Qi,Marco Chen,Wenjie Xiao,Jiaquan Ye,Yelin He,Chun-Guang Li,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT) that enables effective training with vanilla momentum SGD instead of requiring adaptive optimizers like AdamW, achieved through strategic normalization placement to concentrate gradient distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Transformers require advanced adaptive optimizers like AdamW for training due to heavy-tailed gradient distributions, making them incompatible with simpler momentum SGD optimizers. This limitation restricts training flexibility and efficiency.

Method: The authors develop Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT) by strategically integrating normalization techniques at proper positions within the Transformer architecture to modulate Jacobian matrices, balance the influence of weights and activations, and concentrate gradient distributions to enable vanilla momentum SGD training.

Result: DNT outperforms standard Transformer variants (ViT and GPT) and can be effectively trained using vanilla momentum SGD, achieving comparable performance to Transformers trained with AdamW while using a simpler optimizer.

Conclusion: The strategic placement of normalization in DNT successfully addresses the gradient distribution issues in Transformers, enabling the use of simpler momentum SGD optimizers without performance degradation, providing both theoretical justification and empirical validation across popular Transformer architectures.

Abstract: Transformers have become the de facto backbone of modern deep learning, yet
their training typically demands an advanced optimizer with adaptive learning
rate like AdamW, rather than a momentum SGDW (mSGDW). Previous works show that
it is mainly due to a heavy-tailed distribution of the gradients. In this
paper, we introduce a Deeply Normalized Transformer (DNT), which is
meticulously engineered to overcome this limitation enabling seamless training
with vanilla mSGDW while yielding comparable performance to the Transformers
trained via AdamW. To be specific, in DNT, we strategically integrate
normalization techniques at proper positions in the Transformers to effectively
modulate the Jacobian matrices of each layer, balance the influence of weights,
activations, and their interactions, and thus enable the distributions of
gradients concentrated. We provide both theoretical justifications of the
normalization technique used in our DNT and extensive empirical evaluation on
two popular Transformer architectures to validate that: a) DNT outperforms its
counterparts (\ie, ViT and GPT), and b) DNT can be effectively trained with
vanilla mSGDW.

*Anisha Gunjal,Anthony Wang,Elaine Lau,Vaskar Nath,Bing Liu,Sean Hendryx*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces "Rubrics as Rewards" (RaR), a framework that uses structured checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals for training language models, achieving up to 28% improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to traditional preference-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world tasks often lack single ground truth for reliable reward signals in reinforcement learning, and traditional preference-based methods rely on opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious correlations. There's a need for more interpretable and reliable reward mechanisms for post-training language models.

Method: The paper proposes Rubrics as Rewards (RaR), a framework that employs structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals for on-policy training with GRPO (presumably a policy optimization method). This approach treats rubrics as structured reward signals to improve alignment with human preferences.

Result: The best RaR method achieves up to 28% relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based approaches, while matching or surpassing performance of reward signals derived from expert-written references. The method enables smaller-scale judge models to better align with human preferences and maintains robust performance across different model scales.

Conclusion: Structured rubrics can serve as effective and interpretable reward signals for reinforcement learning in language model training, providing better performance than traditional preference-based methods while maintaining interpretability and robustness across model scales.

Abstract: Extending Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to real-world
tasks often requires balancing objective and subjective evaluation criteria.
However, many such tasks lack a single, unambiguous ground truth-making it
difficult to define reliable reward signals for post-training language models.
While traditional preference-based methods offer a workaround, they rely on
opaque reward functions that are difficult to interpret and prone to spurious
correlations. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), a framework
that uses structured, checklist-style rubrics as interpretable reward signals
for on-policy training with GRPO. Our best RaR method yields up to a $28\%$
relative improvement on HealthBench-1k compared to simple Likert-based
approaches, while matching or surpassing the performance of reward signals
derived from expert-written references. By treating rubrics as structured
reward signals, we show that RaR enables smaller-scale judge models to better
align with human preferences and sustain robust performance across model
scales.

### [133] [SADA: Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17135)
*Ting Jiang,Yixiao Wang,Hancheng Ye,Zishan Shao,Jingwei Sun,Jingyang Zhang,Zekai Chen,Jianyi Zhang,Yiran Chen,Hai Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADA is a novel acceleration method for diffusion models that adaptively applies sparsity to both sampling steps and attention tokens based on a unified stability criterion, achieving 1.8x+ speedups with minimal quality loss across multiple models and modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from high computational costs due to iterative sampling and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration methods reduce computation but sacrifice fidelity because they don't consider varying denoising trajectories across prompts and ignore the underlying ODE formulation.

Method: SADA (Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration) uses a single stability criterion to unify step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions. It adaptively allocates sparsity based on sampling trajectory and introduces principled approximation schemes leveraging gradient information from numerical ODE solvers.

Result: Achieves consistent ≥1.8× speedups with minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS ≤0.10 and FID ≤4.5) on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux models using EDM and DPM++ solvers. Successfully adapts to ControlNet without modifications and accelerates MusicLDM by 1.8× with ~0.01 spectrogram LPIPS.

Conclusion: SADA significantly outperforms prior acceleration methods by addressing fundamental issues in existing approaches through adaptive sparsity allocation and ODE-aware approximations, demonstrating broad applicability across different pipelines and modalities.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but
suffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process
and quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies
that reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling
time, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We
hypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts
correspond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not
consider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this
paper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a
novel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a
single stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative
models (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates
sparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled
approximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the
numerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using
both EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\ge 1.8\times$ speedups with
minimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\leq 0.10$ and FID $\leq 4.5$) compared to
unmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods. Moreover, SADA
adapts seamlessly to other pipelines and modalities: It accelerates ControlNet
without any modifications and speeds up MusicLDM by $1.8\times$ with $\sim
0.01$ spectrogram LPIPS.

### [134] [Dataset Distillation as Data Compression: A Rate-Utility Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17221)
*Youneng Bao,Yiping Liu,Zhuo Chen,Yongsheng Liang,Mu Li,Kede Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset distillation that achieves up to 170× greater compression than standard methods while maintaining comparable accuracy by parameterizing synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes and trading off storage efficiency with utility via Lagrange multipliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dataset distillation methods either focus on maximizing performance under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations for redundancy removal, but fail to jointly optimize both objectives. Modern machine learning's demand for ever-larger datasets creates prohibitive computational and storage requirements that need to be addressed through better compression techniques.

Method: The authors parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes that are decoded by extremely lightweight networks. They estimate the Shannon entropy of quantized latents as the rate measure and use existing distillation loss as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. They introduce "bits per class" (bpc) as a precise storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs.

Result: The method achieves up to 170× greater compression than standard distillation methods at comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128 datasets. Across diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, the approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.

Conclusion: The proposed joint rate-utility optimization framework successfully addresses the limitation of existing dataset distillation methods by simultaneously optimizing storage efficiency and performance. The method demonstrates superior compression capabilities while maintaining accuracy, providing a more effective solution for dataset distillation across various settings and architectures.

Abstract: Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning
increasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive
computational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by
compressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while
preserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance
under fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations
for redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this
work, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset
distillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes
decoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of
quantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss
as the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable
fair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise
storage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\times$
greater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across
diverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our
approach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs.

### [135] [Joint Asymmetric Loss for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17692)
*Jialiang Wang,Xianming Liu,Xiong Zhou,Gangfeng Hu,Deming Zhai,Junjun Jiang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL), a novel robust loss framework that extends asymmetric losses to complex passive loss scenarios, addressing the underfitting issues of symmetric losses in noisy label learning while maintaining superior theoretical properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetric losses used in noisy label learning suffer from underfitting due to overly strict constraints. While asymmetric losses have superior theoretical properties, they are incompatible with advanced optimization frameworks like Active Passive Loss (APL), limiting their potential in practical applications.

Method: The authors extend asymmetric loss to passive loss scenarios by proposing Asymmetric Mean Square Error (AMSE) and establishing necessary and sufficient conditions for the asymmetric property. They then substitute the traditional symmetric passive loss in APL with AMSE to create the Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL) framework.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that JAL effectively mitigates label noise and outperforms existing methods. The proposed AMSE successfully maintains asymmetric properties while being compatible with the APL optimization framework.

Conclusion: The Joint Asymmetric Loss framework successfully bridges the gap between theoretical advantages of asymmetric losses and practical optimization frameworks, providing an effective solution for learning with noisy labels that overcomes the underfitting limitations of symmetric losses.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep
neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various
robust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric
losses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict
constraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly
optimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting
ability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding
advanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging
theoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust
loss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.
However, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced
optimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and
applicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric
losses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario
and propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We
rigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE
satisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric
passive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss
framework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:

### [136] [On the Interaction of Compressibility and Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17725)
*Melih Barsbey,Antônio H. Ribeiro,Umut Şimşekli,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper analyzes the fundamental trade-off between neural network compression and adversarial robustness, showing that compressed models develop highly sensitive directions that adversaries can exploit, regardless of how compression is achieved.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks need to satisfy multiple desirable properties simultaneously - accuracy, generalization, efficiency, and robustness. While compression and robustness have been studied separately, their interaction remains poorly understood, creating a need for a unified framework to analyze how different compression methods affect adversarial robustness.

Method: The authors develop a principled theoretical framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility (neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility) affect adversarial robustness. They derive robustness bounds that reveal how compression impacts L∞ and L2 robustness through effects on learned representations, and validate their theory through empirical evaluations on synthetic and realistic tasks.

Result: The analysis shows that compression induces highly sensitive directions in representation space that adversaries can exploit. The derived robustness bounds demonstrate how neuron and spectral compressibility impact different types of robustness. Empirical evaluations confirm theoretical predictions and show that vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training, transfer learning, and contribute to universal adversarial perturbations.

Conclusion: There exists a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness in neural networks. The vulnerabilities identified arise regardless of how compression is achieved (regularization, architectural bias, or implicit dynamics). These findings suggest new pathways for designing models that balance efficiency and security.

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of
desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to
unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to
adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been
studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains
elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how
different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral
compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of
compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the
representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective
perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,
revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$
robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the
vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -
whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.
Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm
our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities
persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the
emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a
fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and
suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

### [137] [Large Learning Rates Simultaneously Achieve Robustness to Spurious Correlations and Compressibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17748)
*Melih Barsbey,Lucas Prieto,Stefanos Zafeiriou,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper shows that using large learning rates can simultaneously achieve robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility in machine learning models, while also producing beneficial representation properties like invariant features and activation sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern machine learning models need to be both robust and resource-efficient, but achieving these two desirable properties together remains challenging. The authors aim to find a simple yet effective approach to jointly optimize for robustness against spurious correlations and model compressibility.

Method: The researchers investigate the use of high learning rates as a training strategy and analyze its effects on model properties. They evaluate large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, different model architectures, and various optimizers, comparing their performance against other hyperparameters and regularization methods.

Result: Large learning rates consistently produce models with desirable properties including robustness to spurious correlations, network compressibility, invariant feature utilization, better class separation, and activation sparsity. The method performs favorably compared to other hyperparameters and regularization techniques in achieving these properties simultaneously across different experimental settings.

Conclusion: High learning rates serve as an effective facilitator for jointly achieving robustness and resource-efficiency in machine learning models. The success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is likely attributed to their ability to address hidden or rare spurious correlations present in training datasets, making them a valuable and simple training strategy.

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for
modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a
challenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for
simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network
compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce
desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,
class separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate
that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and
regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.
In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across
diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present
strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates
in standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing
hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: This paper introduces Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS) framework and Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5) to address limitations in current speech technologies that fail to capture implicit signals and contextual cues beyond explicit semantics in human communication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech technologies like ASR and TTS fail to capture beyond-semantic dimensions of human communication, including implicit signals and contextual cues that are critical for shaping meaning. There's a need to better characterize and benchmark the progression of speech intelligence toward more human-like social interaction.

Method: The authors propose a hierarchical framework called Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5) and introduce Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS) framework. They formalize BoSS using cognitive relevance theories and machine learning models to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics, evaluating BoSS-related attributes across five different dimensions.

Result: Evaluation reveals that current spoken language models (SLMs) struggle to fully interpret beyond-semantic signals. The BoSS framework successfully characterizes multidimensional features including affective cues, contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics that enhance understanding of communicative intentions and scenarios.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the significant gap in current speech technologies' ability to process beyond-semantic information and emphasize the need for advancing BoSS research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication that can better capture the full spectrum of human communicative behavior.

Abstract: Human communication involves more than explicit semantics, with implicit
signals and contextual cues playing a critical role in shaping meaning.
However, modern speech technologies, such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and Text-to-Speech (TTS) often fail to capture these beyond-semantic
dimensions. To better characterize and benchmark the progression of speech
intelligence, we introduce Spoken Interaction System Capability Levels (L1-L5),
a hierarchical framework illustrated the evolution of spoken dialogue systems
from basic command recognition to human-like social interaction. To support
these advanced capabilities, we propose Beyond-Semantic Speech (BoSS), which
refers to the set of information in speech communication that encompasses but
transcends explicit semantics. It conveys emotions, contexts, and modifies or
extends meanings through multidimensional features such as affective cues,
contextual dynamics, and implicit semantics, thereby enhancing the
understanding of communicative intentions and scenarios. We present a
formalized framework for BoSS, leveraging cognitive relevance theories and
machine learning models to analyze temporal and contextual speech dynamics. We
evaluate BoSS-related attributes across five different dimensions, reveals that
current spoken language models (SLMs) are hard to fully interpret
beyond-semantic signals. These findings highlight the need for advancing BoSS
research to enable richer, more context-aware human-machine communication.

TL;DR: This paper proposes a multimodal deep learning framework combining real-time MRI and speech signals to classify articulatory-phonological features, achieving state-of-the-art performance with contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion (F1-score of 0.81, +0.23 improvement over unimodal baseline).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate classification of articulatory-phonological features is crucial for understanding human speech production and developing robust speech technologies, especially in clinical contexts where targeted phonemic analysis can improve disease diagnosis accuracy and personalized rehabilitation therapy.

Method: The authors developed a multimodal deep learning framework that combines real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) and speech signals to classify three articulatory dimensions: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing. They evaluated four configurations: unimodal rtMRI, unimodal audio, multimodal middle fusion, and contrastive learning-based audio-vision fusion.

Result: The contrastive learning-based approach achieved state-of-the-art performance with an average F1-score of 0.81 on the USC-TIMIT dataset, representing an absolute increase of 0.23 over the unimodal baseline. The system successfully classified 15 phonological classes derived from the three articulatory dimensions.

Conclusion: The results confirm the effectiveness of contrastive representation learning for multimodal articulatory analysis, demonstrating significant improvement over unimodal approaches. The multimodal framework shows promise for clinical applications in speech therapy and disease diagnosis.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel multi-view, multitask deep learning framework combining CNN and Visual State Space Models (VSSMs) for mammography analysis that processes all four standard mammography views to jointly predict diagnostic labels and BI-RADS scores, achieving superior performance across various classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for breast cancer detection, but existing AI approaches are limited by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, reducing their clinical utility. The challenge lies in handling subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity in mammography.

Method: The framework integrates a hybrid CNN-VSSM backbone that combines convolutional encoders for local feature extraction with Visual State Space Models for capturing global contextual dependencies. It includes a gated attention-based fusion module that dynamically weights information across all four mammography views and handles missing data effectively.

Result: The hybrid model consistently outperforms baseline CNN and VSSM models across all tasks. For binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification, it achieves AUC of 0.9967 and F1 score of 0.9830. For ternary classification, F1 score reaches 0.7790, and for five-class BI-RADS classification, the best F1 score is 0.4904.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates effectiveness in mammography analysis, highlighting both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for improving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful analysis. The results show superior performance compared to baseline approaches across varying task complexities.

Abstract: Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for
effective breast cancer detection, yet it remains a complex challenge due to
subtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity. Many existing AI approaches
fall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting
their clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
multi-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four
standard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS
scores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone,
combining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual

improve robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based

handling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across
diagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models
against baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and
multi task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently
outperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task,
the shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830.
For the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of
0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.
These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework and
underscore both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for
improving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful mammography
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern medical imaging data collected across different scanners, protocols, or sites exhibit substantial heterogeneity ("batch effects" or "site effects") that obscures biological signals, reduces reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impairs the generalizability of learning-based models across datasets.

Result: The review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts, methodological advances, publicly available datasets, and current challenges in medical image harmonization, focusing on representative methods rather than an exhaustive survey, particularly highlighting MRI harmonization techniques.

Conclusion: The paper identifies major remaining challenges in the field and outlines promising avenues for future research in medical image harmonization, emphasizing the need to eliminate site-related biases while preserving meaningful biological information to improve data comparability and consistency.

Abstract: Modern medical imaging technologies have greatly advanced neuroscience
research and clinical diagnostics. However, imaging data collected across
different scanners, acquisition protocols, or imaging sites often exhibit
substantial heterogeneity, known as "batch effects" or "site effects". These
non-biological sources of variability can obscure true biological signals,
reduce reproducibility and statistical power, and severely impair the
generalizability of learning-based models across datasets. Image harmonization
aims to eliminate or mitigate such site-related biases while preserving
meaningful biological information, thereby improving data comparability and
consistency. This review provides a comprehensive overview of key concepts,
methodological advances, publicly available datasets, current challenges, and
future directions in the field of medical image harmonization, with a focus on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We systematically cover the full imaging
pipeline, and categorize harmonization approaches into prospective acquisition
and reconstruction strategies, retrospective image-level and feature-level
methods, and traveling-subject-based techniques. Rather than providing an
exhaustive survey, we focus on representative methods, with particular emphasis
on deep learning-based approaches. Finally, we summarize the major challenges

*Zhengcheng Lin,Zuobin Ying,Zhenyu Li,Zhenyu Liu,Jian Lu,Weiping Ding*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel Pixel Anchor Module is proposed for prostate cancer lesion segmentation that uses sparse feature anchors and self-attention-based Top_k selection to address semantic confusion between lesion and non-lesion areas, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 69.73% IoU and 74.32% Dice scores on the PI-CAI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and progression in prostate cancer are critical for effective treatment strategies. However, existing medical image segmentation methods struggle with semantic confusion due to high semantic homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas in prostate cancer images.

Method: The paper proposes a Pixel Anchor Module that discovers sparse feature anchors to capture global contextual information and enhance nonlinear representation capacity. It includes a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy for refining feature anchor identification and incorporates focal loss function to address class imbalance issues.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset with 69.73% IoU and 74.32% Dice scores, significantly improving prostate cancer lesion detection compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed Pixel Anchor Module effectively addresses semantic confusion in prostate cancer lesion segmentation by leveraging sparse feature anchors and attention mechanisms, demonstrating superior performance and providing a promising solution for accurate prostate cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and
progression in prostate cancer (PCa) are critical for assisting clinicians in
formulating effective treatment strategies. However, due to the high semantic
homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas, existing medical image
segmentation methods often struggle to accurately comprehend lesion semantics,
resulting in the problem of semantic confusion. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel Pixel Anchor Module, which guides the model to discover a
sparse set of feature anchors that serve to capture and interpret global
contextual information. This mechanism enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capacity and improves segmentation accuracy within lesion
regions. Moreover, we design a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy to
further refine the identification of these feature anchors, and incorporate a
focal loss function to mitigate class imbalance, thereby facilitating more
precise semantic interpretation across diverse regions. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset, demonstrating 69.73% IoU
and 74.32% Dice scores, and significantly improving prostate cancer lesion

*Zhe Xu,Ziyi Liu,Junlin Hou,Jiabo Ma,Cheng Jin,Yihui Wang,Zhixuan Chen,Zhengyu Zhang,Zhengrui Guo,Fengtao Zhou,Yingxue Xu,Xi Wang,Ronald Cheong Kin Chan,Li Liang,Hao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SmartPath-R1 is a versatile multimodal large language model that can handle both region-of-interest (ROI) and whole-slide-image (WSI) pathology tasks with enhanced reasoning capabilities, trained on 2.3M ROI and 188K WSI samples without requiring expensive chain-of-thought annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs in pathology have constrained reasoning capabilities due to reliance on expensive chain-of-thought annotations and are limited to simple visual question answering at ROI level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs including classification, detection, segmentation, and WSI analysis required in clinical practice.

Method: The framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning to leverage intrinsic MLLM knowledge without chain-of-thought supervision. It integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through a mixture-of-experts mechanism for dynamic processing across diverse pathology tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments across 72 tasks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SmartPath-R1. The model was trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI samples, demonstrating robust pathological reasoning capability for both ROI-level and WSI-level tasks.

Conclusion: SmartPath-R1 represents a significant advancement toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced AI systems for precision pathology by successfully addressing multiple diagnostic tasks simultaneously while eliminating the need for expensive chain-of-thought annotations.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
computational pathology, offering unprecedented opportunities to integrate
pathological images with language context for comprehensive diagnostic
analysis. These models hold particular promise for automating complex tasks
that traditionally require expert interpretation of pathologists. However,
current MLLM approaches in pathology demonstrate significantly constrained
reasoning capabilities, primarily due to their reliance on expensive
chain-of-thought annotations. Additionally, existing methods remain limited to
simplex application of visual question answering (VQA) at region-of-interest
(ROI) level, failing to address the full spectrum of diagnostic needs such as
ROI classification, detection, segmentation, whole-slide-image (WSI)
classification and VQA in clinical practice. In this study, we present
SmartPath-R1, a versatile MLLM capable of simultaneously addressing both
ROI-level and WSI-level tasks while demonstrating robust pathological reasoning
capability. Our framework combines scale-dependent supervised fine-tuning and
task-aware reinforcement fine-tuning, which circumvents the requirement for
chain-of-thought supervision by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge within MLLM.
Furthermore, SmartPath-R1 integrates multiscale and multitask analysis through
a mixture-of-experts mechanism, enabling dynamic processing for diverse tasks.
We curate a large-scale dataset comprising 2.3M ROI samples and 188K WSI
samples for training and evaluation. Extensive experiments across 72 tasks
validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. This work
represents a significant step toward developing versatile, reasoning-enhanced
AI systems for precision pathology.

### [144] [Mammo-Mamba: A Hybrid State-Space and Transformer Architecture with Sequential Mixture of Experts for Multi-View Mammography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17662)
*Farnoush Bayatmakou,Reza Taleei,Nicole Simone,Arash Mohammadi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Mammo-Mamba is a novel AI framework for breast cancer detection in mammograms that combines Selective State-Space Models with transformer attention and expert-driven features, achieving superior performance while being more computationally efficient than traditional Transformer-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women. While current state-of-the-art multi-view mammogram classification models use Transformer architectures, their computational complexity scales quadratically with image patches, creating a need for more efficient alternatives for accurate early detection.

Method: The authors propose Mammo-Mamba, which integrates Selective State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven feature refinement. The framework extends MambaVision backbone by introducing Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE) through customized SecMamba blocks that enable content-adaptive feature refinement in high-resolution mammographic images with dynamic expert gating.

Result: Mammo-Mamba achieves superior classification performance across all key metrics on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset while maintaining computational efficiency compared to traditional Transformer models.

Conclusion: The proposed Mammo-Mamba framework successfully addresses the computational limitations of Transformer-based mammogram classification models by providing a more efficient alternative that maintains superior performance, making it a promising solution for AI-powered breast cancer detection systems.

Abstract: Breast cancer (BC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality among women, despite recent advances in Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) systems. Accurate and efficient interpretation of multi-view mammograms
is essential for early detection, driving a surge of interest in Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered CAD models. While state-of-the-art multi-view
mammogram classification models are largely based on Transformer architectures,
their computational complexity scales quadratically with the number of image
patches, highlighting the need for more efficient alternatives. To address this
challenge, we propose Mammo-Mamba, a novel framework that integrates Selective
State-Space Models (SSMs), transformer-based attention, and expert-driven
feature refinement into a unified architecture. Mammo-Mamba extends the
MambaVision backbone by introducing the Sequential Mixture of Experts (SeqMoE)
mechanism through its customized SecMamba block. The SecMamba is a modified
MambaVision block that enhances representation learning in high-resolution
mammographic images by enabling content-adaptive feature refinement. These
blocks are integrated into the deeper stages of MambaVision, allowing the model
to progressively adjust feature emphasis through dynamic expert gating,
effectively mitigating the limitations of traditional Transformer models.
Evaluated on the CBIS-DDSM benchmark dataset, Mammo-Mamba achieves superior
classification performance across all key metrics while maintaining
computational efficiency.

### [145] [MCM: Mamba-based Cardiac Motion Tracking using Sequential Images in MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17678)
*Jiahui Yin,Xinxing Cheng,Jinming Duan,Yan Pang,Declan O'Regan,Hadrien Reynaud,Qingjie Meng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: This paper proposes MCM, a Mamba-based network for cardiac motion tracking that uses sequential CMR images to achieve smooth and temporally consistent myocardial motion estimation, outperforming existing methods that rely on single image pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cardiac motion tracking methods use single image pairs (reference + random target frame) which overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion, leading to inconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. There's a need for methods that can capture the temporal dynamics of cardiac motion more effectively.

Method: The authors develop a Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) with: (1) a bi-directional Mamba block with bi-directional scanning mechanism for plausible deformation field estimation, (2) a motion decoder that integrates motion information from adjacent frames to enhance temporal coherence, and (3) leveraging Mamba's structured state-space formulation to learn continuous myocardial dynamics from sequential images without increased computational complexity.

Result: The proposed MCM method demonstrates superior performance both quantitatively and qualitatively compared to conventional and state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods when evaluated on two public datasets. The method achieves smooth and temporally consistent motion tracking.

Conclusion: The MCM network successfully addresses the limitations of existing cardiac motion tracking methods by incorporating sequential image information and Mamba architecture, resulting in improved motion estimation that is both smooth and temporally consistent for cardiac function assessment.

Abstract: Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and
diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance
(CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing
methods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame
and a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these
methods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield
inconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a
novel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly
incorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and
temporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba
block equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates
the estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion
decoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target
frame, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking
advantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method
learns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without
increasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two
public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and
state-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods. The code is

TL;DR: Researchers created a 40+ hour manually transcribed Jamaican Patois music dataset to fine-tune ASR models like Whisper, addressing poor speech recognition performance on Patois music and improving accessibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speech recognition systems perform poorly on Jamaican Patois music, producing inaccurate captions that limit accessibility and hinder downstream applications for this widely spoken language.

Method: Data-centric approach involving curation of over 40 hours of manually transcribed Jamaican Patois music dataset, followed by fine-tuning state-of-the-art ASR models (particularly Whisper) and developing scaling laws for performance analysis.

Result: Successfully fine-tuned Whisper models on Jamaican Patois audio and established scaling laws for performance, creating an improved ASR system for Patois music recognition.

Conclusion: This work aims to positively impact the accessibility of Jamaican Patois music and advance the future of Jamaican Patois language modeling through improved speech recognition capabilities.

Abstract: Although Jamaican Patois is a widely spoken language, current speech
recognition systems perform poorly on Patois music, producing inaccurate
captions that limit accessibility and hinder downstream applications. In this
work, we take a data-centric approach to this problem by curating more than 40
hours of manually transcribed Patois music. We use this dataset to fine-tune
state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, and use the results
to develop scaling laws for the performance of Whisper models on Jamaican

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper presents a large-scale empirical study comparing different combinations of speech-to-text, large language models, and text-to-speech components in voice-based conversational AI systems using data from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic evaluation of different component combinations in cascaded voice-based conversational AI architectures (STT + LLM + TTS) in production settings remains understudied, despite their increasing adoption.

Method: Developed an automated evaluation framework using LLM-as-a-Judge to assess conversational quality, technical accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities across four production configurations using data from over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews.

Result: Google STT paired with GPT-4.1 significantly outperformed alternatives in both conversational and technical quality metrics. However, objective quality metrics showed weak correlation with user satisfaction scores, indicating that user experience depends on factors beyond technical performance.

Conclusion: The study provides practical guidance for selecting components in multimodal conversational AI systems and contributes a validated evaluation methodology for voice-based interactions, revealing that technical performance alone doesn't guarantee user satisfaction.

Abstract: Voice-based conversational AI systems increasingly rely on cascaded
architectures combining speech-to-text (STT), large language models (LLMs), and
text-to-speech (TTS) components. However, systematic evaluation of different
component combinations in production settings remains understudied. We present
a large-scale empirical comparison of STT x LLM x TTS stacks using data from
over 300,000 AI-conducted job interviews. We develop an automated evaluation
framework using LLM-as-a-Judge to assess conversational quality, technical
accuracy, and skill assessment capabilities. Our analysis of four production
configurations reveals that Google STT paired with GPT-4.1 significantly
outperforms alternatives in both conversational and technical quality metrics.
Surprisingly, we find that objective quality metrics correlate weakly with user
satisfaction scores, suggesting that user experience in voice-based AI systems
depends on factors beyond technical performance. Our findings provide practical
guidance for selecting components in multimodal conversational AI systems and
contribute a validated evaluation methodology for voice-based interactions.

### [148] [Segmentation-free Goodness of Pronunciation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16838)
*Xinwei Cao,Zijian Fan,Torbjørn Svendsen,Giampiero Salvi*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: This paper proposes new alignment-free methods (GOP-SA and GOP-AF) for mispronunciation detection that work with CTC-based acoustic models, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation and achieving state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional mispronunciation detection systems rely on goodness of pronunciation (GOP) methods that require pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic units, which limits accuracy and prevents the use of modern CTC-based acoustic models for pronunciation evaluation.

Method: The authors propose two methods: (1) self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables CTC-trained ASR models for MDD, and (2) a more general alignment-free method (GOP-AF) that considers all possible alignments of the target phoneme. They provide theoretical foundations, numerical stability solutions, and proper normalization techniques.

Result: Extensive experiments on CMU Kids and Speechocean762 datasets show that the proposed GOP-AF method achieves state-of-the-art results on phoneme-level pronunciation assessment. The method's performance depends on acoustic model peakiness and context around target phonemes.

Conclusion: The proposed alignment-free GOP methods successfully eliminate the need for pre-segmentation while enabling the use of modern CTC-based models, leading to improved accuracy in mispronunciation detection and achieving state-of-the-art performance in phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a significant part in
modern computer aided language learning (CALL) systems. Within MDD,
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment is key to helping L2 learners improve
their pronunciation. However, most systems are based on a form of goodness of
pronunciation (GOP) which requires pre-segmentation of speech into phonetic
units. This limits the accuracy of these methods and the possibility to use
modern CTC-based acoustic models for their evaluation. In this study, we first
propose self-alignment GOP (GOP-SA) that enables the use of CTC-trained ASR
models for MDD. Next, we define a more general alignment-free method that takes
all possible alignments of the target phoneme into account (GOP-AF). We give a
theoretical account of our definition of GOP-AF, an implementation that solves
potential numerical issues as well as a proper normalization which makes the
method applicable with acoustic models with different peakiness over time. We
provide extensive experimental results on the CMU Kids and Speechocean762
datasets comparing the different definitions of our methods, estimating the
dependency of GOP-AF on the peakiness of the acoustic models and on the amount
of context around the target phoneme. Finally, we compare our methods with
recent studies over the Speechocean762 data showing that the feature vectors
derived from the proposed method achieve state-of-the-art results on
phoneme-level pronunciation assessment.

Main category: q-bio.QM

TL;DR: The paper introduces IGNITE, a comprehensive multi-stain dataset of annotated NSCLC whole-slide images for developing computational pathology algorithms, featuring 887 annotated regions from 155 patients across tissue segmentation, nuclei detection, and PD-L1 detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current digital pathology datasets for NSCLC are limited in scope, lack annotations of metastatic sites, and miss molecular information like PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. There's a need for comprehensive datasets to support biomarker development and computational quantification of tumor immune microenvironment characteristics for immunotherapy response prediction.

Method: Creation of the IGNITE data toolkit - a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset with manual annotations across three complementary tasks: (1) multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E slides with 16 classes including primary and metastatic NSCLC, (2) nuclei detection, and (3) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides.

Result: Public release of 887 fully annotated regions of interest from 155 unique patients. This represents the first public NSCLC dataset with manual annotations of H&E in metastatic sites and PD-L1 IHC, providing a comprehensive resource for developing cell detection and tissue segmentation algorithms in computational pathology.

Conclusion: The IGNITE dataset fills a critical gap in available NSCLC digital pathology resources by providing the first comprehensive, publicly available dataset with annotations for metastatic sites and molecular markers, enabling better development of computational tools for tumor immune microenvironment analysis and immunotherapy biomarker development.

Abstract: The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) histopathology contains morphological and molecular characteristics
predictive of immunotherapy response. Computational quantification of TIME
characteristics, such as cell detection and tissue segmentation, can support
biomarker development. However, currently available digital pathology datasets
of NSCLC for the development of cell detection or tissue segmentation
algorithms are limited in scope, lack annotations of clinically prevalent
metastatic sites, and forgo molecular information such as PD-L1
immunohistochemistry (IHC). To fill this gap, we introduce the IGNITE data
toolkit, a multi-stain, multi-centric, and multi-scanner dataset of annotated
NSCLC whole-slide images. We publicly release 887 fully annotated regions of
interest from 155 unique patients across three complementary tasks: (i)
multi-class semantic segmentation of tissue compartments in H&E-stained slides,
with 16 classes spanning primary and metastatic NSCLC, (ii) nuclei detection,
and (iii) PD-L1 positive tumor cell detection in PD-L1 IHC slides. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first public NSCLC dataset with manual
annotations of H&E in metastatic sites and PD-L1 IHC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the disaster informatics field evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic period and identify emerging trends, collaboration patterns, and shifts in research priorities that could inform future disaster preparedness and response strategies.

Method: Bibliometric and topic analysis using a large-scale literature corpus from January 2020 to September 2022, employing pre-trained language models and generative AI for data collection, quality assurance, topic extraction, summarization, and visualization of collaboration networks and research trends.

and (5) the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced research priorities in disaster
informatics, placing greater emphasis on public health. We further demonstrate
that the field is converging on multidimensional resilience strategies and
cross-sectoral data-sharing collaborations or projects, reflecting a heightened
awareness of global vulnerability and interdependency. Collecting and quality
assurance strategies, data analytic practices, LLM-based topic extraction and
summarization approaches, and result visualization tools can be applied to

### [151] [Weak Links in LinkedIn: Enhancing Fake Profile Detection in the Age of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16860)
*Apoorva Gulati,Rajesh Kumar,Vinti Agarwal,Aditya Sharma*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: This study reveals that existing fake profile detectors are vulnerable to LLM-generated profiles, achieving only 48-58% accuracy compared to 93-94% on manual fakes. The authors propose GPT-assisted adversarial training to restore detector robustness to 93-99% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Language Models have made it easier to create realistic fake profiles on platforms like LinkedIn, posing significant risks to existing text-based fake profile detection systems that were designed primarily for manually created fake profiles.

Method: The researchers evaluated existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles and proposed GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure. They conducted ablation studies comparing different embedding approaches (numerical, textual, and combined) and performed complementary analysis using GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators.

Result: Existing detectors showed high effectiveness against manual fakes (6-7% False Accept Rate) but failed against GPT-generated profiles (42-52% False Accept Rate). GPT-assisted adversarial training restored performance to 1-7% False Accept Rate while maintaining low False Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Combined numerical and textual embeddings showed highest robustness, followed by numerical-only, then textual-only embeddings.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that current fake profile detectors are inadequate against LLM-generated profiles and establishes that GPT-assisted adversarial training effectively restores detector robustness. The research affirms the critical need for automated detection systems that can handle sophisticated AI-generated fake profiles.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it easier to create realistic fake
profiles on platforms like LinkedIn. This poses a significant risk for
text-based fake profile detectors. In this study, we evaluate the robustness of
existing detectors against LLM-generated profiles. While highly effective in
detecting manually created fake profiles (False Accept Rate: 6-7%), the
existing detectors fail to identify GPT-generated profiles (False Accept Rate:
42-52%). We propose GPT-assisted adversarial training as a countermeasure,
restoring the False Accept Rate to between 1-7% without impacting the False
Reject Rates (0.5-2%). Ablation studies revealed that detectors trained on
combined numerical and textual embeddings exhibit the highest robustness,
followed by those using numerical-only embeddings, and lastly those using
textual-only embeddings. Complementary analysis on the ability of prompt-based
GPT-4Turbo and human evaluators affirms the need for robust automated detectors
such as the one proposed in this study.

### [152] [Tab-MIA: A Benchmark Dataset for Membership Inference Attacks on Tabular Data in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17259)
*Eyal German,Sagiv Antebi,Daniel Samira,Asaf Shabtai,Yuval Elovici*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: This paper introduces Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset for evaluating membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models trained with tabular data, revealing that LLMs are highly vulnerable to privacy attacks when processing structured data across different encoding formats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are increasingly trained on tabular data containing personally identifiable information (PII) in structured formats, creating privacy risks through data extraction and membership inference attacks. Existing MIA methods focus on textual content, but their effectiveness on structured data with limited content, diverse data types, and column-level semantics remains unclear.

Method: The authors developed Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset comprising five data collections represented in six different encoding formats. They conducted the first systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs fine-tuned with tabular data, analyzing memorization behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables across multiple encoding formats.

Result: LLMs memorize tabular data differently across encoding formats and are highly susceptible to membership inference attacks. Models fine-tuned for as few as three epochs show high vulnerability with AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases, demonstrating significant privacy risks when processing structured data.

Conclusion: Tab-MIA provides a systematic framework for evaluating privacy risks in LLMs trained on tabular data and serves as a foundation for developing privacy-preserving methods. The benchmark reveals that current LLMs pose significant privacy threats when handling structured data, highlighting the need for better protection mechanisms.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on tabular data, which,
unlike unstructured text, often contains personally identifiable information
(PII) in a highly structured and explicit format. As a result, privacy risks
arise, since sensitive records can be inadvertently retained by the model and
exposed through data extraction or membership inference attacks (MIAs). While
existing MIA methods primarily target textual content, their efficacy and
threat implications may differ when applied to structured data, due to its
limited content, diverse data types, unique value distributions, and
column-level semantics. In this paper, we present Tab-MIA, a benchmark dataset
for evaluating MIAs on tabular data in LLMs and demonstrate how it can be used.
Tab-MIA comprises five data collections, each represented in six different
encoding formats. Using our Tab-MIA benchmark, we conduct the first evaluation
of state-of-the-art MIA methods on LLMs finetuned with tabular data across
multiple encoding formats. In the evaluation, we analyze the memorization
behavior of pretrained LLMs on structured data derived from Wikipedia tables.
Our findings show that LLMs memorize tabular data in ways that vary across
encoding formats, making them susceptible to extraction via MIAs. Even when
fine-tuned for as few as three epochs, models exhibit high vulnerability, with
AUROC scores approaching 90% in most cases. Tab-MIA enables systematic
evaluation of these risks and provides a foundation for developing
privacy-preserving methods for tabular data in LLMs.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: This survey systematically reviews controllable video generation methods that extend beyond text-to-video generation by incorporating additional non-textual conditions (camera motion, depth maps, human pose) to enable more precise user control over AI-generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video foundation models are limited by text prompts alone, which are insufficient to express complex, multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements, making it challenging for users to generate videos with precise control over the output.

Method: The paper provides a systematic survey approach that covers: (1) introducing key concepts and open-source video generation models, (2) analyzing control mechanisms in video diffusion models and how different conditions are incorporated into the denoising process, and (3) categorizing existing methods by control signal types including single-condition, multi-condition, and universal controllable generation.

Result: The survey presents a comprehensive categorization and analysis of controllable video generation methods, providing both theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field, with a curated repository of literature available for reference.

Conclusion: The integration of additional non-textual conditions into pretrained video generation models successfully enhances the flexibility and practical applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems, addressing the limitations of text-only control and enabling more precise user control over video synthesis.

Abstract: With the rapid development of AI-generated content (AIGC), video generation
has emerged as one of its most dynamic and impactful subfields. In particular,
the advancement of video generation foundation models has led to growing demand
for controllable video generation methods that can more accurately reflect user
intent. Most existing foundation models are designed for text-to-video
generation, where text prompts alone are often insufficient to express complex,
multi-modal, and fine-grained user requirements. This limitation makes it
challenging for users to generate videos with precise control using current
models. To address this issue, recent research has explored the integration of
additional non-textual conditions, such as camera motion, depth maps, and human
pose, to extend pretrained video generation models and enable more controllable
video synthesis. These approaches aim to enhance the flexibility and practical
applicability of AIGC-driven video generation systems. In this survey, we
provide a systematic review of controllable video generation, covering both
theoretical foundations and recent advances in the field. We begin by
introducing the key concepts and commonly used open-source video generation
models. We then focus on control mechanisms in video diffusion models,
analyzing how different types of conditions can be incorporated into the
denoising process to guide generation. Finally, we categorize existing methods
based on the types of control signals they leverage, including single-condition
generation, multi-condition generation, and universal controllable generation.

Method: Built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with elimination of MLPs in deformable 3DGS, relying solely on geometry for faster facial expression adaptation. Introduces a simplification strategy based on primary points to distribute point clouds sparsely across facial surfaces, optimizing point numbers while maintaining rendering quality.

Result: Achieves exceptionally fast on-the-fly training that enables synchronous recording and reconstruction of head avatars from live video streams. The method successfully maintains rendering quality while optimizing computational efficiency and can be directly applied to animation, toonify, and relighting applications.

Conclusion: StreamME successfully demonstrates fast 3D avatar reconstruction through on-the-fly training, offering practical benefits for VR systems and online conferences by protecting facial privacy, reducing bandwidth, and enabling real-time avatar generation without requiring pre-cached data.

Abstract: We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The
StreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video
streams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the
reconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast
training strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our
approach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating
the reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which
significantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further
ensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification
strategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more
sparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining
rendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method
protects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or
online conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream
application such as animation, toonify, and relighting. Please refer to our

*Kayhan Latifzadeh,Luis A. Leiva,Klen Čopič Pucihar,Matjaž Kljun,Iztok Devetak,Lili Steblovnik*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Researchers used eye and head tracking to assess clinical skills in simulated baby delivery training, finding that these biometric measures can effectively distinguish between trained and untrained practitioners with high accuracy (F1 scores of 0.77-0.85).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop objective, computational methods for skill assessment in clinical training settings as an alternative or complement to traditional subjective evaluation methods, addressing the need for more precise and automated skill evaluation in medical education.

Method: Analyzed eye and head movements of 24 practitioners during simulated baby delivery training sessions using eye-tracking glasses. Calculated key biometric metrics including pupillary response rate, fixation duration, and angular velocity to differentiate skill levels.

Result: Head-related features achieved F1 score of 0.85 and AUC of 0.86, while pupil-related features achieved F1 score of 0.77 and AUC of 0.85. The tracking system successfully differentiated between trained and untrained practitioners, particularly during labor tasks.

Conclusion: Eye and head tracking using commodity eye-tracking glasses can serve as an effective complementary tool for implicit skill assessment in clinical training, providing objective metrics that support computational models for evaluating practitioner competency in medical procedures.

Abstract: We examined eye and head movements to gain insights into skill development in
clinical settings. A total of 24 practitioners participated in simulated baby
delivery training sessions. We calculated key metrics, including pupillary
response rate, fixation duration, or angular velocity. Our findings indicate
that eye and head tracking can effectively differentiate between trained and
untrained practitioners, particularly during labor tasks. For example,
head-related features achieved an F1 score of 0.85 and AUC of 0.86, whereas
pupil-related features achieved F1 score of 0.77 and AUC of 0.85. The results
lay the groundwork for computational models that support implicit skill
assessment and training in clinical settings by using commodity eye-tracking
glasses as a complementary device to more traditional evaluation methods such
as subjective scores.

### [156] [Explainable AI for Collaborative Assessment of 2D/3D Registration Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17597)
*Sue Min Cho,Alexander Do,Russell H. Taylor,Mathias Unberath*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: This paper presents the first AI framework for verifying 2D/3D registration quality in surgical navigation, enhanced with explainability features to help human operators detect registration errors that could lead to surgical complications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current visualization-based methods are insufficient for humans to reliably detect 2D/3D registration misalignments in surgical navigation systems. Since even small misalignments can cause revision surgery or irreversible errors, there's a critical need for robust quality assurance as surgery becomes increasingly digitized with AI and robotics.

Method: The authors developed an explainable AI (XAI) framework specifically trained for 2D/3D registration quality verification. They conducted systematic evaluations comparing four conditions: AI-only, human-only, human-AI, and human-XAI through both algorithm-centric and human-centered assessments.

Result: The explainability features modestly improved user trust and willingness to override AI errors, but did not exceed standalone AI performance in aggregate. The human-XAI collaboration showed promise but didn't achieve superior overall performance compared to AI alone.

Conclusion: While the current XAI approach shows modest improvements in trust and error correction willingness, it doesn't surpass standalone AI performance. However, future developments in both algorithmic design and human-XAI collaboration elements show promise for achieving more robust quality assurance in 2D/3D registration systems.

Abstract: As surgery embraces digital transformation--integrating sophisticated
imaging, advanced algorithms, and robotics to support and automate complex
sub-tasks--human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for
patient safety. This shift introduces new "operator-type" roles tasked with
verifying complex algorithmic outputs, particularly at critical junctures of
the procedure, such as the intermediary check before drilling or implant
placement. A prime example is 2D/3D registration, a key enabler of image-based
surgical navigation that aligns intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D
data. Although registration algorithms have advanced significantly, they
occasionally yield inaccurate results. Because even small misalignments can
lead to revision surgery or irreversible surgical errors, there is a critical
need for robust quality assurance. Current visualization-based strategies alone
have been found insufficient to enable humans to reliably detect 2D/3D
registration misalignments. In response, we propose the first artificial
intelligence (AI) framework trained specifically for 2D/3D registration quality
verification, augmented by explainability features that clarify the model's
decision-making. Our explainable AI (XAI) approach aims to enhance informed
decision-making for human operators by providing a second opinion together with
a rationale behind it. Through algorithm-centric and human-centered
evaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only,
human-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features
modestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not
exceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work
extending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements
holds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.

### [157] [A Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16826)
*Qikai Wei,Huansheng Ning,Chunlong Han,Jianguo Ding*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: This paper proposes QMKGF, a query-aware multi-path knowledge graph fusion approach that enhances Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by constructing knowledge graphs from retrieved documents and using multi-path subgraph strategies to improve semantic relevance between queries and retrieved content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG systems focus on retrieving isolated document segments using similarity-based matching while ignoring intrinsic connections between them, which limits performance in RAG tasks that require understanding relationships and context.

Method: The approach uses LLMs to extract entities and relations to build knowledge graphs, implements a multi-path subgraph construction strategy (one-hop, multi-hop, and importance-based relations), applies a query-aware attention reward model to score subgraph triples, and enriches the final subgraph with semantically relevant triples to expand the original query.

Result: QMKGF achieved a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98% on HotpotQA dataset, outperforming BGE-Rerank by 9.72 percentage points (55.26% to 64.98%). The method was evaluated on SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements.

Conclusion: The QMKGF approach effectively addresses limitations of existing RAG systems by leveraging knowledge graph structures and multi-path reasoning, significantly improving the semantic relevance and quality of generated content in retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gradually emerged as a promising
paradigm for enhancing the accuracy and factual consistency of content
generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing RAG studies
primarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching
methods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This
limitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF,
a Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing
Retrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ
general-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a
knowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a
multi-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations,
multi-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the
semantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query.
Subsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores
subgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query. Then, we
select the highest score subgraph and enrich subgraph with additional triples
from other subgraphs that are highly semantically relevant to the query.
Finally, the entities, relations, and triples within the updated subgraph are
utilised to expand the original query, thereby enhancing its semantic
representation and improving the quality of LLMs' generation. We evaluate QMKGF
on the SQuAD, IIRC, Culture, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue datasets. On the HotpotQA
dataset, our method achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 64.98\%, surpassing the
BGE-Rerank approach by 9.72 percentage points (from 55.26\% to 64.98\%).
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the QMKGF
approach.

### [158] [VL-CLIP: Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations via Visual Grounding and LLM-Augmented CLIP Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17080)
*Ramin Giahi,Kehui Yao,Sriram Kollipara,Kai Zhao,Vahid Mirjalili,Jianpeng Xu,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: VL-CLIP enhances CLIP for e-commerce recommendations by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and LLM-based agents for enriched text embeddings, achieving significant improvements in CTR (18.6%), ATC (15.5%), and GMV (4.0%) on a major US e-commerce platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language models like CLIP face three key challenges in e-commerce: 1) weak object-level alignment where global image embeddings miss fine-grained product attributes, 2) ambiguous textual representations from unclear product descriptions, and 3) domain mismatch as generic models don't generalize well to e-commerce-specific data.

Method: The VL-CLIP framework enhances CLIP embeddings through two components: Visual Grounding that refines image representations by localizing key products for fine-grained visual understanding, and an LLM-based agent that generates enriched text embeddings by disambiguating product descriptions to improve cross-modal matching.

Result: VL-CLIP achieved substantial performance improvements on a major US e-commerce platform with tens of millions of items: 18.6% increase in CTR, 15.5% increase in ATC, and 4.0% increase in GMV. The framework also outperformed existing vision-language models including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL in both precision and semantic alignment metrics.

Conclusion: The combination of object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation demonstrates significant potential for robust multimodal recommendations in e-commerce, successfully addressing the limitations of generic vision-language models and improving both retrieval accuracy and recommendation quality at scale.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation
platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding.
However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in
e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global
image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to
suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where
product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal
matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not
generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we
propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating
Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent
for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image
representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances
textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach
significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness,
and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the
largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by
15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework
outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in
both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining
object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust
multimodal recommendations.
