### [1] [Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13827)
*Ashish Kattamuri,Ishita Prasad,Meetu Malhotra,Arpita Vats,Rahul Raja,Albert Lie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new framework combining Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multilingual contrastive reward signals improves Text-to-SQL performance in cross-lingual scenarios, enhancing both execution and semantic accuracy without large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Text-to-SQL methods focus only on executable queries and overlook semantic alignment challenges. Performance drops significantly when moving from English to other languages (average 6 percentage points decline).

Method: Combines GRPO with multilingual contrastive reward signals to enhance task efficiency and semantic accuracy. Uses semantic similarity-based rewards to improve SQL generation and user intent correspondence.

Result: On MultiSpider dataset, GRPO improved execution accuracy to 87.4% (+26 pp over zero-shot) and semantic accuracy to 52.29% (+32.86 pp). Contrastive reward further boosted average semantic accuracy to 59.14% (+6.85 pp). A 3B LLaMA model with contrastive rewards outperformed zero-shot 8B model by 7.43 pp in execution accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework enables significant Text-to-SQL performance improvements with contrastive rewards for semantic alignment, achieving strong results with only 3,000 RL training examples without requiring large-scale datasets.

Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable
queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the
semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results.
Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English
to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across
non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new
framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a
multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and
semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method
teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user
intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the
seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO
improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and
semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive
reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic
accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our
experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model
fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger
zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from
81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly
matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using
just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate
how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive
rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training
datasets.

### [2] [From Explainability to Action: A Generative Operational Framework for Integrating XAI in Clinical Mental Health Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13828)
*Ratna Kandala,Akshata Kishore Moharir,Divya Arvinda Nayak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a Generative Operational Framework using LLMs to translate technical XAI outputs into clinically actionable narratives for mental health screening, addressing the lab-to-clinic gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current XAI techniques like SHAP and LIME produce technically faithful outputs but fail to deliver clinically relevant insights that clinicians can use or patients can understand, creating a barrier to real-world adoption in mental health screening.

Method: The Generative Operational Framework leverages Large Language Models as a central translation engine that ingests raw technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesizes them with clinical guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed clinical narratives.

Result: The framework directly addresses key operational barriers including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and stakeholder-specific communication, moving beyond isolated data points toward integrated, actionable AI.

Conclusion: This approach provides a strategic roadmap for delivering trustworthy AI in clinical practice by bridging the gap between technical transparency and human utility through generative XAI.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been presented as the critical
component for unlocking the potential of machine learning in mental health
screening (MHS). However, a persistent lab-to-clinic gap remains. Current XAI
techniques, such as SHAP and LIME, excel at producing technically faithful
outputs such as feature importance scores, but fail to deliver clinically
relevant, actionable insights that can be used by clinicians or understood by
patients. This disconnect between technical transparency and human utility is
the primary barrier to real-world adoption. This paper argues that this gap is
a translation problem and proposes the Generative Operational Framework, a
novel system architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a
central translation engine. This framework is designed to ingest the raw,
technical outputs from diverse XAI tools and synthesize them with clinical
guidelines (via RAG) to automatically generate human-readable, evidence-backed
clinical narratives. To justify our solution, we provide a systematic analysis
of the components it integrates, tracing the evolution from intrinsic models to
generative XAI. We demonstrate how this framework directly addresses key
operational barriers, including workflow integration, bias mitigation, and
stakeholder-specific communication. This paper also provides a strategic
roadmap for moving the field beyond the generation of isolated data points
toward the delivery of integrated, actionable, and trustworthy AI in clinical
practice.

### [3] [A Linguistics-Aware LLM Watermarking via Syntactic Predictability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13829)
*Shinwoo Park,Hyejin Park,Hyeseon Ahn,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STELA is a publicly verifiable watermarking framework for LLMs that dynamically adjusts watermark strength based on linguistic indeterminacy using POS n-grams, achieving better detection robustness without requiring model logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current watermarking methods face a trade-off between text quality and detection robustness, and their reliance on model-specific signals prevents public verification since detectors need access to model logits.

Method: STELA modulates watermark strength using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled linguistic indeterminacy - weakening signals in grammatically constrained contexts to preserve quality and strengthening them in linguistically flexible contexts to enhance detectability.

Result: Extensive experiments across typologically diverse languages (English, Chinese, Korean) show STELA surpasses prior methods in detection robustness while enabling publicly verifiable detection without model logits.

Conclusion: STELA provides an effective solution for publicly verifiable watermarking that balances text quality and detection robustness by leveraging linguistic degrees of freedom, advancing trustworthy AI governance.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable
governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is
particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central
challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent
studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model
output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on
these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public
verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the
underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark
strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA
dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled
linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to
preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic
flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to
any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through
extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English,
isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior
methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at

### [4] [Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13830)
*Zhongze Cai,Xiaocheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a method to collect pairwise preference data from user annotations by using responses from different models, then filters data quality through user behavior modeling and EM algorithm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pairwise preference data collection relies on professional annotators, but user annotations from daily interactions offer better expertise for their own queries, though with quality control challenges.

Method: Generate two responses from different models/versions, use asymmetry to infer user data quality through a user behavior model, and apply expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate latent user quality factors for filtering.

Result: The approach effectively captures user behavior and enables successful data filtering for LLM alignment in downstream tasks.

Conclusion: User annotation from comparison mode with quality filtering through behavioral modeling provides an effective alternative to professional annotation for collecting pairwise preference data.

Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of
large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt,
two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of
the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional
human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect
pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the
increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are
contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily
interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the
best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the
downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we
consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or
two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an
inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model.
We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality
factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The
downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the
user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

### [5] [Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831)
*Chao Han,Yijuan Liang,Zihao Xuan,Daokuan Wu,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Informed routing improves LLM efficiency by proactively assessing token importance and recoverability, enabling execute-or-approximate decisions instead of greedy execute-or-skip routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High inference costs limit LLM deployment, and existing dynamic token-level computation methods suffer from greedy routing that causes irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection.

Method: Proposes Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF) - a small predictive module that estimates unit outputs before routing decisions, enabling execute-or-approximate policy that preserves model fidelity while reducing computation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across multiple sparsity levels, matches or surpasses strong baselines without final LoRA fine-tuning, and reduces training time by over 50%.

Conclusion: Informed routing with LFF provides a superior paradigm for dynamic computation allocation in LLMs, offering better efficiency while maintaining model performance.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is
increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in
dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by
selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on
greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to
irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper
introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these
issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance
but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be
approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF),
a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing
decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that
preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive
experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed
routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across
multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our
method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all
while reducing training time by over 50%. The code is available at:

### [6] [Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13832)
*Minsik Choi,Hyegang Son,Changhoon Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces HIES (Head Importance-Entropy Score), a new pruning criterion that combines head importance scores with attention entropy to better identify redundant attention heads in Transformers, achieving improved model quality and stability compared to HIS-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models face efficiency challenges due to their multiple layers and attention heads. While gradient-based pruning methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) are popular, they have limitations as they only capture gradient-driven contributions and overlook attention pattern diversity.

Method: Proposed HIES (Head Importance-Entropy Score) that integrates head importance scores with attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution for more effective pruning.

Result: HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial model compression without sacrificing accuracy or stability.

Conclusion: HIES provides a more comprehensive pruning criterion that effectively addresses the limitations of HIS-only methods, achieving better performance and stability in Transformer model compression.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks.
However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention
heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address
these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably,
gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction
for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads.
However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven
contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head
Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with
attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution.
Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality
and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial
model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will
be released upon publication.

### [7] [ConDABench: Interactive Evaluation of Language Models for Data Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13835)
*Avik Dutta,Priyanshu Gupta,Hosein Hasanbeig,Rahul Pratap Singh,Harshit Nigam,Sumit Gulwani,Arjun Radhakrishna,Gustavo Soares,Ashish Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConDABench is a framework for generating conversational data analysis benchmarks and evaluating tools on them, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks that lack interactivity and real-world complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data analysis involves under-specified goals and unclean data requiring user interaction, but existing LLM benchmarks don't capture these complexities or support interactivity.

Method: Multi-agent workflow generates realistic benchmarks from articles about insights from public datasets, creating 1,420 conversational data analysis problems with an evaluation harness for systematic tool assessment.

Result: Evaluation shows newer LLMs solve more instances but aren't necessarily better at tasks requiring sustained, long-form engagement.

Conclusion: ConDABench enables measuring progress toward truly collaborative models that can complete complex interactive data analysis tasks.

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and
unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a
user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing
benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these
complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce
ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA)
benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench
consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from
articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA
problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for
the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational
data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of
state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation
of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better
at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an
avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative
models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

### [8] [SIMBA UQ: Similarity-Based Aggregation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13836)
*Debarun Bhattacharjya,Balaji Ganesan,Junkyu Lee,Radu Marinescu,Katsiaryna Mirylenka,Michael Glass,Xiao Shou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates black-box uncertainty quantification methods for LLMs, proposing a similarity-based framework that uses consistency between generated outputs as a proxy for confidence, and shows it outperforms baselines on question answering, summarization, and text-to-SQL tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs need uncertainty quantification to measure confidence in their outputs for trusted AI systems. Black-box methods are preferred due to robustness, adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and computational tractability.

Method: Proposes a non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that uses consistency between generated outputs as confidence proxy. Introduces novel techniques training confidence estimation models with small training sets.

Result: Empirical study across question answering, summarization, and text-to-SQL tasks shows proposed similarity-based methods yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

Conclusion: Similarity-based black-box uncertainty quantification methods can effectively estimate LLM confidence and outperform existing approaches across diverse generative tasks.

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know?
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an
estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore
increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box
UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the
generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as
robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and
computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of
UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where
the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is
used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level
non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad
swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as
introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence
estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with
datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and
text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can
yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

### [9] [Seeing Hate Differently: Hate Subspace Modeling for Culture-Aware Hate Speech Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13837)
*Weibin Cai,Reza Zafarani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A culture-aware hate speech detection framework that addresses biased training labels and varying cultural interpretations by modeling cultural attribute combinations and using label propagation to create individual hate subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hate speech detection methods overlook real-world complexities like biased training labels and varying cultural interpretations of hate, leading to challenges with data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling.

Method: Proposed a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate subspaces by modeling combinations of cultural attributes and using label propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination, addressing data sparsity and cultural entanglement.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 1.05% on average across all metrics in experiments.

Conclusion: The culture-aware framework effectively addresses challenges in hate speech detection by considering cultural variations and individual perspectives, leading to improved classification performance.

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods
often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and
interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with
different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including
data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them,
we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate
subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural
attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label
propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally,
individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification
performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\%
on average across all metrics.

### [10] [Meronymic Ontology Extraction via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13839)
*Dekai Zhang,Simone Conia,Antonio Rago*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents a fully-automated method using large language models (LLMs) to extract product ontologies from raw review texts, outperforming existing BERT-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ontology construction is time-consuming and expensive, while ontologies are essential for organizing unstructured text data in domains like e-commerce where proper product organization is needed.

Method: Developed a fully-automated method that harnesses recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to extract product ontologies in the form of meronymies from raw review texts.

Result: The ontologies produced by the LLM-based method surpass an existing BERT-based baseline when evaluated using an LLM-as-a-judge approach.

Conclusion: The investigation provides groundwork for using LLMs more generally in ontology extraction, both for product ontologies and potentially other domains.

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of
organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing
formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and
application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product
listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual
construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious
process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language
models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product
ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate
that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based
baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides
the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise)
ontology extraction.

### [11] [ADMIT: Few-shot Knowledge Poisoning Attacks on RAG-based Fact Checking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13842)
*Yutao Wu,Xiao Liu,Yinghui Li,Yifeng Gao,Yifan Ding,Jiale Ding,Xiang Zheng,Xingjun Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ADMIT is a knowledge poisoning attack that manipulates RAG-based fact-checking systems to produce attacker-controlled outputs by injecting adversarial content, achieving high success rates across multiple models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate real-world fact-checking vulnerabilities where credible evidence dominates retrieval, extending knowledge poisoning to scenarios with authentic supporting/refuting evidence.

Method: ADMIT is a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions without requiring access to target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control.

Result: Achieves 86% average attack success rate at extremely low poisoning rate (0.93×10^-6), transfers across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 benchmarks, outperforming prior attacks by 11.2%.

Conclusion: Exposes significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems, demonstrating robustness even against strong counter-evidence.

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking
Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs
grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to
misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking
scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the
retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to
the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic
supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT}
(\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a
few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking
decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the
target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show
that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4
cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\%
at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining
robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior
state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings,
exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking
systems.

### [12] [Serialized EHR make for good text representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13843)
*Zhirong Chou,Quan Qin,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SerialBEHRT extends SciBERT through additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences to better capture temporal dependencies in healthcare data, achieving superior performance on antibiotic susceptibility prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing foundation models struggle to reconcile the tabular and event-based nature of Electronic Health Records with the sequential priors of natural language models, limiting their ability to capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters.

Method: SerialBEHRT extends SciBERT through additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences, designed to encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events.

Result: SerialBEHRT achieves superior and more consistent performance compared to state-of-the-art EHR representation strategies on antibiotic susceptibility prediction.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare applications.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for
learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet,
existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based
nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of
natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to
capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce
SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through
additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to
encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby
producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the
task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem
in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the
art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves
superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of
temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

### [13] [DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13847)
*Jinbin Zhang,Nasib Ullah,Erik Schultheis,Rohit Babbar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DynaSpec introduces a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism for speculative decoding that uses lightweight meta-classifiers to route contexts to token clusters, speeding up drafting while maintaining verification accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed vocabulary subsets in speculative decoding are brittle and suppress rare tokens, creating a latency bottleneck as LLM vocabularies scale. Current methods require retuning and don't generalize well across tasks.

Method: Uses lightweight meta-classifiers that route contexts to token clusters in parallel with draft encoding. The union of top-k selected clusters forms the drafter's shortlist while verification uses the full vocabulary.

Result: Consistent gains in mean accepted length over fixed-shortlist baselines, enabling smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: DynaSpec provides a robust, context-aware approach to speculative decoding that generalizes well and improves performance without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way
to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a
large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling
of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially.
While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely
unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a
latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g.,
FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the
target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency.
Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency
lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static
shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected
number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a
context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up
drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce
lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small
number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the
drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and
exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the
drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft
encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard
speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted
length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection
enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

### [14] [On-device System of Compositional Multi-tasking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13848)
*Ondrej Bohdal,Konstantinos Theodosiadis,Asterios Mpatziakas,Dimitris Filippidis,Iro Spyrou,Christos Zonios,Anastasios Drosou,Dimosthenis Ioannidis,Kyeng-Hun Lee,Jijoong Moon,Hyeonmok Ko,Mete Ozay,Umberto Michieli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel approach for compositional multi-tasking (summarization + translation) using learnable projection layers on combined LoRA adapters, enabling efficient simultaneous task execution with reduced computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches struggle with simultaneous execution of complex compositional tasks like generating translated summaries from long conversations.

Method: Adds a learnable projection layer on top of combined summarization and translation LoRA adapters, enabling effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced computational overhead.

Result: Method performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device implementations, demonstrated through an Android app capable of executing compositional tasks seamlessly.

Conclusion: The framework shows potential benefits for real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource constraints, highlighting practical viability in on-device environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream
tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters
(LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately,
standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of
complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long
conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored
specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization
and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on
top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables
effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced
computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive
retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of
our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable
of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our
solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device
implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework
in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource
constraints.

TL;DR: Lightweight inference-time method using PCA on parallel translations to steer token embeddings along language directions, reducing code-switching while preserving semantics with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multilingual LLMs often exhibit unintended code-switching, which reduces reliability in downstream tasks.

Method: Latent-space language steering identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers token embeddings along these axes to control language identity.

Result: Achieved 95-99% language classification accuracy using a single principal component and reduced next-token distributional divergence by up to 42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models.

Conclusion: Language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear separability, enabling effective control over code-switching through simple latent-space steering.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit unintended
code-switching, reducing reliability in downstream tasks. We propose
latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that
identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers
token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach
mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible
computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration.
Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single
principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to
42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further
analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that
language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear
separability.

*Minju Gwak,Guijin Son,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' Chain-of-Thought reasoning shows uneven information flow patterns, contrasting with human communication's uniform information density, suggesting new approaches for interpretable reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps are often unfaithful or hard to interpret, inspired by the Uniform Information Density hypothesis from psycholinguistics.

Method: Introduced entropy-based metrics to analyze information flow within reasoning traces across three challenging mathematical benchmarks.

Result: Found that successful reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform - correct solutions show uneven swings in information density, contrasting with human communication patterns.

Conclusion: Challenges assumptions about machine reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive reasoning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently
unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density
(UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate
by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based
metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly,
across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful
reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized
by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human
communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine
reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive
reasoning models.

*Sicheng Lyu,Yu Gu,Xinyu Wang,Jerry Huang,Sitao Luan,Yufei Cui,Xiao-Wen Chang,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvoEdit is a novel model editing strategy that uses sequential null-space alignment to mitigate catastrophic interference in large language models, enabling stable updates without compromising previously integrated knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model editing approaches suffer from catastrophic interference when applied sequentially, where new edits compromise previously integrated updates and degrade preserved knowledge.

Method: EvoEdit performs sequential null-space alignment for each incoming edit to preserve both original and previously modified knowledge representations while maintaining output invariance on preserved knowledge.

Result: EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art locate-then-edit techniques with up to 3.53 times speedup, effectively mitigating interference across long edit sequences.

Conclusion: The results underscore the necessity of developing principled approaches for LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, with EvoEdit providing a simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require continual updates to rectify outdated or
erroneous knowledge. Model editing has emerged as a compelling paradigm for
introducing targeted modifications without the computational burden of full
retraining. Existing approaches are mainly based on a locate-then-edit
framework. However, in sequential editing contexts, where multiple updates are
applied over time, they exhibit significant limitations and suffer from
catastrophic interference, i.e., new edits compromise previously integrated
updates and degrade preserved knowledge. To address these challenges, we
introduce EvoEdit, a novel editing strategy that mitigates catastrophic
interference through sequential null-space alignment, enabling stable and
efficient model editing. By performing sequential null-space alignment for each
incoming edit, EvoEdit preserves both original and previously modified
knowledge representations and maintains output invariance on preserved
knowledge even across long edit sequences, effectively mitigating interference.
Evaluations on real-world sequential knowledge-editing benchmarks show that
EvoEdit achieves better or comparable performance than prior state-of-the-art
locate-then-edit techniques, with up to 3.53 times speedup. Overall, these
results underscore the necessity of developing more principled approaches for
designing LLMs in dynamically evolving information settings, while providing a
simple yet effective solution with strong theoretical guarantees.

*Peter Banyas,Shristi Sharma,Alistair Simmons,Atharva Vispute*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConsistencyAI is a benchmark for measuring factual consistency of LLMs across different personas, showing that models provide inconsistent facts when queried by users with different demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether LLMs provide factually consistent answers to identical questions when prompted with different personas, addressing potential demographic bias in model responses.

Method: Tested 19 LLMs by querying them for 5 facts on 15 topics, repeating 100 times with different persona contexts. Used sentence embeddings and cross-persona cosine similarity to compute factual consistency scores.

Result: Factual consistency scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896 (mean 0.8656). xAI's Grok-3 was most consistent, while lightweight models ranked lowest. Consistency varied by topic and provider.

Conclusion: Both the LLM provider and topic significantly influence factual consistency across personas, highlighting the need for persona-invariant prompting strategies and impartial evaluation benchmarks.

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper
introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual
consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas.
ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical
questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed
without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial
evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with
prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query
100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different
persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We
processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine
similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine
similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments,
scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as
a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several
lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is
least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that
both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our
code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage
persona-invariant prompting strategies.

*Fabian Wenz,Omar Bouattour,Devin Yang,Justin Choi,Cecil Gregg,Nesime Tatbul,Çağatay Demiralp*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BenchPress is a human-in-the-loop system that uses RAG and LLMs to accelerate creation of domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks by generating natural language descriptions from SQL queries, with human experts verifying and refining the outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manually annotating SQL logs to create text-to-SQL benchmarks for private enterprise data is challenging and costly, requiring database administrators' expertise. Existing benchmarks focus on public datasets, while enterprise data warehouses present unique challenges.

Method: Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to ensure accuracy and domain alignment.

Result: LLM-assisted annotation drastically reduces time and effort for creating high-quality benchmarks. Combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation robustness.

Conclusion: BenchPress provides an effective mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL models on domain-specific workloads by streamlining custom benchmark creation, making it freely available as an open-source tool.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks,
including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on
publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work
showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise
data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL
benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily
available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural
language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database
administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to
construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only
challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce
BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of
domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural
language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to
ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated
enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically
reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our
results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions
enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation
robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress
offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL
models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via
our public GitHub repository at

### [20] [R2T: Rule-Encoded Loss Functions for Low-Resource Sequence Tagging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13854)
*Mamadou K. Keita,Christopher Homan,Sebastien Diarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The R2T framework integrates linguistic rules into neural network training through an adaptive loss function, enabling models to handle OOV words with principled uncertainty. It achieves 98.2% accuracy on Zarma POS tagging using only unlabeled text and serves as effective pre-training for NER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a principled learning approach where models are trained with explicit task constraints rather than relying solely on labeled examples, addressing the challenge of handling out-of-vocabulary words and reducing dependency on large labeled datasets.

Method: Hybrid framework combining multi-tiered linguistic rules with neural network training via an adaptive loss function that includes regularization for principled uncertainty handling of OOV words.

Result: R2T-BiLSTM achieved 98.2% accuracy on Zarma POS tagging using only unlabeled text, outperforming AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. For NER, R2T pre-training with 50 labeled sentences outperformed baseline trained on 300 sentences.

Conclusion: The R2T framework demonstrates that principled learning with explicit constraints enables effective learning from unlabeled data and serves as powerful pre-training, significantly reducing the need for labeled data while maintaining high performance.

Abstract: We introduce the Rule-to-Tag (R2T) framework, a hybrid approach that
integrates a multi-tiered system of linguistic rules directly into a neural
network's training objective. R2T's novelty lies in its adaptive loss function,
which includes a regularization term that teaches the model to handle
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words with principled uncertainty. We frame this work
as a case study in a paradigm we call principled learning (PrL), where models
are trained with explicit task constraints rather than on labeled examples
alone. Our experiments on Zarma part-of-speech (POS) tagging show that the
R2T-BiLSTM model, trained only on unlabeled text, achieves 98.2% accuracy,
outperforming baselines like AfriBERTa fine-tuned on 300 labeled sentences. We
further show that for more complex tasks like named entity recognition (NER),
R2T serves as a powerful pre-training step; a model pre-trained with R2T and
fine-tuned on just 50 labeled sentences outperformes a baseline trained on 300.

*Zhichen Zeng,Qi Yu,Xiao Lin,Ruizhong Qiu,Xuying Ning,Tianxin Wei,Yuchen Yan,Jingrui He,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoRE is a plug-and-play technique that improves LLM ensemble robustness by addressing token-level and model-level inconsistencies through consistency filtering mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM ensembles often fail due to erroneous signals from heterogeneous tokenization schemes and varying model expertise, leading to token-level disagreements and model-level confidence disparities.

Method: CoRE uses token-level consistency (low-pass filter for uncertain tokens) and model-level consistency (promoting outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence) to enhance ensemble robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies show CoRE consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Conclusion: CoRE effectively addresses ensemble failures by leveraging model consistency at both token and model levels, providing a robust plug-and-play solution for LLM ensembles.

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and
weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their
complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble
quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against
potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization
schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures
typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former
reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves
low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we
propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for
robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble
methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by
applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high
inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at
a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting
model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others,
enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE
consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To support clinical decision-making through natural language queries over medical images, specifically addressing wound-care VQA which requires generating both free-text responses and structured wound attributes.

Method: Uses a general-domain instruction-tuned LLM with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and visual examples from in-domain data, employing minimal inference-time layer with simple indexing and fusion without extra training.

Result: Ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with average score of 41.37%, showing improved performance across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics.

Conclusion: Lightweight RAG with general-purpose LLMs provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical NLP tasks, demonstrating that minimal inference-time enhancements can significantly improve reasoning and response quality.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries
over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The
MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to
generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and
patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a
general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and
visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in
clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and
response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our
best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an
average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with
general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant
exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex
re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical
NLP tasks.

TL;DR: ShishuLM is an efficient language model architecture that reduces parameter count and KV cache requirements by approximating transformer blocks with MLPs, achieving 25% memory reduction and 40% latency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have substantial memory and computational overhead with identified architectural redundancies, presenting optimization opportunities without performance compromise, especially important for Small Language Models in agentic AI systems.

Method: Leverages insights from AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, approximates entire transformer blocks through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by exploiting that normalization and attention computation are roughly linear with input in moderate-context scenarios.

Result: ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40% improvement in latency during both training and inference compared to parent models, evaluated on two SLMs of different scales.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights towards building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint by identifying architectural redundancies and optimization opportunities in transformer models.

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance
on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory
and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant
architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for
optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in
AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient
language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the
parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing
importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate
our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for
moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is
roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be
approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that
ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40%
improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent
models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards
building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

*Chenyu Zhang,Sharifa Alghowinem,Cynthia Breazeal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an ensemble-LLM framework for analyzing affective states in AI tutoring dialogues, revealing that students experience mildly positive affect with frequent confusion and curiosity during learning, with emotional states being short-lived but neutral moments serving as key turning points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring, as current research has insufficiently examined learners' emotional experiences in educational AI contexts.

Method: Analyzed 16,986 conversational turns from PyTutor AI tutor using three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude) for zero-shot affect annotations, employing rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus to create robust emotion profiles.

Result: Students typically report mildly positive affect and moderate arousal during AI tutoring. Confusion and curiosity are frequent, frustration can derail progress, emotional states are short-lived (positive ones last slightly longer), and neutral moments often serve as turning points that steer students upward.

Conclusion: The ensemble-LLM framework provides insights into emotional dynamics in AI tutoring, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene at neutral junctures and highlighting the importance of attending to learners' evolving affective states for responsible AI integration in education.

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model
(LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring
remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM
framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the
conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into
education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this,
we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged
between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across
three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we
generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o,
Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and
learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are
fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across
models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during
interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect
and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and
curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while
less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states
are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative
ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative
emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive
states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering
students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene
at precisely these junctures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Template Infilling (TI) is a new conditioning method for Diffusion Language Models that generates structural templates first, then fills masked segments, with Dynamic Segment Allocation for adaptive segment length adjustment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference strategies for Diffusion Language Models are limited to prefix-based prompting inherited from autoregressive models, which doesn't fully leverage DLMs' capabilities.

Method: Template Infilling generates structural templates for target responses first, then fills masked segments, enhanced by Dynamic Segment Allocation that adaptively adjusts segment lengths based on generation confidence.

Result: Achieved consistent improvements of 17.01% over baseline on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, with additional advantages in multi-token generation settings enabling effective speedup while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: Template Infilling provides a more effective conditioning methodology for Diffusion Language Models than traditional prefix prompting, offering improved performance and flexibility in generation control.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited
to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this
paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology
for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first
generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the
masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we
introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment
lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving
consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that
TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling
effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Conclusion: FRACCO provides a reference standard for named entity recognition and concept normalisation in French oncology texts, addressing the resource scarcity in French clinical NLP.

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires
annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present
FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated
corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the

composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements
into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert
review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain

*Filipe Laitenberger,Dawid Kopiczko,Cees G. M. Snoek,Yuki M. Asano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GateSkip introduces token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs using sigmoid-linear gates on Attention/MLP branches, enabling compute savings while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient inference in large language models by skipping less important tokens per layer, addressing instability issues in existing early-exit and Mixture-of-Depths approaches.

Method: Adds sigmoid-linear gates to each Attention/MLP branch that condense outputs before re-entering residual stream, then ranks tokens by gate values and skips low-importance ones using per-layer budget during inference.

Result: Achieves up to 15% compute savings on long-form reasoning while retaining over 90% baseline accuracy, and matches baseline quality with 50% savings on instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: GateSkip provides stable fine-tuning, offers insights into transformer information flow, and combines well with other optimization techniques like quantization and pruning.

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables
token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is
equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before
it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate
values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit
or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need
extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top
of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while
retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see
accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings.
The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS
tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization,
pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

### [29] [TextBandit: Evaluating Probabilistic Reasoning in LLMs Through Language-Only Decision Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13878)
*Jimin Lim,Arjun Damerla,Arthur Jiang,Nam Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can perform sequential decision-making under uncertainty using only natural language feedback in multi-armed bandit environments, with Qwen3-4B achieving 89.2% best-arm selection rate, outperforming both larger LLMs and traditional algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LLMs' ability to make sequential decisions under uncertainty using only natural language feedback, without access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities.

Method: Created a benchmark where LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit environments using purely textual feedback ("you earned a token"), forcing models to infer latent reward structures from linguistic cues and adapt accordingly.

Result: Most LLMs underperformed compared to standard algorithms (Thompson Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, UCB, random choice), but Qwen3-4B achieved 89.2% best-arm selection rate, significantly outperforming both larger LLMs and traditional methods.

Conclusion: Probabilistic reasoning can emerge from language alone, and this benchmark represents a step toward evaluating decision-making capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown to be increasingly capable of
performing reasoning tasks, but their ability to make sequential decisions
under uncertainty only using natural language remains underexplored. We
introduce a novel benchmark in which LLMs interact with multi-armed bandit
environments using purely textual feedback, "you earned a token", without
access to numerical cues or explicit probabilities, resulting in the model to
infer latent reward structures purely off linguistic cues and to adapt
accordingly. We evaluated the performance of four open-source LLMs and compare
their performance to standard decision-making algorithms such as Thompson
Sampling, Epsilon Greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), and random choice.
While most of the LLMs underperformed compared to the baselines, Qwen3-4B,
achieved the best-arm selection rate of 89.2% , which significantly
outperformed both the larger LLMs and traditional methods. Our findings suggest
that probabilistic reasoning is able to emerge from language alone, and we
present this benchmark as a step towards evaluating decision-making
capabilities in naturalistic, non-numeric contexts.

### [30] [Catch Your Breath: Adaptive Computation for Self-Paced Sequence Production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13879)
*Alexandre Galashov,Matt Jones,Rosemary Ke,Yuan Cao,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Michael C. Mozer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'Catch Your Breath' (CYB) methods that enable language models to dynamically request additional compute steps for difficult tokens using <don't know> outputs and <pause> tokens, improving efficiency and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To allow language models to autonomously scale compute resources per token based on difficulty, improving computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy by letting models request more processing time when uncertain.

Method: Three CYB loss variants: CYB-AP (anytime prediction with time-discounted accuracy), CYB-VA (variational approach maximizing accuracy under stopping time distribution), and CYB-DP (computational budget penalty). Models use <don't know> outputs to request pauses and receive <pause> tokens for additional compute.

Result: CYB models achieve same performance with only 1/3 of baseline training data and 1/2 of pause-enabled cross-entropy model data. Models intelligently pause for complex tokens (plural nouns, ambiguous words) but not for simple ones (contractions).

Conclusion: The CYB framework enables efficient dynamic compute allocation, with models learning to request additional processing only when beneficial, adapting to token complexity and context while reducing training data requirements.

Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language
model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used
for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute
steps by emitting a <don't know> output. If the model is granted a delay, a
specialized <pause> token is inserted at the next input step, providing the
model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can
request multiple pauses. To train the model to use <don't know> outputs
judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each
output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the
class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three
methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction,
where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over
time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction
accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP
imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning
experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs
only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to
achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and
a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when
doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to
token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural
nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after
the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$,
and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which
could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

### [31] [PAGE: Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13880)
*Mauro Jose Pacchiotti,Luciana Ballejos,Mariel Ale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAGE is a framework that uses lightweight auxiliary modules (like classifiers) to enhance text generation models by providing enriched inputs, improving quality and controllability without requiring additional generative models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural language generative models often perform poorly on specific tasks or require large amounts of adjustment data, necessitating a simpler enhancement approach.

Method: PAGE uses simple auxiliary modules (classifiers/extractors) that provide inferences from input text to construct enriched inputs for generation models, creating a modular architecture adaptable to different tasks.

Result: A proof of concept in requirements engineering demonstrated improved quality of software requirements generation using an auxiliary classifier module.

Conclusion: PAGE provides an effective, modular framework for enhancing text generation models without requiring complex auxiliary generative models, offering improved controllability and adaptability.

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding
performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or
particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require
adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces
PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework
designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules.
These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide
inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to
construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of
the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not
require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular
architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the
proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in
the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a
classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

### [32] [Too Open for Opinion? Embracing Open-Endedness in Large Language Models for Social Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13884)
*Bolei Ma,Yong Cao,Indira Sen,Anna-Carolina Haensch,Frauke Kreuter,Barbara Plank,Daniel Hershcovich*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM social simulations should use open-ended text generation rather than constrained formats to better capture realistic opinions and reduce researcher bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM social simulations use multiple-choice or short-answer formats for scoring convenience, but this overlooks LLMs' generative nature and limits the realism of simulated social phenomena.

Method: Advocate for open-ended text generation in LLM social simulations, drawing on survey methodology research and NLP advances to capture topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes.

Result: Open-ended approaches can improve measurement, support exploration of unanticipated views, reduce directive bias, capture expressiveness and individuality, aid in pretesting, and enhance methodological utility.

Conclusion: Researchers should develop practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage LLMs' generative diversity rather than constraining it, creating synergies between NLP and social science.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate public opinion
and other social phenomena. Most current studies constrain these simulations to
multiple-choice or short-answer formats for ease of scoring and comparison, but
such closed designs overlook the inherently generative nature of LLMs. In this
position paper, we argue that open-endedness, using free-form text that
captures topics, viewpoints, and reasoning processes "in" LLMs, is essential
for realistic social simulation. Drawing on decades of survey-methodology
research and recent advances in NLP, we argue why this open-endedness is
valuable in LLM social simulations, showing how it can improve measurement and
design, support exploration of unanticipated views, and reduce
researcher-imposed directive bias. It also captures expressiveness and
individuality, aids in pretesting, and ultimately enhances methodological
utility. We call for novel practices and evaluation frameworks that leverage
rather than constrain the open-ended generative diversity of LLMs, creating
synergies between NLP and social science.

### [33] [Order from Chaos: Comparative Study of Ten Leading LLMs on Unstructured Data Categorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13885)
*Ariel Kamen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Comparative evaluation of 10 LLMs for text categorization using IAB taxonomy shows moderate performance (41% F1-score) with frequent category overproduction. Ensemble methods significantly outperform individual models by eliminating hallucinations and improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs' performance in hierarchical text categorization tasks and understand their limitations in compressing unstructured text into predefined taxonomies.

Method: Used uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples with identical zero-shot prompts across 10 LLMs. Evaluated using classic metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1) and LLM-specific indicators (hallucination, inflation ratios, cost). Developed ensemble approach with multiple LLMs as independent experts.

Result: LLMs achieved moderate performance: 34% accuracy, 42% precision, 45% recall, 41% F1-score. High hallucination and inflation ratios. Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT models offered best cost-performance balance. Ensemble method substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and eliminated hallucinations completely.

Conclusion: Scaling and architectural improvements alone don't ensure better categorization accuracy. Coordinated orchestration of multiple models via ensemble methods is more effective than individual model scale for achieving human-expert performance in text categorization.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large
language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the
Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis
employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical
zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models.
Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio,
inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve
only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42%
precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios
reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human
annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B
offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B
demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling
and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization
accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a
limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was
developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as
independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and
completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated
orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most
effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in
large-scale text categorization.

*Wenjie Ma,Andrei Cojocaru,Neel Kolhe,Bradley Louie,Robin Said Sharif,Haihan Zhang,Vincent Zhuang,Matei Zaharia,Sewon Min*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces ProofBench, an expert-annotated dataset for evaluating LLM-generated math proofs, and develops ProofGrader, a fine-grained evaluator that achieves low error against expert scores and significantly improves proof selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM evaluation for mathematical reasoning focuses on tasks with easily verifiable answers, but generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains challenging due to the absence of reliable fine-grained evaluators.

Method: Proposed systematic methodology for developing evaluators using ProofBench dataset (145 problems from major math competitions with 435 LLM-generated solutions). Explored evaluator design across backbone models, input context, instructions, and workflows. Developed ProofGrader combining strong reasoning backbone, reference solutions, marking schemes, and ensembling.

Result: ProofGrader achieves MAE of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive baselines. In best-of-n selection (n=16), achieves average score of 4.14/7, closing 78% of gap between naive binary evaluator (2.48) and human oracle (4.62).

Conclusion: ProofGrader demonstrates strong potential for advancing downstream proof generation by providing reliable fine-grained evaluation of LLM-generated math proofs, addressing a critical gap in mathematical reasoning evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning
have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however,
generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open
challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for
LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a
systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign
fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable
this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of
fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math
competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from
Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as
a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key
axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow.
Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong
reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking
schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive
baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$
selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out
of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the
human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof
generation.

TL;DR: This paper systematically surveys collaborative frameworks between Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to address LLM limitations like high costs, latency, and reliability concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs face challenges including high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and reliability issues. SLMs offer complementary benefits with their compact size, efficiency, and adaptability, motivating research into collaborative frameworks that combine SLMs' specialization with LLMs' generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: The paper identifies open challenges and future directions for developing efficient, secure, and scalable SLM-LLM collaboration systems that can better meet diverse objectives across various tasks and deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but
face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and
reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and
adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative
frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs'
generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and
deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a
systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration
objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement,
cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this
framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and
outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and
scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: THTB is a cognitive science-inspired framework that selects high-quality instruction data for LLM fine-tuning by prioritizing higher-level cognitive instructions through quality filtering and hardness scoring, achieving superior performance with only 5% of data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for selecting SFT data suffer from over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited generalization, creating a need for more effective data selection approaches.

Method: THTB combines quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring to prioritize higher-level cognitive instructions, providing interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT data selection and annotation guidance.

Result: Models trained on only 5% of data selected by THTB outperform full-dataset training and achieve superior generalization compared to LLM-only selection. In vertical domains, models trained on just 2% of data surpass those trained on much larger datasets.

Conclusion: THTB demonstrates strong potential for domain adaptation and efficient LLM fine-tuning, offering an interpretable framework that significantly reduces training data requirements while maintaining or improving performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks, but adapting them to
specialized domains relies on high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data.
Although existing methods can identify subsets of high-quality data and reduce
training cost to some extent, their selection process still suffers from
over-reliance on LLMs' internal knowledge, weak interpretability, and limited
generalization. To address these limitations, we propose THTB (The Harder The
Better), a cognitive science-inspired framework for instruction data selection
and annotation guidance. THTB prioritizes higher-level cognitive instructions
by combining quality filtering with intrinsic and extrinsic hardness scoring,
offering interpretable and quantifiable criteria for efficient SFT, both in
data selection and annotation guidance. Experiments show that THTB enables
models trained on only 5% of the data to outperform full-dataset training,
while achieving superior generalization compared with LLM-only selection. In
addition, THTB provides effective annotation guidance in vertical domains,
enabling a model trained on just 2% of the data to surpass models trained on
much larger datasets, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation. Our

*Olga E. Sorokoletova,Francesco Giarrusso,Vincenzo Suriani,Daniele Nardi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Developed comprehensive jailbreak taxonomy with 50 strategies across 7 families, analyzed attack prevalence/success rates, benchmarked detection methods, and created Italian multi-turn adversarial dialogue dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing defenses focus on single-turn attacks, lack cross-language coverage, and use limited taxonomies that don't capture full diversity of jailbreaking techniques or emphasize risk categories over techniques.

Method: Conducted structured red-teaming challenge to develop hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak strategies across 7 families, analyzed challenge data for attack prevalence/success, benchmarked LLM detection with taxonomy-guided prompting.

Result: Created comprehensive jailbreak taxonomy with 7 families (impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, data poisoning), analyzed how specific strategies exploit model vulnerabilities, and compiled Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues.

Conclusion: The structured approach provides deeper understanding of jailbreak effectiveness, enables improved detection through taxonomy-guided methods, and offers resources for studying multi-turn adversarial interactions that bypass traditional safeguards.

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large
Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn
attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that
either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize
risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the
understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a
structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold.
First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak
strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad
families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive
overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed
the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success
rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak
strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we
benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of
taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we
compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues,
annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where
adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional
safeguards.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks two authorship attribution methods (Style Embeddings and GPT-4o LLM Judge) on AI-generated content, finding complementary strengths across different text domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-generated text becomes indistinguishable from human writing, reliable authorship attribution methods are needed to identify machine-generated content.

Method: Evaluated fixed Style Embeddings and an instruction-tuned GPT-4o LLM Judge on the Human AI Parallel Corpus containing 600 balanced instances across six domains with human and LLM-generated continuations.

Result: Style Embeddings achieved 82% accuracy on GPT continuations vs 68% for LLM Judge, while LLM Judge performed slightly better on LLaMA continuations (85% vs 81%). LLM Judge excelled in fiction and academic prose, while embeddings dominated in spoken and scripted dialogue.

Conclusion: Authorship attribution is a multidimensional problem requiring hybrid strategies that combine semantic sensitivity (LLM Judge) with structural analysis (embeddings), with an open framework provided for reproducible benchmarking.

Abstract: Attributing authorship in the era of large language models (LLMs) is
increasingly challenging as machine-generated prose rivals human writing. We
benchmark two complementary attribution mechanisms , fixed Style Embeddings and
an instruction-tuned LLM judge (GPT-4o) on the Human AI Parallel Corpus, an
open dataset of 600 balanced instances spanning six domains (academic, news,
fiction, blogs, spoken transcripts, and TV/movie scripts). Each instance
contains a human prompt with both a gold continuation and an LLM-generated
continuation from either GPT-4o or LLaMA-70B-Instruct. The Style Embedding
baseline achieves stronger aggregate accuracy on GPT continuations (82 pct vs.
68 pct). The LLM Judge is slightly better than the Style embeddings on LLaMA
continuations (85 pct vs. 81 pct) but the results are not statistically
significant. Crucially, the LLM judge significantly outperforms in fiction and
academic prose, indicating semantic sensitivity, whereas embeddings dominate in
spoken and scripted dialogue, reflecting structural strengths. These
complementary patterns highlight attribution as a multidimensional problem
requiring hybrid strategies. To support reproducibility we provide code on
GitHub and derived data on Hugging Face under the MIT license. This open
framework provides a reproducible benchmark for attribution quality assessment
in AI-generated content, along with a review of related literature influencing
this work.

*Julian Minder,Clément Dumas,Stewart Slocum,Helena Casademunt,Cameron Holmes,Robert West,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Narrow finetuning creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be analyzed through model diffing. These biases reveal the finetuning domain and can be used to generate text similar to the training data format and content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how narrow finetuning affects LLM activations and whether these biases can be interpreted to reveal the finetuning domain, which has implications for AI safety and interpretability research.

Method: Using model diffing techniques to analyze activation differences on random text, steering by adding these differences to model activations, and creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand finetuning domains across various architectures and scales.

Result: Narrow finetuning creates salient biases in activations that reflect the training objective. These biases can be used to generate text similar to finetuning data, and mixing pretraining data reduces but doesn't eliminate these biases.

Conclusion: Narrowly finetuned models contain clear traces of their training in activations, suggesting current practices in AI safety research using such models may not be realistic, and highlighting the need for better training methods and more realistic case studies.

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large
Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known
unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning
creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand
the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from
model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after
finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few
tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model
activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the
finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information
by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning
domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better
compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans
synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment,
subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different
architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We
suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data
into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may
remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient
traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to
improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability
researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for
studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3)
highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow
finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing,
safety and interpretability research.

*Tuan T. Nguyen,John Le,Thai T. Vu,Willy Susilo,Heath Cooper*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAID is a framework that creates adversarial suffixes to jailbreak LLMs by optimizing continuous embeddings with refusal-aware regularization and coherence terms, achieving higher attack success rates with fewer queries than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have safety vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks, and current methods are inefficient. RAID aims to systematically probe these weaknesses with a more effective and computationally efficient approach.

Method: RAID relaxes discrete tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective that encourages restricted responses, uses refusal-aware regularization to steer away from refusal directions, and maintains semantic plausibility through coherence terms. It then uses critic-guided decoding to map embeddings back to tokens.

Result: Experiments on multiple open-source LLMs show RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across diverse
tasks yet remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety mechanisms.
We present RAID (Refusal-Aware and Integrated Decoding), a framework that
systematically probes these weaknesses by crafting adversarial suffixes that
induce restricted content while preserving fluency. RAID relaxes discrete
tokens into continuous embeddings and optimizes them with a joint objective
that (i) encourages restricted responses, (ii) incorporates a refusal-aware
regularizer to steer activations away from refusal directions in embedding
space, and (iii) applies a coherence term to maintain semantic plausibility and
non-redundancy. After optimization, a critic-guided decoding procedure maps
embeddings back to tokens by balancing embedding affinity with language-model
likelihood. This integration yields suffixes that are both effective in
bypassing defenses and natural in form. Experiments on multiple open-source
LLMs show that RAID achieves higher attack success rates with fewer queries and
lower computational cost than recent white-box and black-box baselines. These
findings highlight the importance of embedding-space regularization for
understanding and mitigating LLM jailbreak vulnerabilities.

### [41] [Investigating Political and Demographic Associations in Large Language Models Through Moral Foundations Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13902)
*Nicole Smith-Vaniz,Harper Lyon,Lorraine Steigner,Ben Armstrong,Nicholas Mattei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper analyzes moral and political biases in LLMs using Moral Foundations Theory, comparing LLM responses with human data to examine ideological leanings and representation accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used for advice in sensitive domains, raising concerns about potential political and moral biases in their responses, especially given their significant roles in everyday life.

Method: Applied Moral Foundations Theory framework to analyze LLM responses, comparing them with existing human research data. Examined LLM behavior through inherent responses, explicit political ideology prompting, and demographic-based role-playing scenarios.

Result: The study systematically assessed whether LLMs generate responses that align with specific political ideologies and how accurately they can represent ideological perspectives through different prompting methods.

Conclusion: The research provides insights into the extent of political and demographic dependency in AI-generated responses, addressing gaps in understanding LLM moral leanings and their connection to human data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly incorporated into
everyday life for many internet users, taking on significant roles as advice
givers in the domains of medicine, personal relationships, and even legal
matters. The importance of these roles raise questions about how and what
responses LLMs make in difficult political and moral domains, especially
questions about possible biases. To quantify the nature of potential biases in
LLMs, various works have applied Moral Foundations Theory (MFT), a framework
that categorizes human moral reasoning into five dimensions: Harm, Fairness,
Ingroup Loyalty, Authority, and Purity. Previous research has used the MFT to
measure differences in human participants along political, national, and
cultural lines. While there has been some analysis of the responses of LLM with
respect to political stance in role-playing scenarios, no work so far has
directly assessed the moral leanings in the LLM responses, nor have they
connected LLM outputs with robust human data. In this paper we analyze the
distinctions between LLM MFT responses and existing human research directly,
investigating whether commonly available LLM responses demonstrate ideological
leanings: either through their inherent responses, straightforward
representations of political ideologies, or when responding from the
perspectives of constructed human personas. We assess whether LLMs inherently
generate responses that align more closely with one political ideology over
another, and additionally examine how accurately LLMs can represent ideological
perspectives through both explicit prompting and demographic-based
role-playing. By systematically analyzing LLM behavior across these conditions
and experiments, our study provides insight into the extent of political and
demographic dependency in AI-generated responses.

### [42] [Schema for In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13905)
*Pan Chen,Shaohong Chen,Mark Wang,Shi Xuan Leong,Priscilla Fung,Varinia Bernales,Alan Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SA-ICL introduces schema-based in-context learning that extracts abstract reasoning templates from examples to enhance LLM performance on novel questions, achieving up to 36.19% improvement on scientific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ICL lacks explicit knowledge retrieval and transfer mechanisms at the abstraction level, unlike human cognition which uses schemas (mental frameworks) to structure understanding of new information.

Method: Extracts building blocks of cognition from prior examples to create lightweight, structured templates (schemas) of key inferential steps and relationships, then uses these schemas to augment reasoning for novel questions.

Result: LLMs significantly benefit from explicit schema-based scaffolding, with SA-ICL boosting performance up to 36.19% on GPQA chemistry and physics questions, reducing reliance on demonstration quantity and enhancing interpretability.

Conclusion: SA-ICL bridges different ICL strategies and paves a new path for enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs by making schema-based learning explicit rather than implicit.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt
to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional
example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge
retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science,
specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information
by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure
understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This
framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for
the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted
schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their
relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when
presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large
language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal
schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit
significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and
physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL
consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single
demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance
on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED
IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from
pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for
enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PDO is a label-free prompt optimization framework that uses dueling-bandit approach with pairwise preference feedback from LLM judges, outperforming baselines on BBH and MS MARCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automatic prompt optimization methods require expensive ground-truth labels, which are costly and slow to collect in practice.

Method: Formulates prompt optimization as dueling-bandit problem using Double Thompson Sampling for informative comparisons and Top-Performer Guided Mutation to expand candidate pool.

Result: PDO consistently outperforms baseline methods on BIG-bench Hard and MS MARCO datasets.

Conclusion: PDO provides effective label-free prompt optimization and can also incorporate partial labels to handle judge noise.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to their input prompts,
making prompt design a central challenge. While automatic prompt optimization
(APO) reduces manual engineering, most approaches assume access to ground-truth
references such as labeled validation data. In practice, however, collecting
high-quality labels is costly and slow. We propose the Prompt Duel Optimizer
(PDO), a sample-efficient framework for label-free prompt optimization. PDO
formulates the problem as a dueling-bandit setting, where supervision signal
comes from pairwise preference feedback provided by an LLM judge. The framework
combines Double Thompson Sampling (D-TS), which prioritizes informative prompt
comparisons, with Top-Performer Guided Mutation, which expands the candidate
pool by mutating high-performing prompts. PDO naturally operates in label-free
settings and can also incorporate partial labels to mitigate judge noise.
Experiments on BIG-bench Hard (BBH) and MS MARCO show that PDO consistently
outperforms baseline methods. Ablation studies further demonstrate the
effectiveness of both D-TS and prompt mutation.

*Dharunish Yugeswardeenoo,Harshil Nukala,Cole Blondin,Sean O Brien,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with arithmetic despite strong reasoning. This paper investigates if LLaMA 3.2-3B encodes operator precedence internally using interpretability techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs have impressive reasoning but struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior work focused on outputs and prompting, leaving open how models internally compute arithmetic.

Method: Used instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B with arithmetic expressions dataset. Applied logit lens, linear probes, UMAP visualization, and introduced partial embedding swap technique.

Result: Intermediate computations appear in residual stream, especially after MLP blocks. Model linearly encodes precedence in operator embeddings post attention layer.

Conclusion: LLaMA 3.2-3B internally encodes operator precedence, with intermediate results visible in residual stream and precedence encoded in operator embeddings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities but continue to struggle with arithmetic tasks. Prior works
largely focus on outputs or prompting strategies, leaving the open question of
the internal structure through which models do arithmetic computation. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs encode operator precedence in their internal
representations via the open-source instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We
constructed a dataset of arithmetic expressions with three operands and two
operators, varying the order and placement of parentheses. Using this dataset,
we trace whether intermediate results appear in the residual stream of the
instruction-tuned LLaMA 3.2-3B model. We apply interpretability techniques such
as logit lens, linear classification probes, and UMAP geometric visualization.
Our results show that intermediate computations are present in the residual
stream, particularly after MLP blocks. We also find that the model linearly
encodes precedence in each operator's embeddings post attention layer. We
introduce partial embedding swap, a technique that modifies operator precedence
by exchanging high-impact embedding dimensions between operators.

TL;DR: Proposes KRLM, a Knowledge Reasoning Language Model that coordinates LLM knowledge with KG context to address LLM knowledge distortion and generative hallucinations in inductive knowledge graph reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based KGFMs suffer from LLM knowledge distortion due to sparse KG context overshadowing intrinsic LLM knowledge, and struggle to constrain generative hallucinations, limiting reasoning credibility.

Method: Uses Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations, KRL attention layer with dynamic knowledge memory mechanism, and structure-aware next-entity predictor to constrain results.

Result: Demonstrates significant superiority on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets in both zero-shot reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

Conclusion: KRLM effectively coordinates LLM knowledge with KG context throughout the reasoning process, addressing knowledge distortion and constraining hallucinations for more credible inductive reasoning.

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in
open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a
challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing
studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn
structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain
knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based
KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However,
the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context,
leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to
model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to
fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the
credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a
Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination
between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically,
we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL
tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a
KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG
context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a
structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains
the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive
experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the
significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are

*Jingru Lin,Chen Zhang,Stephen Y. Liu,Haizhou Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGCap-Bench is a new benchmark for evaluating intermediate capabilities in agentic RAG systems, showing that stronger performance on these tasks leads to better end-to-end results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic RAG systems struggle with complex multi-hop questions and their intermediate reasoning capabilities are underexplored, despite RAG's benefits in mitigating LLM limitations like factual errors and hallucinations.

Method: Proposed RAGCap-Bench benchmark by analyzing outputs from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and required capabilities, then constructing a taxonomy of LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that 'slow-thinking' models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better end-to-end results, validating the benchmark's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The benchmark successfully identifies key intermediate capabilities in agentic RAG workflows, and enhancing these capabilities is crucial for improving overall system performance on complex queries.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates key limitations of Large
Language Models (LLMs)-such as factual errors, outdated knowledge, and
hallucinations-by dynamically retrieving external information. Recent work
extends this paradigm through agentic RAG systems, where LLMs act as agents to
iteratively plan, retrieve, and reason over complex queries. However, these
systems still struggle with challenging multi-hop questions, and their
intermediate reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. To address this, we
propose RAGCap-Bench, a capability-oriented benchmark for fine-grained
evaluation of intermediate tasks in agentic RAG workflows. We analyze outputs
from state-of-the-art systems to identify common tasks and the core
capabilities required for their execution, then construct a taxonomy of typical
LLM errors to design targeted evaluation questions. Experiments show that
"slow-thinking" models with stronger RAGCap performance achieve better
end-to-end results, underscoring the benchmark's validity and the importance of
enhancing these intermediate capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI debate experiments reveal models prefer sycophantic strategies (aligning with judge's perspective) over their prior beliefs, sequential debate favors second debater, and paradoxically higher-quality arguments occur when models argue against their beliefs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether language models adopt sycophantic strategies in subjective debates by aligning with judge personas rather than their prior beliefs, and to evaluate debate protocol biases and persuasion dynamics.

Method: Applied debate to subjective questions, measured models' prior beliefs, presented conflicting judge personas, compared sequential vs simultaneous debate protocols, and assessed persuasiveness and argument quality when defending aligned vs misaligned positions.

Result: Models prefer defending judge-aligned stances over prior beliefs, sequential debate favors second debater, models are more persuasive when defending belief-aligned positions, but paradoxically produce higher-quality arguments when arguing against their beliefs.

Conclusion: Results inform better training signals for human judges and contribute to aligned AI systems, revealing important persuasion dynamics in human-AI interaction where models prioritize sycophancy over truthfulness.

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is
harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify
the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets
with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect
proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the
belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to
subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior
beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred
position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict
with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt
sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to
maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We
implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to
evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were
more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions
consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main
findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the
judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces
significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when
defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically,
arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise
comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality
training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing
important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in
language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A new data synthesis pipeline generates web agent training data by progressively increasing task complexity until baseline agents fail, creating more diverse and effective training data than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agent training data lacks fine-grained control over difficulty and quality, failing to capture the complexity needed for long-horizon reasoning. Existing methods also conflate data and training effects.

Method: Two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates question-answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until baseline web agents fail. The baseline agent validates factuality, checks for alternative answers, and enforces filtering.

Result: The synthesized dataset enables training of more effective web agents than existing datasets, with twice the diversity in tool-use actions and stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling behaviors.

Conclusion: The proposed data synthesis method produces higher-quality training data that better captures the complexity of long-horizon web-based reasoning tasks, leading to improved web agent performance.

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering
tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain
challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for
long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for
constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs.
However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and
quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity
required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data
and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization
recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the
data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates
question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a
frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in
this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for
alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of
our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on
distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based
benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training
of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data
exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it
to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling
behaviors.

*Ivan Lee,Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Readability alone doesn't predict coherence in small language models; statistical simplicity (n-gram diversity) is more important than simplified language for learning efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the interpretation that readability (simplified, child-directed language) is key for enabling coherence in small language models, and to investigate what properties actually support capability emergence.

Method: Constructed synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, comparing models trained on complex adult-level text vs simplified language, and analyzing statistical simplicity through n-gram diversity.

Result: Models trained on complex text performed comparably to those trained on simplified language, with even faster development of coherence. Statistical simplicity (n-gram diversity) was a stronger predictor of learnability than readability.

Conclusion: Readability alone doesn't predict coherence in SLMs; statistical simplicity is more important. The paper cautions against anthropomorphizing language model training and argues for more precise reasoning about capability emergence factors.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate
surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora
such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that
readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative
structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities
to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct
synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that
readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs.
Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained
on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during
training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram
diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution
against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training --
drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and
argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support
capability emergence in small models.

TL;DR: Element2Vec uses language models to generate embeddings from Wikipedia text for chemical elements, creating both general-purpose and attribute-specific vectors to predict element properties, addressing data sparsity with test-time training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods fail to model complex relationships in chemical element properties, and existing AI approaches suffer from hallucinations and lack interpretability. There's a need for better representation methods given the limited data (only 118 elements) and distribution discrepancies between common and scientific texts.

Method: Uses language models to parse Wikipedia text and generate two types of embeddings: general-purpose (Global) and attribute-highlighted vectors (Local). Implements test-time training with self-attention to reduce prediction errors from vanilla regression.

Result: The method effectively represents chemical elements from natural language text, addressing the challenges of text distribution discrepancies and extreme data sparsity for property prediction.

Conclusion: Element2Vec paves the way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science by providing interpretable and accurate element representations from natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Accurate property data for chemical elements is crucial for materials design
and manufacturing, but many of them are difficult to measure directly due to
equipment constraints. While traditional methods use the properties of other
elements or related properties for prediction via numerical analyses, they
often fail to model complex relationships. After all, not all characteristics
can be represented as scalars. Recent efforts have been made to explore
advanced AI tools such as language models for property estimation, but they
still suffer from hallucinations and a lack of interpretability. In this paper,
we investigate Element2Vecto effectively represent chemical elements from
natural languages to support research in the natural sciences. Given the text
parsed from Wikipedia pages, we use language models to generate both a single
general-purpose embedding (Global) and a set of attribute-highlighted vectors
(Local). Despite the complicated relationship across elements, the
computational challenges also exist because of 1) the discrepancy in text
distribution between common descriptions and specialized scientific texts, and
2) the extremely limited data, i.e., with only 118 known elements, data for
specific properties is often highly sparse and incomplete. Thus, we also design
a test-time training method based on self-attention to mitigate the prediction
error caused by Vanilla regression clearly. We hope this work could pave the
way for advancing AI-driven discovery in materials science.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a theoretical framework and calibration method for optimally combining LLM and PRM signals in test-time scaling, showing that intelligent aggregation outperforms simple majority voting while using significantly less computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recent benchmarks show that simple majority voting sometimes outperforms standard PRM-based selection, raising questions about how to effectively utilize PRM verification signals for test-time scaling.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework for optimal signal combination, revealing that weighted aggregation with calibrated weights is optimal. Proposed efficient pre-computation methods to calibrate weighting functions that capture the complex interplay between LLMs and PRMs.

Result: Extensive experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs show the calibration method significantly boosts TTS efficiency, surpassing vanilla weighted majority voting while using only 21.3% of the computation.

Conclusion: Investing in intelligent aggregation strategies is more effective for performance gains than simply scaling test-time computation, demonstrating the importance of properly calibrated weighting functions for optimal LLM-PRM signal combination.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) are a cornerstone of test-time scaling (TTS),
designed to verify and select the best responses from large language models
(LLMs). However, this promise is challenged by recent benchmarks where simple
majority voting, which ignores PRM signals, occasionally outperforms standard
PRM-based selection. This raises a critical question: How can we effectively
utilize verification signals from PRMs for TTS? To address this, we start by
developing a theoretical framework for optimally combining signals from both
the LLM and the PRM. Our framework reveals that the optimal strategy is a
weighted aggregation of responses, a strategy whose effectiveness hinges on
estimating weights that capture the complex interplay between the models. Based
on our theoretical results, we empirically show that these optimal weighting
functions differ significantly across LLM-PRM pairs and, notably, often assign
substantial negative weights. Motivated by these insights, we propose efficient
pre-computation methods to calibrate these weighting functions. Extensive
experiments across 5 LLMs and 7 PRMs demonstrate that our calibration method
significantly boosts the TTS efficiency, surpassing the performance of vanilla
weighted majority voting while using only $21.3\%$ of the computation.
Ultimately, our work demonstrates that investing in a more intelligent
aggregation strategy can be a more convincing path to performance gains than
simply scaling test-time computation.

TL;DR: FACTS is a fast, accurate, and privacy-compliant table summarization approach that generates reusable offline templates (SQL queries + Jinja2 templates) for query-focused table summarization, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing table summarization methods have limitations: table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods have token-limit and efficiency issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines lack robustness and scalability.

Method: FACTS uses an agentic workflow to produce offline templates consisting of SQL queries and Jinja2 templates that can be rendered into natural language summaries. These templates are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema, enabling fast summarization through template reuse.

Result: Evaluations on widely-used benchmarks show that FACTS consistently outperforms baseline methods in query-focused table summarization tasks.

Conclusion: FACTS establishes itself as a practical solution for real-world query-focused table summarization by providing fast performance through reusable templates, accurate outputs via executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table schemas to LLMs.

Abstract: Query-focused table summarization requires generating natural language
summaries of tabular data conditioned on a user query, enabling users to access
insights beyond fact retrieval. Existing approaches face key limitations:
table-to-text models require costly fine-tuning and struggle with complex
reasoning, prompt-based LLM methods suffer from token-limit and efficiency
issues while exposing sensitive data, and prior agentic pipelines often rely on
decomposition, planning, or manual templates that lack robustness and
scalability. To mitigate these issues, we introduce an agentic workflow, FACTS,
a Fast, Accurate, and Privacy-Compliant Table Summarization approach via
Offline Template Generation. FACTS produces offline templates, consisting of
SQL queries and Jinja2 templates, which can be rendered into natural language
summaries and are reusable across multiple tables sharing the same schema. It
enables fast summarization through reusable offline templates, accurate outputs
with executable SQL queries, and privacy compliance by sending only table

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT networks generate diverse high-volume traffic that requires cross-layer interpretation rather than isolated detection to derive meaningful insights from both normal activity and potential threats.

Method: Integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly detection, packet/flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and retrieval-augmented QA with an AI agent guided by LLM reasoning over indexed traffic artifacts.

Result: Hybrid retrieval (lexical + semantic search with reranking) substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared to dense-only retrieval, with low CPU/GPU/memory overhead.

Conclusion: The framework achieves holistic and efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic through semantically enriched representations and interactive analysis capabilities.

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) networks generate diverse and high-volume traffic
that reflects both normal activity and potential threats. Deriving meaningful
insight from such telemetry requires cross-layer interpretation of behaviors,
protocols, and context rather than isolated detection. This work presents an
LLM-powered AI agent framework that converts raw packet captures into
structured and semantically enriched representations for interactive analysis.
The framework integrates feature extraction, transformer-based anomaly
detection, packet and flow summarization, threat intelligence enrichment, and
retrieval-augmented question answering. An AI agent guided by a large language
model performs reasoning over the indexed traffic artifacts, assembling
evidence to produce accurate and human-readable interpretations. Experimental
evaluation on multiple IoT captures and six open models shows that hybrid
retrieval, which combines lexical and semantic search with reranking,
substantially improves BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and BERTScore results compared with
dense-only retrieval. System profiling further indicates low CPU, GPU, and
memory overhead, demonstrating that the framework achieves holistic and
efficient interpretation of IoT network traffic.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioMedSearch is a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework using LLMs that integrates literature, protein databases, and web search to handle complex biomedical queries, achieving significant accuracy improvements across three reasoning levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with scientific rigor in biomedical content, often fabricating protein functions and structural details due to inability to access authoritative databases, requiring a framework that can integrate multiple data sources for accurate biomedical reasoning.

Method: Integrates literature retrieval, protein database and web search access through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction, task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering to generate high-quality QA results.

Result: BioMedSearch consistently outperforms baseline models across all reasoning levels: Level 1 accuracy increased from 59.1% to 91.9%, Level 2 from 47.0% to 81.0%, and Level 3 from 36.3% to 73.4%.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses LLMs' limitations in biomedical reasoning by integrating multiple authoritative data sources, demonstrating substantial improvements in handling complex biomedical queries across different reasoning levels.

Abstract: Biomedical queries often rely on a deep understanding of specialized
knowledge such as gene regulatory mechanisms and pathological processes of
diseases. They require detailed analysis of complex physiological processes and
effective integration of information from multiple data sources to support
accurate retrieval and reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) perform
well in general reasoning tasks, their generated biomedical content often lacks
scientific rigor due to the inability to access authoritative biomedical
databases and frequently fabricates protein functions, interactions, and
structural details that deviate from authentic information. Therefore, we
present BioMedSearch, a multi-source biomedical information retrieval framework
based on LLMs. The method integrates literature retrieval, protein database and
web search access to support accurate and efficient handling of complex
biomedical queries. Through sub-queries decomposition, keywords extraction,
task graph construction, and multi-source information filtering, BioMedSearch
generates high-quality question-answering results. To evaluate the accuracy of
question answering, we constructed a multi-level dataset, BioMedMCQs,
consisting of 3,000 questions. The dataset covers three levels of reasoning:
mechanistic identification, non-adjacent semantic integration, and temporal
causal reasoning, and is used to assess the performance of BioMedSearch and
other methods on complex QA tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that
BioMedSearch consistently improves accuracy over all baseline models across all
levels. Specifically, at Level 1, the average accuracy increases from 59.1% to
91.9%; at Level 2, it rises from 47.0% to 81.0%; and at the most challenging
Level 3, the average accuracy improves from 36.3% to 73.4%. The code and
BioMedMCQs are available at: https://github.com/CyL-ucas/BioMed_Search

TL;DR: The LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis proposes that continual exposure to low-quality web text causes lasting cognitive decline in LLMs, with controlled experiments showing significant performance drops in reasoning, safety, and other capabilities as junk data ratio increases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether poor quality training data causally degrades LLM capabilities over time, challenging the assumption that more data is always beneficial and highlighting data quality as a training safety concern.

Method: Controlled experiments using real Twitter/X corpora with two operationalizations (engagement degree and semantic quality), constructing matched junk and control datasets, and testing 4 LLMs with gradual mixtures of junk data to observe dose-response effects.

Result: Significant cognitive decline (Hedges' g>0.3) across reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and increased dark personality traits. Thought-skipping identified as primary error mechanism. Popularity better predictor than length for brain rot effects.

Conclusion: Data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing data curation as training-time safety problem and motivating routine cognitive health monitoring for deployed models.

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk
web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To
causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X
corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal
operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with
matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the
control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes
non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context
understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy,
narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield
dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain
Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$
as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify
thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip
reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but
incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data
pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline
capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format
mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a
tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1.
Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data
quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for
continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating
routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

*Siying Liu,Shisheng Zhang,Indu Bala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show systematic biases in drug-safety prediction, with disadvantaged groups receiving higher predicted adverse event likelihoods than privileged groups, revealing both explicit and implicit bias modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographically irrelevant information into adverse event predictions, despite clinical irrelevance of such attributes.

Method: Used structured FAERS data with persona-based evaluation framework, testing ChatGPT-4o and Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B across diverse personas defined by education, marital status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion, plus three user roles.

Result: Systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy found, with disadvantaged groups assigned higher predicted AE likelihoods than privileged groups. Identified explicit bias (incorrect predictions directly reference persona attributes) and implicit bias (inconsistent predictions without explicit persona mentions).

Conclusion: Critical risks exist in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance, highlighting urgent need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before clinical deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical domains,
yet their reliability in drug-safety prediction remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs incorporate socio-demographic information
into adverse event (AE) predictions, despite such attributes being clinically
irrelevant. Using structured data from the United States Food and Drug
Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and a persona-based
evaluation framework, we assess two state-of-the-art models, ChatGPT-4o and
Bio-Medical-Llama-3.8B, across diverse personas defined by education, marital
status, employment, insurance, language, housing stability, and religion. We
further evaluate performance across three user roles (general practitioner,
specialist, patient) to reflect real-world deployment scenarios where
commercial systems often differentiate access by user type. Our results reveal
systematic disparities in AE prediction accuracy. Disadvantaged groups (e.g.,
low education, unstable housing) were frequently assigned higher predicted AE
likelihoods than more privileged groups (e.g., postgraduate-educated, privately
insured). Beyond outcome disparities, we identify two distinct modes of bias:
explicit bias, where incorrect predictions directly reference persona
attributes in reasoning traces, and implicit bias, where predictions are
inconsistent, yet personas are not explicitly mentioned. These findings expose
critical risks in applying LLMs to pharmacovigilance and highlight the urgent
need for fairness-aware evaluation protocols and mitigation strategies before
clinical deployment.

### [57] [Big Reasoning with Small Models: Instruction Retrieval at Inference Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13935)
*Kenan Alkiek,David Jurgens,Vinod Vydiswaran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Instruction retrieval improves small language models' reasoning by providing structured guidance instead of generating reasoning steps from scratch, achieving significant gains on medical, legal, and math tasks without additional fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small language models are efficient for local deployment but struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks. The goal is to enhance their reasoning capabilities without sacrificing their computational efficiency and privacy advantages.

Method: Build an Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant instructions and follows their structured reasoning steps rather than generating reasoning from scratch.

Result: Instruction retrieval yields consistent improvements: 9.4% on MedQA (medical board exams), 7.9% on MMLU Professional Law, and 5.1% on MathQA across models from 3B to 14B parameters without additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Instruction retrieval effectively enhances small language models' reasoning capabilities, with concise instructions performing best and improvement magnitude depending on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language
models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local
hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact.
Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or
domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction
intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning
procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an
Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating
instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant
instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation,
which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured
guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board
exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B
parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields
consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise
instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends
strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing literature lacks rigorous and systematic evaluation of Deep Research agents' capabilities in critical research analysis, particularly in corporate financial analysis.

Method: Proposed HisRubric framework with hierarchical analytical structure and fine-grained grading rubric that mirrors professional analyst workflow. Built FinDeepResearch benchmark and evaluated 16 methods including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs with deep reasoning+search, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning only.

Result: The experiments revealed strengths and limitations of different approaches across diverse capabilities, financial markets, and languages, providing valuable insights for future research.

Conclusion: The study addresses the evaluation gap for DR agents in financial analysis through a systematic framework and benchmark, with findings that guide future development in this domain.

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents, powered by advanced Large Language Models (LLMs),
have recently garnered increasing attention for their capability in conducting
complex research tasks. However, existing literature lacks a rigorous and
systematic evaluation of DR Agent's capabilities in critical research analysis.
To address this gap, we first propose HisRubric, a novel evaluation framework
with a hierarchical analytical structure and a fine-grained grading rubric for
rigorously assessing DR agents' capabilities in corporate financial analysis.
This framework mirrors the professional analyst's workflow, progressing from
data recognition to metric calculation, and finally to strategic summarization
and interpretation. Built on this framework, we construct a FinDeepResearch
benchmark that comprises 64 listed companies from 8 financial markets across 4
languages, encompassing a total of 15,808 grading items. We further conduct
extensive experiments on the FinDeepResearch using 16 representative methods,
including 6 DR agents, 5 LLMs equipped with both deep reasoning and search
capabilities, and 5 LLMs with deep reasoning capabilities only. The results
reveal the strengths and limitations of these approaches across diverse
capabilities, financial markets, and languages, offering valuable insights for
future research and development. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made
publicly available.

*Tuhin Chakrabarty,Jane C. Ginsburg,Paramveer Dhillon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned AI models can generate literary text that experts prefer over human-written content in both style fidelity and quality, while basic AI prompting performs poorly. This has significant implications for copyright law regarding AI training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether AI models can generate high-quality literary text that faithfully emulates authors' styles, addressing copyright concerns about AI training on copyrighted books.

Method: Preregistered study comparing MFA-trained writers with three AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) using blind pairwise evaluations by 159 expert and lay readers. Tested both in-context prompting and fine-tuning on authors' complete works.

Result: In-context prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for style and quality, but fine-tuning completely reversed this - experts preferred AI-generated text. Fine-tuned outputs were rarely detected as AI (3% vs 97% for prompting) and cost only $81 per author.

Conclusion: Author-specific fine-tuning enables AI to produce non-verbatim writing that readers prefer to expert human writing, providing empirical evidence relevant to copyright's fair-use analysis of market impact.

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous
lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative
content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality
literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a
preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI
models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating
50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159
representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context
prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity
(OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results
with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete
works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text
for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010),
with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across
authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated
(3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation
analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable
AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs.
While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to
transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median
fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7%
reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific
fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert
human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's
fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the
source works.

TL;DR: MTI is a training-free framework that improves reasoning accuracy by selectively applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain token positions, achieving consistent gains across various tasks with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM scaling approaches improve reasoning but sacrifice efficiency. The authors discovered that reasoning uncertainty is highly localized to only a small subset of high-entropy tokens that dominantly affect output correctness.

Method: MTI includes: (1) Selective CFG intervention - applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; (2) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance - reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently.

Result: MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks: +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning, while remaining highly efficient.

Conclusion: MTI demonstrates that targeted interventions at uncertain token positions can significantly improve reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal computational overhead, offering an efficient alternative to brute-force test-time scaling.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time
scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at
the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet
underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a
small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness.
Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a
training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with
minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying
classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight
negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate
unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general,
coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for
Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining
highly efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding the range of errors in real-world RAG systems is crucial for robust deployment, as these complex systems have many potential causes for erroneous outputs.

Method: Developed a taxonomy of RAG error types, curated a dataset of erroneous RAG responses with error type annotations, and proposed an auto-evaluation method aligned with the taxonomy.

Result: Created a comprehensive classification system for RAG errors and provided practical advice for addressing them, along with a dataset and evaluation framework.

Conclusion: The proposed taxonomy, dataset, and auto-evaluation method provide practical tools for developers to identify, track, and address errors in RAG systems during development and deployment.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a prevalent approach for building
LLM-based question-answering systems that can take advantage of external
knowledge databases. Due to the complexity of real-world RAG systems, there are
many potential causes for erroneous outputs. Understanding the range of errors
that can occur in practice is crucial for robust deployment. We present a new
taxonomy of the error types that can occur in realistic RAG systems, examples
of each, and practical advice for addressing them. Additionally, we curate a
dataset of erroneous RAG responses annotated by error types. We then propose an
auto-evaluation method aligned with our taxonomy that can be used in practice
to track and address errors during development. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: The German Commons is the largest collection of openly licensed German text (154.56B tokens) from 41 sources across 7 domains, enabling development of truly open German language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical scarcity of openly licensed German text for LLM development, as most training corpora contain data of unclear licensing status, especially problematic for non-English languages.

Method: Systematic sourcing from 41 established data providers with verifiable licensing, followed by comprehensive processing pipeline including quality filtering, deduplication, and text formatting fixes across 7 domains (legal, scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, web).

Result: Created 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality German text with licenses of at least CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and redistribution.

Conclusion: The German Commons fills the critical gap in openly licensed German pretraining data and enables development of truly open German language models, with released code making the corpus fully reproducible and extensible.

Abstract: Large language model development relies on large-scale training corpora, yet
most contain data of unclear licensing status, limiting the development of
truly open models. This problem is exacerbated for non-English languages, where
openly licensed text remains critically scarce. We introduce the German
Commons, the largest collection of openly licensed German text to date. It
compiles data from 41 sources across seven domains, encompassing legal,
scientific, cultural, political, news, economic, and web text. Through
systematic sourcing from established data providers with verifiable licensing,
it yields 154.56 billion tokens of high-quality text for language model
training. Our processing pipeline implements comprehensive quality filtering,
deduplication, and text formatting fixes, ensuring consistent quality across
heterogeneous text sources. All domain subsets feature licenses of at least
CC-BY-SA 4.0 or equivalent, ensuring legal compliance for model training and
redistribution. The German Commons therefore addresses the critical gap in
openly licensed German pretraining data, and enables the development of truly
open German language models. We also release code for corpus construction and
data filtering tailored to German language text, rendering the German Commons
fully reproducible and extensible.

TL;DR: CRaFT is an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' cross-cultural reasoning through four metrics, revealing that cultural awareness emerges through linguistic framing rather than being intrinsic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Correct answers alone don't reflect cultural understanding, so there's a need to evaluate how LLMs reason across cultural contexts beyond just accuracy.

Method: Used CRaFT framework with four metrics (Cultural Fluency, Deviation, Consistency, Linguistic Adaptation) on 50 culturally grounded questions from World Values Survey translated into Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, evaluating three models across 2,100+ answer-explanation pairs.

Result: Significant cross-lingual variation: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances it, Spanish remains stable. GPT adapts better across languages but has lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid reasoning.

Conclusion: Cultural awareness in LLMs is not intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT provides a new evaluation lens for cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Correct answers do not necessarily reflect cultural understanding. We
introduce CRaFT, an explanation-based multilingual evaluation framework
designed to assess how large language models (LLMs) reason across cultural
contexts. Rather than scoring outputs solely based on accuracy, CRaFT evaluates
model explanations using four interpretable metrics: Cultural Fluency,
Deviation, Consistency, and Linguistic Adaptation. We apply the framework to 50
culturally grounded questions from the World Values Survey, translated into
Arabic, Bengali, and Spanish, and evaluate three models (GPT, DeepSeek, and
FANAR) across over 2,100 answer-explanation pairs. Results reveal significant
cross-lingual variation in reasoning: Arabic reduces fluency, Bengali enhances
it, and Spanish remains largely stable. While GPT adapts more effectively
across languages, it exhibits lower consistency; FANAR shows stable but rigid
reasoning. These findings suggest that cultural awareness in LLMs is not
intrinsic but emerges through linguistic framing. CRaFT offers a new lens for
evaluating cross-cultural reasoning in multilingual settings, providing
actionable insights for building culturally adaptive language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces GlobalGroup, an abstract reasoning task across multiple languages to evaluate linguistic biases in LLMs, finding English modalities generally perform better.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation of linguistic biases in abstract reasoning tasks, where previous works focused on reasoning tasks with formulaic approaches like commonsense or math.

Method: Proposed GlobalGroup task inspired by NYT Connections, constructed benchmark with 5 languages (English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, Arabic) in both native and English translations, with game difficulty measurements for controlled comparison.

Result: English modalities largely lead to better performance in abstract reasoning, with performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

Conclusion: The study reveals significant linguistic biases in LLMs' abstract reasoning capabilities, with English showing advantage, and highlights the importance of cross-lingual evaluation in reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due
to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus
another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through
reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success,
such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to
reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to
identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic
approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this
task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times
Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task
across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic
backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the
native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed
game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar
difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly
important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English
modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task,
and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate systematic relationships between phonetics and semantics at scale, testing whether previously observed phonosemantic patterns manifest quantitatively across diverse languages.

Method: Distributional approach analyzing alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic similarity spaces using statistical measures across English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil.

Result: Discovered new interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified, found crosslinguistic patterns, and obtained mixed support for 5 previously hypothesized alignments.

Conclusion: Systematic phonosemantic relationships exist at scale across diverse languages, with both novel alignments and partial validation of existing hypotheses.

Abstract: Language is, as commonly theorized, largely arbitrary. Yet, systematic
relationships between phonetics and semantics have been observed in many
specific cases. To what degree could those systematic relationships manifest
themselves in large scale, quantitative investigations--both in previously
identified and unidentified phenomena? This work undertakes a distributional
approach to quantifying phonosemantic iconicity at scale across 6 diverse
languages (English, Spanish, Hindi, Finnish, Turkish, and Tamil). In each
language, we analyze the alignment of morphemes' phonetic and semantic
similarity spaces with a suite of statistical measures, and discover an array
of interpretable phonosemantic alignments not previously identified in the
literature, along with crosslinguistic patterns. We also analyze 5 previously
hypothesized phonosemantic alignments, finding support for some such alignments
and mixed results for others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for Generation Optimization) uses Shannon entropy over next token distributions to detect uncertainty spikes in multi-turn LLM conversations, triggering adaptive prompt consolidation to improve performance by 56.6% and reliability by 35.3%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer significant performance degradation in multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally, which poses a severe challenge to real-world usability of conversational AI systems.

Method: ERGO continuously quantifies internal uncertainty via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected, treating uncertainty as a signal rather than a nuisance.

Result: ERGO yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability (variability in performance) by 35.3% in multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware interventions like ERGO can significantly improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI by dynamically realigning conversational context based on uncertainty signals.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer significant performance degradation in
multi-turn conversations when information is presented incrementally. Given
that multi-turn conversations characterize everyday interactions with LLMs,
this degradation poses a severe challenge to real world usability. We
hypothesize that abrupt increases in model uncertainty signal misalignment in
multi-turn LLM interactions, and we exploit this insight to dynamically realign
conversational context. We introduce ERGO (Entropy-guided Resetting for
Generation Optimization), which continuously quantifies internal uncertainty
via Shannon entropy over next token distributions and triggers adaptive prompt
consolidation when a sharp spike in entropy is detected. By treating
uncertainty as a first class signal rather than a nuisance to eliminate, ERGO
embraces variability in language and modeling, representing and responding to
uncertainty. In multi-turn tasks with incrementally revealed instructions, ERGO
yields a 56.6% average performance gain over standard baselines, increases
aptitude (peak performance capability) by 24.7%, and decreases unreliability
(variability in performance) by 35.3%, demonstrating that uncertainty aware
interventions can improve both accuracy and reliability in conversational AI.

TL;DR: DROID is a compact dual-encoder framework for out-of-scope intent detection that combines universal and domain-specific representations with simple calibration, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for out-of-scope intent detection often rely on strong distributional assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules, which can be limiting for practical deployment in task-oriented dialogue systems.

Method: Combines Universal Sentence Encoder for broad semantic generalization and domain-adapted Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder for domain-specific distinctions, with fused representations processed by a lightweight branched classifier using a single calibrated threshold.

Result: Outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6-15% for known intents and 8-20% for OOS intents, with most significant gains in low-resource settings using only 1.5M parameters.

Conclusion: Dual-encoder representations with simple calibration can yield robust, scalable, and reliable out-of-scope detection for neural dialogue systems without complex post-processing.

Abstract: Detecting out-of-scope (OOS) user utterances remains a key challenge in
task-oriented dialogue systems and, more broadly, in open-set intent
recognition. Existing approaches often depend on strong distributional
assumptions or auxiliary calibration modules. We present DROID (Dual
Representation for Out-of-Scope Intent Detection), a compact end-to-end
framework that combines two complementary encoders -- the Universal Sentence
Encoder (USE) for broad semantic generalization and a domain-adapted
Transformer-based Denoising Autoencoder (TSDAE) for domain-specific contextual
distinctions. Their fused representations are processed by a lightweight
branched classifier with a single calibrated threshold that separates in-domain
and OOS intents without post-hoc scoring. To enhance boundary learning under
limited supervision, DROID incorporates both synthetic and open-domain outlier
augmentation. Despite using only 1.5M trainable parameters, DROID consistently
outperforms recent state-of-the-art baselines across multiple intent
benchmarks, achieving macro-F1 improvements of 6--15% for known and 8--20% for
OOS intents, with the most significant gains in low-resource settings. These
results demonstrate that dual-encoder representations with simple calibration
can yield robust, scalable, and reliable OOS detection for neural dialogue
systems.

TL;DR: CyberPal 2.0 is a family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (4B-20B parameters) trained on enriched chain-of-thought cybersecurity instruction data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on cybersecurity tasks while being much smaller than frontier models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployment of LLMs in cybersecurity lags due to lack of high-quality, domain-specific models and training datasets, creating a gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Created CyberPal 2.0 SLMs using SecKnowledge 2.0 pipeline for data enrichment and formatting, integrating expert-in-the-loop steering of reasoning formats with LLM-driven multi-step grounding to generate high-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces.

Result: CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier models despite being much smaller. On cyber threat intelligence tasks, it ranks second only to Sec-Gemini v1. On threat-investigation tasks, the 20B model outperforms GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, and Sec-Gemini v1 (ranking first), while the 4B model ranks second.

Conclusion: CyberPal 2.0 demonstrates that specialized small language models can achieve state-of-the-art performance in cybersecurity domains through high-quality, domain-specific training data and expert-guided reasoning formats.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet
deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific
models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a
family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B
parameters. To train CyberPal 2.0, we generate an enriched chain-of-thought
cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting
pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of
reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding
higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across
diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its
baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier
models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat
intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier
models, ranking second only to Sec-Gemini v1. On core threat-investigation
tasks, such as correlating vulnerabilities and bug tickets with weaknesses, our
best 20B-parameter model outperforms GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, and Sec-Gemini v1,
ranking first, while our smallest 4B-parameter model ranks second.

*Darko Sasanski,Dimitar Peshevski,Riste Stojanov,Dimitar Trajanov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: First systematic construction of a Macedonian recipe dataset through web scraping and structured parsing, with analysis of ingredient patterns in Macedonian cuisine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Macedonian recipes are under-represented in digital research despite the importance of diverse recipe datasets for computational gastronomy and capturing regional culinary traditions.

Method: Web scraping and structured parsing of Macedonian recipes, with normalization of heterogeneous ingredient descriptions (units, quantities, descriptors), and exploratory analysis using Pointwise Mutual Information and Lift score for ingredient co-occurrence patterns.

Result: Created the first Macedonian recipe dataset and identified distinctive ingredient combinations that characterize Macedonian cuisine through frequency and co-occurrence analysis.

Conclusion: The dataset provides a valuable resource for studying food culture in underrepresented languages and reveals unique patterns in Macedonian culinary tradition.

Abstract: Computational gastronomy increasingly relies on diverse, high-quality recipe
datasets to capture regional culinary traditions. Although there are
large-scale collections for major languages, Macedonian recipes remain
under-represented in digital research. In this work, we present the first
systematic effort to construct a Macedonian recipe dataset through web scraping
and structured parsing. We address challenges in processing heterogeneous
ingredient descriptions, including unit, quantity, and descriptor
normalization. An exploratory analysis of ingredient frequency and
co-occurrence patterns, using measures such as Pointwise Mutual Information and
Lift score, highlights distinctive ingredient combinations that characterize
Macedonian cuisine. The resulting dataset contributes a new resource for
studying food culture in underrepresented languages and offers insights into
the unique patterns of Macedonian culinary tradition.

### [70] [RLSR: Reinforcement Learning with Supervised Reward Outperforms SFT in Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14200)
*Zhichao Wang,Andy Wong,Ruslan Belkin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLSR replaces SFT with RL-based approach using semantic similarity rewards, achieving better instruction-following performance than SFT alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage extensive SFT datasets in RL framework for improving base model's instruction-following ability, inspired by RFT's RL-based domain adaptation approach.

Method: RLSR generates multiple responses per prompt, computes reward scores as cosine similarity in semantic embedding space between generated and human-labeled responses, and can be used to replace SFT or combined with it.

Result: RLSR alone achieved 26.34% AlpacaEval win rate vs SFT's 21.01% on Qwen-7B; combined SFT+RLSR achieved 30.73% win rate, showing superior performance on instruction-following benchmarks.

Conclusion: RLSR effectively improves instruction-following ability and can replace or complement SFT, demonstrating the value of RL-based approaches using semantic similarity rewards.

Abstract: After the pretraining stage of LLMs, techniques such as SFT, RLHF, RLVR, and
RFT are applied to enhance instruction-following ability, mitigate undesired
responses, improve reasoning capability and enable efficient domain adaptation
with minimal data. SFT relies on the next-token prediction objective to
strengthen instruction following in a base model using a large corpus of
human-labeled responses. In contrast, RFT employs a RL-based approach to adapt
fine-tuned reasoning models to specific domains with limited supervision.
Inspired by RFT, we propose replacing SFT with RLSR to leverage the extensive
SFT dataset in an RL framework, thereby improving the base model's
instruction-following ability. In RLSR, the base model generates multiple
responses for each prompt, and reward scores are computed as the cosine
similarity in the semantic embedding space between the generated and
human-labeled responses. RLSR can be utilized in multiple ways. It can directly
replace SFT, achieving superior performance on instruction-following
benchmarks-for example, RLSR (SB) on Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved an AlpacaEval
win rate of 26.34%, surpassing SFT's 21.01%. Furthermore, combining SFT and
RLSR further enhances downstream task performance; Qwen-7B (INFINITY) achieved
a win rate of 30.73% when trained with SFT + RLSR.

*Bingsheng Yao,Bo Sun,Yuanzhe Dong,Yuxuan Lu,Dakuo Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DPRF is a framework that iteratively refines persona profiles for LLM role-playing agents to improve behavioral alignment with target individuals through cognitive divergence analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM role-playing agents suffer from poor persona fidelity due to manually-created profiles that aren't validated for alignment with target individuals.

Method: Dynamic Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF) that iteratively identifies cognitive divergence between generated behaviors and human ground truth, then refines persona profiles to mitigate these divergences using free-form or theory-grounded structured analysis.

Result: DPRF consistently improves behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas and generalizes across five LLMs and four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios (formal debates, social media posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews).

Conclusion: DPRF provides a robust methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the validity of downstream applications like user simulation, social studies, and personalized AI.

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to
simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often
undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and
personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target
individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic
Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM
RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the
cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured
analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the
persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs
on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media
posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can
consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas
and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust
methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the
validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies,
and personalized AI.

### [72] [LiteStage: Latency-aware Layer Skipping for Multi-stage Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14211)
*Beomseok Kang,Jiwon Song,Jae-Joon Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiteStage is a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning that combines stage-wise offline layer budget allocation with online confidence-based early exit to accelerate small language models while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-stage reasoning improves small language models' reasoning capability but increases latency. Existing adaptive acceleration techniques like layer skipping struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy due to stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity and redundant output token generation.

Method: Proposes LiteStage framework with two components: (1) stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer budgets for each reasoning stage, and (2) online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress unnecessary decoding.

Result: Experiments on OBQA, CSQA, and StrategyQA benchmarks show LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than 4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

Conclusion: LiteStage effectively addresses the latency-accuracy trade-off in multi-stage reasoning by combining offline layer budget optimization with online early exit, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing acceleration techniques.

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the
reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems
into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased
latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as
layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due
to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2)
the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose
LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning.
LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer
budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress
unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and
StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than
4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

### [73] [Flip-Flop Consistency: Unsupervised Training for Robustness to Prompt Perturbations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14242)
*Parsa Hejabi,Elnaz Rahmati,Alireza S. Ziabari,Morteza Dehghani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flip-Flop Consistency (F²C) is an unsupervised training method that improves LLM robustness to prompt perturbations using consensus cross-entropy and representation alignment to reduce inconsistent answers across different phrasings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often produce inconsistent answers when faced with different phrasings of the same prompt, which reduces reliability and robustness.

Method: F²C uses two components: Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE) creates hard pseudo-labels via majority vote across prompt variations, and a representation alignment loss pulls lower-confidence predictors toward the consensus.

Result: On 11 datasets across 4 NLP tasks, F²C increased agreement by 11.62%, improved mean F1 by 8.94%, and reduced performance variance by 3.29%. It also showed strong generalization in out-of-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: F²C is an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce inconsistent answers when faced
with different phrasings of the same prompt. In this paper, we propose
Flip-Flop Consistency ($F^2C$), an unsupervised training method that improves
robustness to such perturbations. $F^2C$ is composed of two key components. The
first, Consensus Cross-Entropy (CCE), uses a majority vote across prompt
variations to create a hard pseudo-label. The second is a representation
alignment loss that pulls lower-confidence and non-majority predictors toward
the consensus established by high-confidence, majority-voting variations. We
evaluate our method on 11 datasets spanning four NLP tasks, with 4-15 prompt
variations per dataset. On average, $F^2C$ raises observed agreement by 11.62%,
improves mean $F_1$ by 8.94%, and reduces performance variance across formats
by 3.29%. In out-of-domain evaluations, $F^2C$ generalizes effectively,
increasing $\overline{F_1}$ and agreement while decreasing variance across most
source-target pairs. Finally, when trained on only a subset of prompt
perturbations and evaluated on held-out formats, $F^2C$ consistently improves
both performance and agreement while reducing variance. These findings
highlight $F^2C$ as an effective unsupervised method for enhancing LLM
consistency, performance, and generalization under prompt perturbations. Code

*Jihao Zhao,Zhiyuan Ji,Simin Niu,Hanyu Wang,Feiyu Xiong,Zhiyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes MoM framework that transforms RAG from passive chunking to proactive document memory extraction, enabling SLMs to acquire human-like reading abilities through structured chunking, multi-path evaluation, and reverse reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RAG systems are limited by passive text chunking, which restricts knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. The research aims to simulate human cognitive processes during reading by proactively extracting document memories.

Method: Proposes Mixtures of scenario-aware document Memories (MoM) framework that: 1) Uses LLMs to generate document logical outlines for structured chunking, 2) Employs multi-path sampling with comprehensive metrics for optimal memory selection, 3) Incorporates reverse reasoning to deduce expert thinking paths, 4) Develops three-layer document memory retrieval mechanism.

Result: Extensive experiments across three domains show MoM resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, provides LLMs with semantically complete document memories, and enables SLMs to achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

Conclusion: The MoM framework successfully transforms RAG from passive chunking to proactive understanding, paving the way for SLMs to acquire human-like reading and reasoning capabilities through structured document memory extraction.

Abstract: The traditional RAG paradigm, which typically engages in the comprehension of
relevant text chunks in response to received queries, inherently restricts both
the depth of knowledge internalization and reasoning capabilities. To address
this limitation, our research transforms the text processing in RAG from
passive chunking to proactive understanding, defining this process as document
memory extraction with the objective of simulating human cognitive processes
during reading. Building upon this, we propose the Mixtures of scenario-aware
document Memories (MoM) framework, engineered to efficiently handle documents
from multiple domains and train small language models (SLMs) to acquire the
ability to proactively explore and construct document memories. The MoM
initially instructs large language models (LLMs) to simulate domain experts in
generating document logical outlines, thereby directing structured chunking and
core content extraction. It employs a multi-path sampling and multi-perspective
evaluation mechanism, specifically designing comprehensive metrics that
represent chunk clarity and extraction completeness to select the optimal
document memories. Additionally, to infuse deeper human-like reading abilities
during the training of SLMs, we incorporate a reverse reasoning strategy, which
deduces refined expert thinking paths from high-quality outcomes. Finally,
leveraging diverse forms of content generated by MoM, we develop a three-layer
document memory retrieval mechanism, which is grounded in our theoretical proof
from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Extensive experimental results
across three distinct domains demonstrate that the MoM framework not only
resolves text chunking challenges in existing RAG systems, providing LLMs with
semantically complete document memories, but also paves the way for SLMs to
achieve human-centric intelligent text processing.

*Rahul Nadkarni,Yanai Elazar,Hila Gonen,Noah A. Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents an experimental method for studying how training data affects language model behavior by intervening on data batches and retraining models to test data-behavior relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the relationship between training data and language model behavior, moving beyond observational analyses to experimental interventions.

Method: A recipe involving: 1) selecting evaluation items from benchmarks, 2) matching relevant documents to those items, 3) modifying documents, 4) retraining model checkpoints, and 5) measuring effects. Uses cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval to identify relevant training documents.

Result: Case studies show that cooccurrence statistics link to model behavior, but current methods for identifying relevant training documents don't fully explain models' ability to answer knowledge questions correctly.

Conclusion: The proposed experimental recipe enables researchers to systematically test hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior, with code made publicly available for future work.

Abstract: We present an experimental recipe for studying the relationship between
training data and language model (LM) behavior. We outline steps for
intervening on data batches -- i.e., ``rewriting history'' -- and then
retraining model checkpoints over that data to test hypotheses relating data to
behavior. Our recipe breaks down such an intervention into stages that include
selecting evaluation items from a benchmark that measures model behavior,
matching relevant documents to those items, and modifying those documents
before retraining and measuring the effects. We demonstrate the utility of our
recipe through case studies on factual knowledge acquisition in LMs, using both
cooccurrence statistics and information retrieval methods to identify documents
that might contribute to knowledge learning. Our results supplement past
observational analyses that link cooccurrence to model behavior, while
demonstrating that extant methods for identifying relevant training documents
do not fully explain an LM's ability to correctly answer knowledge questions.
Overall, we outline a recipe that researchers can follow to test further
hypotheses about how training data affects model behavior. Our code is made
publicly available to promote future work.

### [76] [Less is More: Denoising Knowledge Graphs For Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14271)
*Yilun Zheng,Dan Yang,Jie Li,Lin Shang,Lihui Chen,Jiahao Xu,Sitao Luan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DEG-RAG is a framework that denoises LLM-generated knowledge graphs through entity resolution and triple reflection, improving Graph-based RAG performance by creating more compact, higher-quality KGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Graph-based RAG systems rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, which often produces noisy KGs with redundant entities and unreliable relationships, degrading retrieval and generation performance while increasing computational costs.

Method: DEG-RAG uses two main techniques: (1) entity resolution to eliminate redundant entities, and (2) triple reflection to remove erroneous relations. The framework systematically evaluates entity resolution with different blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging techniques.

Result: The approach drastically reduces graph size and consistently improves question answering performance across diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants. This is the first comprehensive exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs.

Conclusion: DEG-RAG effectively addresses the denoising problem in LLM-generated knowledge graphs, yielding more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform unprocessed counterparts in Graph-based RAG systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models
(LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process,
demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges
such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff.
Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs
(KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential
responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems
rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with
redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval
and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially,
current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for
LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for
Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these
challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities,
and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these
techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform
their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different
blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging
techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments
demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces
graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across
diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

*Lifu Tu,Yingbo Zhou,Semih Yavuz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Small multilingual models lag behind larger ones in retrieval tasks. This work investigates how to retrofit smaller models for better retrieval performance by optimizing training data scale, negative sampling, and data diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small multilingual models (<1B parameters) perform well on general tasks but consistently underperform larger models (>1B) in retrieval tasks, raising the question of whether smaller models can be specifically optimized for retrieval.

Method: Investigated key factors influencing multilingual embedding effectiveness: training data scale, negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. Found that hard negatives are essential and task diversity matters more than language diversity alone.

Result: Developed a compact ~300M parameter multilingual model that achieves retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B models.

Conclusion: Smaller models can be effectively retrofitted for retrieval tasks through strategic optimization of training factors, particularly incorporating hard negatives and focusing on task diversity rather than just language diversity.

Abstract: Training effective multilingual embedding models presents unique challenges
due to the diversity of languages and task objectives. Although small
multilingual models (<1 B parameters) perform well on multilingual tasks
generally, they consistently lag behind larger models (>1 B) in the most
prevalent use case: retrieval. This raises a critical question: Can smaller
models be retrofitted specifically for retrieval tasks to enhance their
performance? In this work, we investigate key factors that influence the
effectiveness of multilingual embeddings, focusing on training data scale,
negative sampling strategies, and data diversity. We find that while increasing
the scale of training data yields initial performance gains, these improvements
quickly plateau - indicating diminishing returns. Incorporating hard negatives
proves essential for consistently improving retrieval accuracy. Furthermore,
our analysis reveals that task diversity in the training data contributes more
significantly to performance than language diversity alone. As a result, we
develop a compact (approximately 300M) multilingual model that achieves
retrieval performance comparable to or even surpassing current strong 7B
models.

TL;DR: Qwen3Guard introduces specialized safety guardrail models with two variants: Generative for fine-grained safety classification and Stream for real-time monitoring during LLM generation, supporting 119 languages and achieving SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing safety guardrail models have limitations: they only provide binary safe/unsafe labels (inconsistent across policies) and require complete outputs (incompatible with streaming inference), preventing timely intervention.

Method: Developed two specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard casts safety classification as instruction-following for tri-class judgments; Stream Qwen3Guard uses token-level classification for real-time monitoring during incremental generation. Available in three sizes (0.6B, 4B, 8B) supporting 119 languages.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks for both prompt and response safety classification. Provides comprehensive, scalable, low-latency safety moderation.

Conclusion: Qwen3Guard addresses key limitations of existing safety models by enabling fine-grained classification and real-time streaming safety monitoring, making it suitable for global LLM deployments. Released under Apache 2.0 license.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more capable and widely used, ensuring
the safety of their outputs is increasingly critical. Existing guardrail
models, though useful in static evaluation settings, face two major limitations
in real-world applications: (1) they typically output only binary "safe/unsafe"
labels, which can be interpreted inconsistently across diverse safety policies,
rendering them incapable of accommodating varying safety tolerances across
domains; and (2) they require complete model outputs before performing safety
checks, making them fundamentally incompatible with streaming LLM inference,
thereby preventing timely intervention during generation and increasing
exposure to harmful partial outputs. To address these challenges, we present
Qwen3Guard, a series of multilingual safety guardrail models with two
specialized variants: Generative Qwen3Guard, which casts safety classification
as an instruction-following task to enable fine-grained tri-class judgments
(safe, controversial, unsafe); and Stream Qwen3Guard, which introduces a
token-level classification head for real-time safety monitoring during
incremental text generation. Both variants are available in three sizes (0.6B,
4B, and 8B parameters) and support up to 119 languages and dialects, providing
comprehensive, scalable, and low-latency safety moderation for global LLM
deployments. Evaluated across English, Chinese, and multilingual benchmarks,
Qwen3Guard achieves state-of-the-art performance in both prompt and response
safety classification. All models are released under the Apache 2.0 license for
public use.

TL;DR: An Agentic Retrieval System using LLMs in a structured loop with three specialized agents (Question Analyzer, Selector, Adder) for multi-hop QA, achieving high precision and recall while filtering distracting content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval is central to multi-hop QA where complex questions require gathering multiple evidence pieces. Current approaches need better precision and recall in evidence retrieval.

Method: Three-agent framework: Question Analyzer decomposes questions into sub-questions, Selector identifies relevant context (precision-focused), Adder brings missing evidence (recall-focused), with iterative interaction between Selector and Adder.

Result: Achieves higher retrieval accuracy while filtering distracting content, enabling downstream QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy with less irrelevant information. Outperforms baselines on four multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The agentic retrieval system effectively balances precision and recall through specialized agents and iterative refinement, significantly improving multi-hop QA performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where
answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We
introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models
(LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision
and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question
Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector
that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on
precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on
recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact
yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher
retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream
QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on
significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA
benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG --
demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats schema linking as a standalone problem, combining table-first and column-first retrieval strategies with question decomposition techniques to improve Text-to-SQL accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Schema linking is a critical but underexplored component of Text-to-SQL systems, where current methods focus on SQL generation but neglect schema element retrieval, leading to hallucinations and execution failures.

Method: Proposes a bidirectional schema retrieval framework with two complementary strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and column-first retrieval followed by table selection, augmented with question decomposition, keyword extraction, and keyphrase extraction.

Result: Significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives on BIRD and Spider benchmarks. SQL generation using retrieved schema outperforms full-schema baselines and approaches oracle performance, narrowing the performance gap between full and perfect schema settings by 50%.

Conclusion: Schema linking is a powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency, and treating it as a standalone problem with bidirectional retrieval strategies yields substantial improvements.

Abstract: Schema linking -- the process of aligning natural language questions with
database schema elements -- is a critical yet underexplored component of
Text-to-SQL systems. While recent methods have focused primarily on improving
SQL generation, they often neglect the retrieval of relevant schema elements,
which can lead to hallucinations and execution failures. In this work, we
propose a context-aware bidirectional schema retrieval framework that treats
schema linking as a standalone problem. Our approach combines two complementary
strategies: table-first retrieval followed by column selection, and
column-first retrieval followed by table selection. It is further augmented
with techniques such as question decomposition, keyword extraction, and
keyphrase extraction. Through comprehensive evaluations on challenging
benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider, we demonstrate that our method
significantly improves schema recall while reducing false positives. Moreover,
SQL generation using our retrieved schema consistently outperforms full-schema
baselines and closely approaches oracle performance, all without requiring
query refinement. Notably, our method narrows the performance gap between full
and perfect schema settings by 50\%. Our findings highlight schema linking as a
powerful lever for enhancing Text-to-SQL accuracy and efficiency.

*Ziye Xia,Sergei S. Ospichev*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a prompt engineering-based method for analyzing key concept paths in academic papers using small language models and knowledge graph constraints, achieving improved accuracy in concept extraction and innovation identification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of academic publications makes it difficult for scientists to track research findings. Existing paper databases only perform basic concept matching and classification, lacking deep exploration of relational networks between concepts.

Method: Based on OpenAlex knowledge graph, the method uses prompt engineering with small language models for precise key concept extraction and innovation point identification. It employs an agent with knowledge graph constraint mechanism and fine-tunes Qwen and DeepSeek models.

Result: Analysis of 8,000 papers from Novosibirsk State University revealed strong correlation between concept path distribution patterns and innovation/rare paths. The fine-tuned models achieved significant accuracy improvements and are available on Hugging Face.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses limitations of existing paper analysis systems by enabling deeper exploration of concept relationships and improving automated key concept extraction and innovation identification.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid increase in academic publications across various
fields has posed severe challenges for academic paper analysis: scientists
struggle to timely and comprehensively track the latest research findings and
methodologies. Key concept extraction has proven to be an effective analytical
paradigm, and its automation has been achieved with the widespread application
of language models in industrial and scientific domains. However, existing
paper databases are mostly limited to similarity matching and basic
classification of key concepts, failing to deeply explore the relational
networks between concepts. This paper is based on the OpenAlex opensource
knowledge graph. By analyzing nearly 8,000 open-source paper data from
Novosibirsk State University, we discovered a strong correlation between the
distribution patterns of paper key concept paths and both innovation points and
rare paths. We propose a prompt engineering-based key concept path analysis
method. This method leverages small language models to achieve precise key
concept extraction and innovation point identification, and constructs an agent
based on a knowledge graph constraint mechanism to enhance analysis accuracy.
Through fine-tuning of the Qwen and DeepSeek models, we achieved significant
improvements in accuracy, with the models publicly available on the Hugging
Face platform.

TL;DR: MathMist is a parallel multilingual benchmark for mathematical reasoning with 21K aligned question-answer pairs across 7 languages, revealing LLMs' persistent deficiencies in cross-lingual mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks focus primarily on English or high-resource languages, leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Method: Created MathMist benchmark with aligned question-answer pairs across 7 languages covering high-, medium-, and low-resource settings. Evaluated diverse models including open-source, proprietary, and multilingual-focused LLMs under zero-shot, chain-of-thought, and code-switched reasoning paradigms.

Result: Results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced degradation in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: LLMs struggle with consistent mathematical reasoning across languages, particularly in low-resource settings, highlighting the need for improved multilingual mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning remains one of the most challenging domains for large
language models (LLMs), requiring not only linguistic understanding but also
structured logical deduction and numerical precision. While recent LLMs
demonstrate strong general-purpose reasoning abilities, their mathematical
competence across diverse languages remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks
primarily focus on English or a narrow subset of high-resource languages,
leaving significant gaps in assessing multilingual and cross-lingual
mathematical reasoning. To address this, we introduce MathMist, a parallel
multilingual benchmark for mathematical problem solving and reasoning. MathMist
encompasses over 21K aligned question-answer pairs across seven languages,
representing a balanced coverage of high-, medium-, and low-resource linguistic
settings. The dataset captures linguistic variety, multiple types of problem
settings, and solution synthesizing capabilities. We systematically evaluate a
diverse suite of models, including open-source small and medium LLMs,
proprietary systems, and multilingual-reasoning-focused models, under
zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and code-switched reasoning paradigms. Our
results reveal persistent deficiencies in LLMs' ability to perform consistent
and interpretable mathematical reasoning across languages, with pronounced
degradation in low-resource settings. All the codes and data are available at

TL;DR: MERLIN is a new testbed for Multilingual Multimodal Entity Linking with a dataset of BBC news articles in 5 languages (Hindi, Japanese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Tamil) containing 7,000+ entity mentions linked to 2,500 Wikidata entities, showing that visual data improves entity linking accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of entity linking when textual context is ambiguous or insufficient, particularly for models with limited multilingual capabilities, by incorporating visual data alongside text.

Method: Created a dataset with BBC news article titles and corresponding images in 5 languages, then benchmarked using multilingual and multimodal entity linking methods with language models like LLaMa-2 and Aya-23.

Result: Visual data incorporation improves entity linking accuracy, especially for entities with ambiguous textual context and for models with weaker multilingual abilities.

Conclusion: Multimodal approaches combining visual and textual data enhance entity linking performance, particularly in multilingual settings where text alone may be insufficient.

Abstract: This paper introduces MERLIN, a novel testbed system for the task of
Multilingual Multimodal Entity Linking. The created dataset includes BBC news
article titles, paired with corresponding images, in five languages: Hindi,
Japanese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, and Tamil, featuring over 7,000 named entity
mentions linked to 2,500 unique Wikidata entities. We also include several
benchmarks using multilingual and multimodal entity linking methods exploring
different language models like LLaMa-2 and Aya-23. Our findings indicate that
incorporating visual data improves the accuracy of entity linking, especially
for entities where the textual context is ambiguous or insufficient, and
particularly for models that do not have strong multilingual abilities. For the

### [84] [Evaluating & Reducing Deceptive Dialogue From Language Models with Multi-turn RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14318)
*Marwa Abdulhai,Ryan Cheng,Aryansh Shrivastava,Natasha Jaques,Yarin Gal,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit deceptive behavior in ~26% of dialogue turns even with benign prompts, and can increase deception by 31% when prompted to deceive. RLHF-trained models still show 43% deception rates. A new belief misalignment metric better correlates with human judgments than existing metrics, and multi-turn reinforcement learning reduces deception by 77.6%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs' ability to produce deceptive outputs poses significant safety concerns in real-world applications like customer support, education and healthcare. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination and misinformation makes their misuse a serious risk.

Method: Proposed belief misalignment metric to quantify deception, evaluated across four dialogue scenarios using five established deception detection metrics plus the new metric. Introduced multi-turn reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive behaviors.

Result: Belief misalignment metric correlates more closely with human judgments than existing metrics. LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive behavior in ~26% of dialogue turns, increasing to 31% when prompted to deceive. RLHF-trained models show 43% deception rates. Multi-turn reinforcement learning reduces deception by 77.6% compared to other instruction-tuned models.

Conclusion: Deception in dialogue develops over interaction history, requiring multi-turn analysis rather than single-utterance approaches. The proposed belief misalignment metric and multi-turn reinforcement learning methodology effectively quantify and reduce deceptive behaviors in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in
applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their
ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently,
poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior,
combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation,
and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this
paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within
dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We
evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five
established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings
reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human
judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of
eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive
behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with
seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of
increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly,
models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of
widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average.
Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an
interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates
moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn
reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive
behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned
models.

*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and fine-tuned hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (91%) and AUC (97%) for early Alzheimer's Disease detection through language analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease is crucial for timely treatment and reducing healthcare burden. Language capability changes serve as early indicators of AD, making automated language analysis a promising diagnostic approach.

Method: Hybrid word embedding combining Doc2Vec and ELMo vectors to obtain sentence perplexity scores, enriched with linguistic features for syntax and semantics analysis. The embedded feature vector is input to logistic regression with fine-tuned hyperparameters including model regularization, learning rate, and vector sizes.

Result: Achieved 91% classification accuracy and 97% AUC in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects, outperforming existing NLP models (88% accuracy). Model shows high stability with standard deviation of accuracy = 0.0403 and AUC = 0.0174 across random data splits.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an accurate and stable model suitable for large-scale AD screening and as a complementary diagnostic tool for doctors in early Alzheimer's detection.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD
patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating
financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language
capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I
develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and
fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early
detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word
vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The
scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic
context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic
features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature
vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the
pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g.,
model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and
vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based
on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best
existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the
model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable
even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy
= 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method
is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening
method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A benchmark called Beyond One World is introduced to evaluate LLMs' ability to faithfully role-play different versions of characters across multiverses, focusing on canonical accuracy and reasoning alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored capacity of LLMs to consistently portray version-specific characters across different canons and universes, using superheroes as a testbed.

Method: Created a benchmark with 30 heroes and 90 canon-specific versions, featuring Canon Events (factual recall) and Moral Dilemmas tasks. Proposed Think-Act Matching metric to quantify alignment between reasoning and actions.

Result: Chain-of-thought improves coherence in weaker models but reduces accuracy in stronger ones; cross-version generalization is challenging; models rarely excel at both thinking and acting simultaneously.

Conclusion: Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, providing a challenging evaluation framework for role-playing LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents,
yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific
characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes --
remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich
testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same
character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this
problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded
roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The
benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of
pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with
ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and
reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation
("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act
Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and
serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and
non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought
prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce
canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a
character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either
thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in
multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging
evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-performing medical LLMs require extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions.

Method: Two-stage architecture: confidence detection module assesses primary model's certainty, and adaptive routing mechanism directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge for collaborative reasoning.

Result: Achieves competitive performance with strong results in PubMedQA (95.0%) and MedMCQA (78.0%). Ablation studies confirm confidence-aware routing with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms single-model approaches.

Conclusion: Strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require
extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting
accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study
introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model
diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our
framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module
assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism
directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge
for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using
Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical
benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework
achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA
(95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware
routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms
single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes
that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally
efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications
for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper investigates LLM resilience against character-level perturbations using invisible Unicode control characters to prevent misuse, finding surprising robustness despite significant tokenization fragmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine LLM resilience against structured character-level noise and develop methods to discourage LLM misuse in sensitive applications like online exams.

Method: Introduces a method that inserts invisible Unicode control characters after each input character, creating noisy text that fragments tokenization and reduces signal-to-noise ratio.

Result: Despite strong obfuscation, many LLMs maintain notable performance. The study explores robustness mechanisms through comprehensive evaluation across model, problem, and noise configurations.

Conclusion: Findings reveal surprising low-level robustness in LLMs, highlighting both risks of misuse and reliability concerns for deploying LLMs in diverse applications.

Abstract: This work investigates the resilience of contemporary LLMs against frequent
and structured character-level perturbations, specifically through the
insertion of noisy characters after each input character. We introduce
\nameshort{}, a practical method that inserts invisible Unicode control
characters into text to discourage LLM misuse in scenarios such as online exam
systems. Surprisingly, despite strong obfuscation that fragments tokenization
and reduces the signal-to-noise ratio significantly, many LLMs still maintain
notable performance. Through comprehensive evaluation across model-, problem-,
and noise-related configurations, we examine the extent and mechanisms of this
robustness, exploring both the handling of character-level tokenization and
\textit{implicit} versus \textit{explicit} denoising mechanism hypotheses of
character-level noises. We hope our findings on the low-level robustness of
LLMs will shed light on the risks of their misuse and on the reliability of
deploying LLMs across diverse applications.

Motivation: To serve the 68.8 million people in the U.S. who don't speak English at home and advance a Weather-Ready Nation by ensuring all Americans receive timely weather warnings.

Method: Partnership with LILT using patented LLM training to adapt NMT tools for weather terminology, GIS mapping to identify language needs, and integration of ethical AI practices with human oversight.

Result: Development of scalable translation system that significantly reduces manual translation time, creates culturally relevant translations, and produces experimental multilingual NWS products including warnings and forecasts.

Conclusion: This work brings the country closer to a national warning system that reaches all Americans through accurate, timely, and culturally relevant multilingual weather communication.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is
developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million
people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the
foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by
artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented
training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine
translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for
scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the
system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese,
and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for
multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and
culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation
time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution
of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across
different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that
need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the
program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight
guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the
public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental
multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and
educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national
warning system that reaches all Americans.

*Mykolas Sveistrys,Richard Kunert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces pluri-hop questions that require exhaustive retrieval across all documents and proposes PluriHopRAG, a novel RAG architecture that achieves 18-52% F1 score improvements by decomposing queries and using cross-encoder filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional QA systems struggle with questions requiring aggregation across all documents in repetitive, distractor-rich corpora like medical records or compliance filings, where missing even one passage significantly impacts accuracy.

Method: Proposed PluriHopRAG architecture that (i) decomposes queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses cross-encoder filtering to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning, following a 'check all documents individually, filter cheaply' approach.

Result: PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base LLM, outperforming traditional RAG pipelines and graph-based/multimodal variants that didn't exceed 40% F1 score.

Conclusion: PluriHopWIND dataset exposes limitations of current QA systems on repetitive corpora, and PluriHopRAG demonstrates the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful alternative to top-k methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) have enabled progress on question answering (QA) when relevant
evidence is in one (single-hop) or multiple (multi-hop) passages. Yet many
realistic questions about recurring report data - medical records, compliance
filings, maintenance logs - require aggregation across all documents, with no
clear stopping point for retrieval and high sensitivity to even one missed
passage. We term these pluri-hop questions and formalize them by three
criteria: recall sensitivity, exhaustiveness, and exactness. To study this
setting, we introduce PluriHopWIND, a diagnostic multilingual dataset of 48
pluri-hop questions built from 191 real-world wind industry reports in German
and English. We show that PluriHopWIND is 8-40% more repetitive than other
common datasets and thus has higher density of distractor documents, better
reflecting practical challenges of recurring report corpora. We test a
traditional RAG pipeline as well as graph-based and multimodal variants, and
find that none of the tested approaches exceed 40% in statement-wise F1 score.
Motivated by this, we propose PluriHopRAG, a RAG architecture that follows a
"check all documents individually, filter cheaply" approach: it (i) decomposes
queries into document-level subquestions and (ii) uses a cross-encoder filter
to discard irrelevant documents before costly LLM reasoning. We find that
PluriHopRAG achieves relative F1 score improvements of 18-52% depending on base
LLM. Despite its modest size, PluriHopWIND exposes the limitations of current
QA systems on repetitive, distractor-rich corpora. PluriHopRAG's performance
highlights the value of exhaustive retrieval and early filtering as a powerful
alternative to top-k methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This study shows that analyzing longitudinal comment trees from social media significantly improves prediction of users' evolving suicidal risk levels compared to analyzing individual posts alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Suicide is a critical global health issue, and while previous research focused on detecting suicidal expressions in single social media posts, there's limited attention on analyzing sequential comment trees over time to predict evolving suicidal risk.

Method: Constructed a high-quality annotated dataset from Reddit with users' posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Conducted statistical analysis and LLM experiments.

Result: Incorporating comment trees data significantly enhances both discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk levels compared to methods that only analyze individual posts.

Conclusion: This research provides novel insights for enhancing detection accuracy of at-risk individuals and offers a valuable foundation for early suicide intervention strategies through longitudinal social media analysis.

Abstract: Suicide remains a critical global public health issue. While previous studies
have provided valuable insights into detecting suicidal expressions in
individual social media posts, limited attention has been paid to the analysis
of longitudinal, sequential comment trees for predicting a user's evolving
suicidal risk. Users, however, often reveal their intentions through historical
posts and interactive comments over time. This study addresses this gap by
investigating how the information in comment trees affects both the
discrimination and prediction of users' suicidal risk levels. We constructed a
high-quality annotated dataset, sourced from Reddit, which incorporates users'
posting history and comments, using a refined four-label annotation framework
based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Statistical
analysis of the dataset, along with experimental results from Large Language
Models (LLMs) experiments, demonstrates that incorporating comment trees data
significantly enhances the discrimination and prediction of user suicidal risk
levels. This research offers a novel insight to enhancing the detection
accuracy of at-risk individuals, thereby providing a valuable foundation for
early suicide intervention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate, and real SNS/email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns.

Method: Built a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. Evaluated prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization methods.

Result: Established the first benchmark for YNTP, capturing natural daily-life communication patterns and enabling analysis of users' internal models.

Conclusion: Provides a foundation for user-aligned language modeling with publicly available dataset.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general next-token prediction but still
struggle to generate responses that reflect how individuals truly communicate,
such as replying to emails or social messages in their own style. However, real
SNS or email histories are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns. To
address this, we propose the task of "Your Next Token Prediction (YNTP)", which
models a user's precise word choices through controlled human-agent
conversations. We build a multilingual benchmark of 100 dialogue sessions
across English, Japanese, and Chinese, where users interact for five days with
psychologically grounded NPCs based on MBTI dimensions. This setup captures
natural, daily-life communication patterns and enables analysis of users'
internal models. We evaluate prompt-based and fine-tuning-based personalization
methods, establishing the first benchmark for YNTP and a foundation for

TL;DR: MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG framework improves biomedical QA by reducing hallucinations through citation-aware reasoning, iterative retrieval-verification, and preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG systems in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to post-retrieval noise and insufficient evidence verification, undermining response reliability.

Method: Three innovations: citation-aware reasoning with Negative Knowledge Assertions, iterative retrieval-verification with Medical Gap Analysis, and MedTrust-Align Module using Direct Preference Optimization.

Result: Outperforms baselines on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med with 2.7% gain for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances factual consistency and mitigates hallucinations in medical QA through structured evidence grounding and iterative verification.

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of
complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising
capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems
enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However,
RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to
post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence,
undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a
framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations
in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces
citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly
grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge
Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative
retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence
adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable
information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM)
that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative
samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce
citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response
patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model
architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing web agents focus on information retrieval but lack information aggregation capabilities needed for deep research, limiting their ability to synthesize knowledge from multiple sources.

Method: Explore to Evolve paradigm: agents proactively explore the web to collect evidence, then self-evolve aggregation programs using 12 high-level logical types to create verifiable QA pairs. Built on SmolAgents framework with supervised fine-tuning.

Result: WebAggregator-8B matches GPT-4.1 performance, while 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by >10% on GAIA-text and approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. On WebAggregatorQA benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet achieves 28% and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%, showing current models struggle with information aggregation.

Conclusion: Web agents need strengthened information aggregation capabilities beyond just retrieval. The proposed approach successfully addresses this gap and provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating aggregation abilities.

Abstract: Deep research web agents not only retrieve information from diverse sources
such as web environments, files, and multimodal inputs, but more importantly,
they need to rigorously analyze and aggregate knowledge for insightful
research. However, existing open-source deep research agents predominantly
focus on enhancing information-seeking capabilities of web agents to locate
specific information, while overlooking the essential need for information
aggregation, which would limit their ability to support in-depth research. We
propose an Explore to Evolve paradigm to scalably construct verifiable training
data for web agents. Begins with proactive online exploration, an agent sources
grounded information by exploring the real web. Using the collected evidence,
the agent then self-evolves an aggregation program by selecting, composing, and
refining operations from 12 high-level logical types to synthesize a verifiable
QA pair. This evolution from high-level guidance to concrete operations allowed
us to scalably produce WebAggregatorQA, a dataset of 10K samples across 50K
websites and 11 domains. Based on an open-source agent framework, SmolAgents,
we collect supervised fine-tuning trajectories to develop a series of
foundation models, WebAggregator. WebAggregator-8B matches the performance of
GPT-4.1, while the 32B variant surpasses GPT-4.1 by more than 10% on GAIA-text
and closely approaches Claude-3.7-sonnet. Moreover, given the limited
availability of benchmarks that evaluate web agents' information aggregation
abilities, we construct a human-annotated evaluation split of WebAggregatorQA
as a challenging test set. On this benchmark, Claude-3.7-sonnet only achieves
28%, and GPT-4.1 scores 25.8%. Even when agents manage to retrieve all
references, they still struggle on WebAggregatorQA, highlighting the need to
strengthen the information aggregation capabilities of web agent foundations.

*Reid T. Johnson,Michelle D. Pain,Jordan D. West*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NLT replaces programmatic JSON tool calling with natural language outputs, improving accuracy by 18.4 percentage points and reducing variance by 70% across 10 models and 6,400 trials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To eliminate task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call performance in LLMs by decoupling tool selection from response generation.

Method: A framework that replaces programmatic JSON tool calling with natural language outputs, evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials in customer service and mental health domains.

Result: Improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4 percentage points, reduces output variance by 70%, with open-weight models showing largest gains and surpassing closed-weight alternatives.

Conclusion: NLT enables persistent improvements under prompt perturbations and extends tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support, with implications for model training in both RL and supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: We present Natural Language Tools (NLT), a framework that replaces
programmatic JSON tool calling in large language models (LLMs) with natural
language outputs. By decoupling tool selection from response generation, NLT
eliminates task interference and format constraints that degrade tool call
performance. When evaluated across 10 models and 6,400 trials spanning customer
service and mental health domains, NLT improves tool calling accuracy by 18.4
percentage points while reducing output variance by 70%. Open-weight models see
the largest gains, surpassing flagship closed-weight alternatives, with
implications for model training in both reinforcement learning and supervised
fine-tuning stages. These improvements persist under prompt perturbations and
extend tool-calling capabilities to models lacking native support.

### [97] [LiRA: Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Cross-lingual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14466)
*Haolin Li,Haipeng Zhang,Mang Li,Yaohua Wang,Lijie Wen,Yu Zhang,Biqing Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LiRA is a training framework that improves cross-lingual representations for low-resource languages through anchor-based alignment and language-aware reasoning, showing consistent gains in retrieval and reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance on low-resource languages remains substantially lower than high-resource languages due to limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual alignment.

Method: LiRA comprises two modules: Arca (anchors low-resource languages to English via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent collaborative encoding) and LaSR (adds language-aware reasoning head with consistency regularization).

Result: Experiments across low-resource benchmarks show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and noise-amplified settings; ablations validate both Arca and LaSR contributions.

Conclusion: LiRA robustly improves cross-lingual representations for low-resource languages while strengthening retrieval and reasoning capabilities, with code and dataset released publicly.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource
languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains
substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to
limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual
alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language
Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual
representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening
retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored
Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages
to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent
collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding
space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a
language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on
top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to
enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We
further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering
five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across
low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and
reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and
noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and
LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

### [98] [Efficient Seq2seq Coreference Resolution Using Entity Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14504)
*Matt Grenander,Shay B. Cohen,Mark Steedman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a compressed representation method to improve efficiency of seq2seq coreference models in incremental settings like dialogue, achieving near state-of-the-art performance with significant token compression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seq2seq coreference models achieve state-of-the-art performance but lack flexibility and efficiency for incremental settings where text must be processed sequentially.

Method: Proposes a compressed representation by extracting and re-organizing entity-level tokens while discarding most other input tokens.

Result: On OntoNotes: achieves 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below full-prefix baseline with 1.8 compression ratio. On LitBank: surpasses state-of-the-art performance with singleton mentions.

Conclusion: Discarding a wide portion of tokens in seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference resolution.

Abstract: Seq2seq coreference models have introduced a new paradigm for coreference
resolution by learning to generate text corresponding to coreference labels,
without requiring task-specific parameters. While these models achieve new
state-of-the-art performance, they do so at the cost of flexibility and
efficiency. In particular, they do not efficiently handle incremental settings
such as dialogue, where text must processed sequentially. We propose a
compressed representation in order to improve the efficiency of these methods
in incremental settings. Our method works by extracting and re-organizing
entity-level tokens, and discarding the majority of other input tokens. On
OntoNotes, our best model achieves just 0.6 CoNLL F1 points below a
full-prefix, incremental baseline while achieving a compression ratio of 1.8.
On LitBank, where singleton mentions are annotated, it passes state-of-the-art
performance. Our results indicate that discarding a wide portion of tokens in
seq2seq resolvers is a feasible strategy for incremental coreference
resolution.

### [99] [Assessing Socio-Cultural Alignment and Technical Safety of Sovereign LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14565)
*Kyubyung Chae,Gihoon Kim,Gyuseong Lee,Taesup Kim,Jaejin Lee,Heejin Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper addresses the gap in evaluating sovereign LLMs by creating a new dataset and analytic framework to assess socio-cultural alignment and technical robustness, finding that current models don't fully serve target users and may compromise safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's growing interest in sovereign LLMs tailored to specific socio-cultural contexts, but a shortage of frameworks to verify their alignment with users' backgrounds and safety/technical robustness.

Method: Constructed a new dataset and introduced an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs alongside technical robustness assessments.

Result: Sovereign LLMs support low-resource languages but don't always serve target users well as claimed, and pursuing untested claims may lead to underestimating critical safety attributes.

Conclusion: Advancing sovereign LLMs requires more extensive evaluation incorporating broader, well-grounded practical criteria beyond current claims.

Abstract: Recent trends in LLMs development clearly show growing interest in the use
and application of sovereign LLMs. The global debate over sovereign LLMs
highlights the need for governments to develop their LLMs, tailored to their
unique socio-cultural and historical contexts. However, there remains a
shortage of frameworks and datasets to verify two critical questions: (1) how
well these models align with users' socio-cultural backgrounds, and (2) whether
they maintain safety and technical robustness without exposing users to
potential harms and risks. To address this gap, we construct a new dataset and
introduce an analytic framework for extracting and evaluating the
socio-cultural elements of sovereign LLMs, alongside assessments of their
technical robustness. Our experimental results demonstrate that while sovereign
LLMs play a meaningful role in supporting low-resource languages, they do not
always meet the popular claim that these models serve their target users well.
We also show that pursuing this untested claim may lead to underestimating
critical quality attributes such as safety. Our study suggests that advancing
sovereign LLMs requires a more extensive evaluation that incorporates a broader
range of well-grounded and practical criteria.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Current preference learning methods fail when objective quality signals are removed. WritingPreferenceBench dataset shows sequence-based reward models achieve only 52.7% accuracy, while generative reward models with reasoning chains reach 81.8%. High variance across writing genres suggests RLHF primarily learns objective error detection rather than subjective quality preferences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current preference learning methods show significant performance degradation when objective quality signals are removed, indicating they may not effectively capture subjective quality preferences like creativity and emotional resonance.

Method: Created WritingPreferenceBench dataset with 1,800 human-annotated preference pairs across 8 creative writing genres, with responses matched for objective correctness, factual accuracy, and length. Tested sequence-based reward models, zero-shot language model judges, and generative reward models with explicit reasoning chains.

Result: Sequence-based reward models achieved 52.7% mean accuracy, zero-shot language model judges 53.9%, while generative reward models with reasoning chains achieved 81.8% accuracy. High within-model variance across genres (18.2% to 81.8%) with standard deviations averaging 10.1%. No consistent improvement with model scale (27B vs 8B parameters).

Conclusion: Current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences. Successful preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather than direct classification.

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard
benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective
quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of
1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8
creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness,
factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward
models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy,
while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative
reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We
observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from
18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard
deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale,
with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants.
Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect
objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g.,
creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful
preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather
than direct classification.

*Kedi Chen,Zhikai Lei,Xu Guo,Xuecheng Wu,Siyuan Zeng,Jianghao Yin,Yinqi Zhang,Qin Chen,Jie Zhou,Liang He,Qipeng Guo,Kai Chen,Wei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeSeq is a synthetic dataset for training LLMs on inductive reasoning through general term generation tasks from number sequences, using reflection on failed cases and reinforcement learning with solvability-based rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing inductive reasoning research faces challenges: current datasets lack complex internal patterns, and methods don't provide precise thinking processes or difficulty control. LLMs show promise in reasoning but need better training approaches for inductive reasoning.

Method: Created CodeSeq dataset from number sequences packaged as algorithmic problems. Uses supervised finetuning with reflection on failed test cases and iterative corrections. Implements reinforcement learning with Case-Synergy Solvability Scaling Reward based on problem pass rate and self-directed case generation success.

Result: Models trained with CodeSeq show improved performance on various reasoning tasks while preserving out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.

Conclusion: CodeSeq effectively enhances LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities through structured training with reflection and reinforcement learning, addressing limitations of existing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks.
Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better
alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research
on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data
mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal
patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple
prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor
implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges
by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from
number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to
discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task
correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by
reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections,
thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking.
Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy
Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the
problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation,
enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures.
Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve
on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

*Qing Yang,Zhenghao Liu,Junxin Wang,Yangfan Du,Pengcheng Huang,Tong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLAIF-SPA framework uses reinforcement learning with AI feedback to improve emotional expressiveness in text-to-speech synthesis by optimizing semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTS systems achieve near-human quality in neutral speech but struggle with emotional expressiveness, often producing emotionally flat speech despite accurate content.

Method: Uses Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) with ASR for semantic accuracy and LLM for prosodic-emotional label alignment across four dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone.

Result: Outperforms Chat-TTS with 26.1% WER reduction, 9.1% SIM-O increase, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation on Libri Speech dataset.

Conclusion: RLAIF-SPA effectively enhances emotional expressiveness and intelligibility in TTS synthesis through direct optimization of semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment.

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech,
but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely
on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to
capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech,
leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address
these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a
Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to
respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as
a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization.
Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive
quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional
alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and
Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the
generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech
dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in
WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

### [103] [Intent Clustering with Shared Pseudo-Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14640)
*I-Fan Lin,Faegheh Hasibi,Suzan Verberne*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A training-free, label-free intent clustering method using lightweight open-source LLMs that generates pseudo-labels for texts and performs multi-label classification, achieving competitive results without knowing cluster numbers in advance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current approaches that rely on costly commercial LLMs with limited transparency and require knowing the number of clusters beforehand, which is often unrealistic in practical settings.

Method: Instead of direct similarity matching, the method first generates pseudo-labels for each text using LLMs, then performs multi-label classification in this pseudo-label space. The approach leverages the hypothesis that texts from the same cluster share more labels and thus have closer embeddings.

Result: Evaluation on four benchmark sets shows the method achieves comparable or better results than recent baselines while being simple and computationally efficient.

Conclusion: The method is applicable in low-resource scenarios and demonstrates stability across multiple models and datasets, offering a transparent and cost-effective alternative to commercial LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intuitive, training-free and label-free method
for intent clustering that makes minimal assumptions using lightweight and
open-source LLMs. Many current approaches rely on commercial LLMs, which are
costly, and offer limited transparency. Additionally, their methods often
explicitly depend on knowing the number of clusters in advance, which is often
not the case in realistic settings. To address these challenges, instead of
asking the LLM to match similar text directly, we first ask it to generate
pseudo-labels for each text, and then perform multi-label classification in
this pseudo-label set for each text. This approach is based on the hypothesis
that texts belonging to the same cluster will share more labels, and will
therefore be closer when encoded into embeddings. These pseudo-labels are more
human-readable than direct similarity matches. Our evaluation on four benchmark
sets shows that our approach achieves results comparable to and better than
recent baselines, while remaining simple and computationally efficient. Our
findings indicate that our method can be applied in low-resource scenarios and
is stable across multiple models and datasets.

*Linyue Ma,Yilong Xu,Xiang Long,Zhi Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes 'nugget-as-rubric' paradigm for verifiable reward modeling in search-augmented LLMs, introduces Search-Gen-V (4B parameter verifier), and shows strong verification accuracy across workloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs has limitations: rule-based rewards are fragile to expression variations, while generative rewards lack verifiability and are computationally expensive for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora.

Method: Proposes 'nugget-as-rubric' paradigm treating atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria. For long-form tasks, uses automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting to extract rubrics from static/dynamic corpora. Introduces Search-Gen-V, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier trained via distillation and two-stage strategy.

Result: Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed unified verifiable paradigm and Search-Gen-V verifier effectively address limitations of existing reward modeling approaches for search-augmented LLMs, providing scalable and robust verification capabilities.

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval
capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters.
Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable
technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing
reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based
rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in
expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast,
generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable
rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also
incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and
verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points
as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads.
Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand
to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support
long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based
on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each
question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from
dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a
4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable
paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage
strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong
verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust,
and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.

*Xinyue Ma,Pol Pastells,Mireia Farrús,Mariona Taulé*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to teach machine translation models about semantic prosody, specifically focusing on the negative semantic prosody of Chinese BEI passives, and demonstrates improved translation accuracy through fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine translation models cannot handle semantic prosody, which is crucial for accurate translations since literal translations of words may have different semantic prosody.

Method: Created a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs demonstrating negative semantic prosody of BEI passives, then fine-tuned OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with this dataset for English-Chinese translation.

Result: Fine-tuned MT models perform better at using BEI passives for translating unfavorable content and avoid using it for neutral/favorable content. In NLLB-600M, this knowledge transfers to other language pairs like Spanish-Chinese.

Conclusion: The approach successfully teaches machine translation models about semantic prosody, improving translation accuracy and demonstrating cross-lingual transferability of semantic prosody knowledge.

Abstract: Semantic prosody is a collocational meaning formed through the co-occurrence
of a linguistic unit and a consistent series of collocates, which should be
treated separately from semantic meaning. Since words that are literal
translations of each other may have different semantic prosody, more attention
should be paid to this linguistic property to generate accurate translations.
However, current machine translation models cannot handle this problem. To
bridge the gap, we propose an approach to teach machine translation models
about semantic prosody of a specific structure. We focus on Chinese BEI
passives and create a dataset of English-Chinese sentence pairs with the
purpose of demonstrating the negative semantic prosody of BEI passives. Then we
fine-tune OPUS-MT, NLLB-600M and mBART50 models with our dataset for the
English-Chinese translation task. Our results show that fine-tuned MT models
perform better on using BEI passives for translating unfavourable content and
avoid using it for neutral and favourable content. Also, in NLLB-600M, which is
a multilingual model, this knowledge of semantic prosody can be transferred
from English-Chinese translation to other language pairs, such as
Spanish-Chinese.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI healthcare tools are rapidly developed but often ignore real-world contexts and diverse user needs, leading to risks of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access. Automated risk detection methods reduce human engagement in understanding how harms arise.

Method: Human-centered framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before AI deployment.

Result: Participants who read stories recognized a broader range of harms across all 13 harm types, while those without stories focused primarily on privacy and well-being (58.3%). Storytelling enabled more creative speculation about AI's impact.

Conclusion: Storytelling helps identify a wider range of potential harms and benefits in AI healthcare systems, promoting more comprehensive risk assessment and creative thinking about AI's societal impact.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, enabling
fast development of tools like stress monitors, wellness trackers, and mental
health chatbots. However, rapid and low-barrier development can introduce risks
of bias, privacy violations, and unequal access, especially when systems ignore
real-world contexts and diverse user needs. Many recent methods use AI to
detect risks automatically, but this can reduce human engagement in
understanding how harms arise and who they affect. We present a human-centered
framework that generates user stories and supports multi-agent discussions to
help people think creatively about potential benefits and harms before
deployment. In a user study, participants who read stories recognized a broader
range of harms, distributing their responses more evenly across all 13 harm
types. In contrast, those who did not read stories focused primarily on privacy
and well-being (58.3%). Our findings show that storytelling helped participants
speculate about a broader range of harms and benefits and think more creatively
about AI's impact on users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs using RLVR often lead to spurious reasoning because only final-answer correctness is rewarded, lacking process-level supervision.

Method: Uses a scalable self-aggregation method to distill consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories for problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses spurious reasoning in MLLMs by integrating process-level supervision through automatic rubric-based rewards.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced from
perception tasks to complex multi-step reasoning, yet reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards (RLVR) often leads to spurious reasoning since only the
final-answer correctness is rewarded. To address this limitation, we propose
AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision
through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key
innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent
reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific
rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By
jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and
substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pluto is a benchmark and evaluation framework for assessing LLM-generated Verilog designs, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks by including synthesis efficiency metrics (area, delay, power) alongside functional correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for LLM-generated hardware designs focus primarily on functional correctness but lack comprehensive evaluation of synthesis efficiency metrics (area, delay, power) that are crucial for practical hardware design.

Method: Developed Pluto benchmark with 114 problems featuring self-checking testbenches and multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations to evaluate both functional correctness and synthesis efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog code.

Result: State-of-the-art LLMs achieve 78.3% functional correctness (pass@1) but lag in synthesis efficiency: 63.8% area efficiency, 65.9% delay efficiency, and 64.0% power efficiency (eff@1) compared to expert implementations.

Conclusion: Efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks like Pluto are essential for advancing hardware-focused LLM research, as current LLMs generate functionally correct but inefficient hardware designs compared to expert implementations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware
design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks
focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands
additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power.
Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively:
they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address
these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to
assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a
comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and
multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show
that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching
78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind
expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay
efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COIG-Writer is a Chinese creative writing dataset with 1,665 triplets across 51 genres, providing reverse-engineered prompts, creative reasoning, and final texts. It reveals creative writing requires narrative logic (from process supervision) and linguistic expression (from general data), with optimal performance at 1:12 creative-to-general data ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models have systematic deficiencies in creative writing, especially in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks process-level supervision.

Method: Created COIG-Writer dataset through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality Chinese texts, comprising triplets with prompts, creative reasoning, and final texts across 51 genres.

Result: Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general data (optimal 1:12 ratio), creative capabilities are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap), and lexical diversity inversely correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox).

Conclusion: Creative excellence emerges from interaction between logical scaffolding and linguistic grounding, similar to how mathematical reasoning enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

Abstract: Large language models exhibit systematic deficiencies in creative writing,
particularly in non-English contexts where training data is scarce and lacks
process-level supervision. We present COIG-Writer, a novel Chinese creative
writing dataset that captures both diverse outputs and their underlying thought
processes through systematic reverse-engineering of high-quality texts. Unlike
existing datasets that provide only input-output pairs, COIG-Writer comprises
1,665 meticulously curated triplets spanning 51 genres, each containing: (1) a
reverse-engineered prompt, (2) detailed creative reasoning documenting
decision-making processes, and (3) the final text. Through comprehensive
experiments, we identify a two-component model of creative writing: narrative
logic (provided by process supervision) and linguistic expression (maintained
by general-purpose data). Our findings reveal three critical insights: (1)
Process supervision is highly effective but requires stabilization with general
data. A ratio of at least one creative sample to twelve general samples is
needed to achieve optimal performance; below this threshold, the win rate
progressively degrades (from 62.75% down to 35.78%)., (2) creative capabilities
are culturally-bound with no cross-lingual transfer (89.26pp gap between
Chinese and English performance), and (3) lexical diversity inversely
correlates with creative quality (TTR paradox), suggesting high diversity
signals compensatory behavior for logical deficiencies. These findings
establish that creative excellence emerges from the interaction between logical
scaffolding and linguistic grounding, analogous to how mathematical reasoning
enhances but cannot replace linguistic competence in foundation models.

*Hwiyeol Jo,Joosung Lee,Jaehone Lee,Sang-Woo Lee,Joonsuk Park,Kang Min Yoo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes Answer Regeneration, a framework that uses additional model inference to extract answers from reasoning models, improving performance and robustness across math problems and open-ended QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current answer extraction methods for reasoning models are highly sensitive to the specific algorithm used, which affects model evaluation reliability and performance consistency.

Method: Answer Regeneration framework that performs additional model inference by providing prior input/output prefaced with "Answer:" prompt, then extracts final answer from regenerated output.

Result: The framework shows improved performance and enhanced robustness, being extraction-rule-agnostic and applicable to math problems and open-ended question answering.

Conclusion: Answer Regeneration provides more reliable model evaluation results by reducing sensitivity to answer extraction algorithms.

Abstract: Evaluating generative models, such as large language models (LLMs), commonly
involves question-answering tasks where the final answer is selected based on
probability of answer choices. On the other hand, for models requiring
reasoning, the method of answer extraction plays a critical role. Our research
reveals that the performance of reasoning models and their final answer
distributions are highly sensitive to the answer extraction algorithm employed.
In order to mitigate this, we propose a basic framework: Answer Regeneration.
The method uses an additional model inference, providing the prior input and
output prefaced by the prompt "Answer:". The final answer is then selected or
extracted from the regenerated output. We show that this
extraction-rule-agnostic approach exhibits improved performance and enhanced
robustness. Furthermore, we have applied this framework to general math
problems and open-ended question answering tasks. Our analysis and this
framework could offer a more reliable results for model evaluation.

### [111] [Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824)
*Ziqi Dai,Xin Zhang,Mingxin Li,Yanzhao Zhang,Dingkun Long,Pengjun Xie,Meishan Zhang,Wenjie Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares contrastive learning (CL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for LLM-based reranking, finding that SFT provides stronger weighting and overall better performance than CL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a divergence in training objectives for reranking models - contrastive learning works better for BERT-style encoders while SFT appears more promising for LLMs. The paper aims to determine which objective is intrinsically better suited for LLM-based reranking and understand the underlying mechanisms.

Method: The authors conduct comprehensive comparison between CL and SFT for reranking using universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as experimental platform. They decompose objectives into weight (magnitude of updates) and direction (guidance for updates) components, and present a unified framework for understanding their interactions.

Result: SFT provides substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, while preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. SFT consistently outperforms CL for LLM reranking. Large-scale training with SFT achieves new state-of-the-art performance on MRB benchmark.

Conclusion: SFT has consistent advantage over CL for LLM reranking due to its stronger weighting scheme. The findings provide insights for future research and applications in LLM-based reranking.

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two
types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the
predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary
label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders,
various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective
than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language
models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts
''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears
more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This
divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better
suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In
this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and
SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the
experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components:
weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which
guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding
their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a
substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring
direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a
consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our
findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new
state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on
SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and
applications in this area.

*Guinan Su,Yanwu Yang,Li Shen,Lu Yin,Shiwei Liu,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A data-free online test-time adaptation framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models that optimizes routing decisions during text generation without external data or supervision, achieving performance gains on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to distribution shifts in deployment, and existing test-time adaptation methods focus on dense models and require external data, limiting applicability to MoE architectures.

Method: Cycles between two phases: during prefill and regular intervals, optimizes routing decisions using self-supervision based on generated sequence; uses lightweight additive vectors to update router logits in selected layers while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Achieves consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks (e.g., 5.5% improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE) while maintaining robustness to context shifts; naturally complements existing techniques (6% average gains with self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite).

Conclusion: The proposed data-free online test-time framework effectively adapts MoE routing decisions during generation, improving performance on reasoning tasks while maintaining efficiency and complementing existing scaling techniques.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficient scaling through sparse
expert activation, but often suffer from suboptimal routing decisions due to
distribution shifts in deployment. While existing test-time adaptation methods
could potentially address these issues, they primarily focus on dense models
and require access to external data, limiting their practical applicability to
MoE architectures. However, we find that, instead of relying on reference data,
we can optimize MoE expert selection on-the-fly based only on input context. As
such, we propose \textit{a data-free, online test-time framework} that
continuously adapts MoE routing decisions during text generation without
external supervision or data. Our method cycles between two phases: During the
prefill stage, and later in regular intervals, we optimize the routing
decisions of the model using self-supervision based on the already generated
sequence. Then, we generate text as normal, maintaining the modified router
until the next adaption. We implement this through lightweight additive vectors
that only update router logits in selected layers, maintaining computational
efficiency while preventing over-adaptation. The experimental results show
consistent performance gains on challenging reasoning tasks while maintaining
robustness to context shifts. For example, our method achieves a 5.5\%
improvement on HumanEval with OLMoE. Furthermore, owing to its plug-and-play
property, our method naturally complements existing test-time scaling
techniques, e.g., achieving 6\% average gains when incorporated with
self-consistency on DeepSeek-V2-Lite.

### [113] [Midtraining Bridges Pretraining and Posttraining Distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14865)
*Emmy Liu,Graham Neubig,Chenyan Xiong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Midtraining - mixing high-quality instruction data at the end of pretraining - is most effective for math and code domains, reducing syntactic gaps and outperforming continued pretraining by reducing forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite widespread use of midtraining in language model development, there's little scientific understanding of why this phase is effective or how it works.

Method: Conducted controlled experiments with language models pretrained from scratch and fine-tuned on supervised datasets across different domains, with ablations on midtraining timing and data mixture weights.

Result: Midtraining shows highest effectiveness in math and code domains, consistently outperforming continued pretraining in both in-domain validation loss and reduced pretraining data forgetting after posttraining.

Conclusion: Midtraining functions as a domain adaptation technique that yields better performance than continued pretraining through reduced forgetting, with timing having greater impact than mixture weights.

Abstract: Recently, many language models have been pretrained with a "midtraining"
phase, in which higher quality, often instruction-formatted data, is mixed in
at the end of pretraining. Despite the popularity of this practice, there is
little scientific understanding of this phase of model training or why it is
effective. In this work, we conduct the first systematic investigation of
midtraining through controlled experiments with language models pretrained from
scratch and fine-tuned on supervised finetuning datasets in different domains.
We find that when compared after supervised fine-tuning, the effectiveness of
midtraining is highest in the math and code domains, where midtraining can best
reduce the syntactic gap between pretraining and posttraining data. In these
cases, midtraining consistently outperforms continued pretraining in both
in-domain validation loss as well as pretraining data forgetting after
posttraining. We conduct ablations on the starting time of the midtraining
phase and mixture weights of the midtraining data, using code midtraining as a
case study, and find that timing has a greater impact than mixture weights,
with earlier introduction of specialized data, yielding greater benefits
in-domain as well as preserving general language modeling better. These
findings establish midtraining as a domain adaptation technique that compared
to continued pretraining yields better performance through reduced forgetting.

*Yu Zhou,Sohyun An,Haikang Deng,Da Yin,Clark Peng,Cho-Jui Hsieh,Kai-Wei Chang,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multimodal generative models suffer significant performance degradation (32-48%) with dialect inputs. Current mitigation methods provide minimal improvement (<7%) while harming Standard American English performance. The authors propose an encoder-based method that improves dialect performance by +34.4% while preserving SAE performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Contact languages like English have rich regional dialects, but it's unclear if multimodal generative models can effectively handle dialectal textual inputs, which is important for dialect speakers interacting with these models.

Method: Constructed a large-scale benchmark with 4200+ verified prompts across 6 English dialects. Evaluated 17 image/video models. Proposed an encoder-based mitigation strategy that teaches models to recognize dialect features while preserving Standard American English performance.

Result: Current models show 32.26-48.17% performance degradation with dialect inputs. The proposed method raised performance on five dialects to be on par with Standard American English (+34.4%) with near zero cost to SAE performance.

Conclusion: Multimodal generative models struggle significantly with dialect inputs, but the proposed encoder-based method effectively addresses this issue by improving dialect performance while maintaining SAE capabilities.

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form
of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with
generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively
produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this
question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common
English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200
unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our
automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art
multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation
when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods
such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance
by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance
degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a
general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our
method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE
performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our
method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on
par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures that require fine-grained control over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance.

Method: Built on MLIR, MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect with structured representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and memory resources, allowing orchestration of spatial scheduling, computation distribution, and communication-computation overlap without manual scheduling.

Result: For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute efficiency and performance almost identical to hand-optimized implementations. For multi-head attention, it enables fused implementations with ~150 lines of code, efficiently mapping complex workloads to spatial hardware.

Conclusion: MLIR-AIR transforms high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently utilize NPU compute fabric and memory hierarchy through compiler-managed scheduling, asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap.

Abstract: General-purpose compilers abstract away parallelism, locality, and
synchronization, limiting their effectiveness on modern spatial architectures.
As modern computing architectures increasingly rely on fine-grained control
over data movement, execution order, and compute placement for performance,
compiler infrastructure must provide explicit mechanisms for orchestrating
compute and data to fully exploit such architectures. We introduce MLIR-AIR, a
novel, open-source compiler stack built on MLIR that bridges the semantic gap
between high-level workloads and fine-grained spatial architectures such as
AMD's NPUs. MLIR-AIR defines the AIR dialect, which provides structured
representations for asynchronous and hierarchical operations across compute and
memory resources. AIR primitives allow the compiler to orchestrate spatial
scheduling, distribute computation across hardware regions, and overlap
communication with computation without relying on ad hoc runtime coordination
or manual scheduling. We demonstrate MLIR-AIR's capabilities through two case
studies: matrix multiplication and the multi-head attention block from the
LLaMA 2 model. For matrix multiplication, MLIR-AIR achieves up to 78.7% compute
efficiency and generates implementations with performance almost identical to
state-of-the-art, hand-optimized matrix multiplication written using the
lower-level, close-to-metal MLIR-AIE framework. For multi-head attention, we
demonstrate that the AIR interface supports fused implementations using
approximately 150 lines of code, enabling tractable expression of complex
workloads with efficient mapping to spatial hardware. MLIR-AIR transforms
high-level structured control flow into spatial programs that efficiently
utilize the compute fabric and memory hierarchy of an NPU, leveraging
asynchronous execution, tiling, and communication overlap through
compiler-managed scheduling.

TL;DR: A new approach combining synthetic data generation, triplet loss, and layer-wise model merging significantly improves output consistency in RAG systems by 47.5% over baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs in RAG systems generate inconsistent outputs for semantically equivalent inputs due to lack of consistency-focused training data and limitations of current fine-tuning techniques.

Method: Combines systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and novel layer-wise model merging using consistency-aware weights derived from intermediate layer activations.

Result: Merged model achieves ~47.5% improvement in response similarity over baseline, significantly enhancing output consistency.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical solution for increasing reliability of industrial RAG systems by effectively integrating knowledge from specialized models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems leverage Large Language Models
(LLMs) to generate accurate and reliable responses that are grounded in
retrieved context. However, LLMs often generate inconsistent outputs for
semantically equivalent inputs, a problem compounded by the scarcity of
consistency-focused training data and the limitations of current fine-tuning
techniques in enhancing output consistency. We propose a new approach combining
systematic synthetic data generation, triplet loss for better embeddings, and a
novel layer-wise model merging approach. Using consistency-aware weights
derived from intermediate layer activations, our method effectively integrates
knowledge from specialized models. Experimental results how that our merged
model significantly enhances output consistency, achieving a ~47.5\%
improvement in response similarity over the baseline, thus offering a practical
solution for increasing the reliability of an industrial RAG system.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework that models downstream task performance as a function of training compute and context, addressing limitations of conventional scaling laws that don't capture context-dependent performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional scaling laws fail to capture downstream task performance where context plays a critical role, creating a gap in understanding how training compute and context interact for real-world applications.

Method: Proposed an interpretable framework that jointly models downstream performance using training compute and provided context, validated on extended-context Llama-2 variants across 65,500 instances spanning arithmetic reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation tasks.

Result: The framework accurately models in-distribution downstream performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute, and reliably extrapolates performance as context increases.

Conclusion: The findings provide insights into the interplay between training compute and context utilization, offering guidance for designing more efficient long-context LLMs for diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: Scaling laws have transformed our understanding of large language models by
linking upstream metrics like cross-entropy loss to design factors such as
model size, training data, and compute. However, these conventional laws fail
to capture downstream task performance, where context plays a critical role. In
this work, we propose a straightforward, interpretable framework that jointly
models downstream performance as a function of the training compute and the
provided context. We empirically validate our framework by fitting it on the
observed downstream performance of extended-context variants of Llama-2-7B and
Llama-2-13B across 65,500 unique instances spanning three tasks: arithmetic
reasoning, common sense reasoning, and machine translation. Our results
demonstrate that our framework accurately models in-distribution downstream
performance, generalizes across three orders of magnitude in training compute,
and reliably extrapolates performance as the amount of context increases. These
findings offer valuable insights into the interplay between training compute
and context utilization, providing guidance for designing more efficient

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mental health disorders are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma. In primary care, providers misidentify depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the need for scalable, accessible diagnostic tools.

Method: Benchmarked multiple model classes including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1 Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank Adaptation (LoRA) on a dataset of 553 semistructured interviews paired with ground-truth diagnoses.

Result: Models achieved over 80% accuracy across diagnostic categories, with especially strong performance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and 98% recall). Shorter, focused context segments improved recall, and LoRA fine-tuning proved efficient with lower-rank configurations maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: LLM-based models offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report screening tools and provide a path toward low-barrier, AI-powered early diagnosis, laying groundwork for integration into clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma environments.

Abstract: Mental health disorders remain among the leading cause of disability
worldwide, yet conditions such as depression, anxiety, and Post-Traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed due to
subjective assessments, limited clinical resources, and stigma and low
awareness. In primary care settings, studies show that providers misidentify
depression or anxiety in over 60% of cases, highlighting the urgent need for
scalable, accessible, and context-aware diagnostic tools that can support early
detection and intervention. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of
machine learning models for mental health screening using a unique dataset of
553 real-world, semistructured interviews, each paried with ground-truth
diagnoses for major depressive episodes (MDE), anxiety disorders, and PTSD. We
benchmark multiple model classes, including zero-shot prompting with GPT-4.1
Mini and MetaLLaMA, as well as fine-tuned RoBERTa models using LowRank
Adaptation (LoRA). Our models achieve over 80% accuracy across diagnostic
categories, with especially strongperformance on PTSD (up to 89% accuracy and
98% recall). We also find that using shorter context, focused context segments
improves recall, suggesting that focused narrative cues enhance detection
sensitivity. LoRA fine-tuning proves both efficient and effective, with
lower-rank configurations (e.g., rank 8 and 16) maintaining competitive
performance across evaluation metrics. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based
models can offer substantial improvements over traditional self-report
screening tools, providing a path toward low-barrier, AI-powerd early
diagnosis. This work lays the groundwork for integrating machine learning into
real-world clinical workflows, particularly in low-resource or high-stigma
environments where access to timely mental health care is most limited.

*Wenkai Yang,Weijie Liu,Ruobing Xie,Yiju Guo,Lulu Wu,Saiyong Yang,Yankai Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RLVR with self-verification is inefficient due to separate solution and verification generation. The paper reveals that true reasoning reward equals last-token self-rewarding score, leading to LaSeR algorithm that adds MSE loss to align self-rewarding scores with verifier rewards, optimizing both reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities with minimal extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the efficiency problem in RLVR with self-verification, where previous methods require sequential generation using two separate prompt templates, significantly reducing efficiency.

Method: Propose LaSeR algorithm that augments RLVR loss with MSE loss to align last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards. The self-rewarding scores are derived from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token after generation, requiring only one additional token inference.

Result: Experiments show the method improves reasoning performance and equips the model with remarkable self-rewarding capability, boosting inference-time scaling performance.

Conclusion: LaSeR provides an efficient approach to unify reasoning and verification capabilities in LLMs by leveraging the theoretical insight that true reasoning reward equals last-token self-rewarding score, achieving performance improvements with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior
studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into
the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification
capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM
to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate
prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we
theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of
self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true
reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score,
which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token
log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last
token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on
this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token
Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with
a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based
reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding
capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in
both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm
derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of
the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra
cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not
only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with
remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time
scaling performance.

TL;DR: IGPO is a reinforcement learning framework that provides dense, intrinsic turn-level rewards for training LLM agents in multi-turn interactions by modeling information gain from each turn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL approaches for LLM agents rely on sparse outcome-based rewards at the final answer, which causes advantage collapse and poor credit assignment in multi-turn settings with long trajectories.

Method: IGPO defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer, modeling each interaction as an incremental information acquisition process. These intrinsic rewards are combined with outcome supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments show IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Conclusion: IGPO provides an effective solution to reward sparsity in multi-turn agent training through intrinsic turn-level rewards based on the model's own belief updates, without requiring external reward models or costly estimation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with
reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external
environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that
require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing
approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at
the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in
multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues:
(i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and
provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit
assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in
long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy
Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense
and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each
interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the
ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the
policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior
process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly
Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the
model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined
with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive
experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that
IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios,
achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.

TL;DR: UI-Simulator is a scalable paradigm for generating synthetic UI training trajectories to overcome expensive real-world data collection, with UI-Simulator-Grow enabling targeted scaling for efficient agent enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collecting diverse, large-scale UI trajectories for digital agents is prohibitively expensive in terms of human annotation, infrastructure, and engineering costs.

Method: Integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states, guided rollout for coherent exploration, and trajectory wrapper for high-quality trajectory synthesis. UI-Simulator-Grow adds targeted scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks and synthesizing informative variants.

Result: UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents trained on real UIs with better robustness using weaker teacher models. UI-Simulator-Grow matches Llama-3-70B-Instruct performance using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as base model.

Conclusion: Targeted synthesis scaling paradigm enables continuous and efficient enhancement of digital agents without expensive real-world data collection.

Abstract: Digital agents require diverse, large-scale UI trajectories to generalize
across real-world tasks, yet collecting such data is prohibitively expensive in
both human annotation, infra and engineering perspectives. To this end, we
introduce $\textbf{UI-Simulator}$, a scalable paradigm that generates
structured UI states and transitions to synthesize training trajectories at
scale. Our paradigm integrates a digital world simulator for diverse UI states,
a guided rollout process for coherent exploration, and a trajectory wrapper
that produces high-quality and diverse trajectories for agent training. We
further propose $\textbf{UI-Simulator-Grow}$, a targeted scaling strategy that
enables more rapid and data-efficient scaling by prioritizing high-impact tasks
and synthesizes informative trajectory variants. Experiments on WebArena and
AndroidWorld show that UI-Simulator rivals or surpasses open-source agents
trained on real UIs with significantly better robustness, despite using weaker
teacher models. Moreover, UI-Simulator-Grow matches the performance of
Llama-3-70B-Instruct using only Llama-3-8B-Instruct as the base model,
highlighting the potential of targeted synthesis scaling paradigm to
continuously and efficiently enhance the digital agents.

*Yinxi Li,Yuntian Deng,Pengyu Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces TokDrift, a framework showing that subword tokenizers in code LLMs cause semantically identical code to be tokenized differently based on superficial formatting, leading to substantial behavioral shifts in models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs for code use statistical subword tokenizers that don't align with programming language grammar, causing semantically identical code to be tokenized differently based on formatting variations.

Method: Developed TokDrift framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization, then analyzed nine code LLMs including large models with over 30B parameters.

Result: Even minor formatting changes cause substantial shifts in model behavior across all tested models. Layer-wise analysis shows the issue originates in early embeddings where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries.

Conclusion: Misaligned tokenization is a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as
byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and
programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a
result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently
depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To
measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework
that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants
differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones
with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial
shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates
in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token
boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle
to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for
grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.

### [124] [Attention Is All You Need for KV Cache in Diffusion LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14973)
*Quan Nguyen-Tri,Mukul Ranjan,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Elastic-Cache adaptively recomputes KV caches for diffusion LLMs to reduce redundant computation while maintaining accuracy, achieving up to 45.1x speedup on long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, leading to substantial computational redundancy.

Method: Proposes Elastic-Cache that jointly decides when to refresh (via attention-aware drift test on most-attended token) and where to refresh (via depth-aware schedule that recomputes from chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and off-window MASK caches).

Result: Achieves 8.7x speedup on GSM8K (256 tokens), 45.1x on longer sequences, and 4.8x on HumanEval while maintaining higher accuracy than baseline. Throughput increases 6.8x on GSM8K compared to existing confidence-based approaches.

Conclusion: Elastic-Cache enables practical deployment of diffusion LLMs by significantly reducing decoding latency with negligible quality loss, outperforming fixed-period schemes through adaptive, layer-aware cache updates.

Abstract: This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for
diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while
minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all
tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little
across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial
redundancy. We make three observations: (1) distant ${\bf MASK}$ tokens
primarily act as a length-bias and can be cached block-wise beyond the active
prediction window; (2) KV dynamics increase with depth, suggesting that
selective refresh starting from deeper layers is sufficient; and (3) the
most-attended token exhibits the smallest KV drift, providing a conservative
lower bound on cache change for other tokens. Building on these, we propose
${\bf Elastic-Cache}$, a training-free, architecture-agnostic strategy that
jointly decides ${when}$ to refresh (via an attention-aware drift test on the
most-attended token) and ${where}$ to refresh (via a depth-aware schedule that
recomputes from a chosen layer onward while reusing shallow-layer caches and
off-window MASK caches). Unlike fixed-period schemes, Elastic-Cache performs
adaptive, layer-aware cache updates for diffusion LLMs, reducing redundant
computation and accelerating decoding with negligible loss in generation
quality. Experiments on LLaDA-Instruct, LLaDA-1.5, and LLaDA-V across
mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate consistent
speedups: $8.7\times$ on GSM8K (256 tokens), $45.1\times$ on longer sequences,
and $4.8\times$ on HumanEval, while consistently maintaining higher accuracy
than the baseline. Our method achieves significantly higher throughput
($6.8\times$ on GSM8K) than existing confidence-based approaches while
preserving generation quality, enabling practical deployment of diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: MultiFoodChat demonstrates potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and analysis, enabling flexible, human-like understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual annotations.

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Combining YOLO with Vision Language Models (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini) improves aircraft detection and scene understanding in remote sensing, achieving 48.46% MAE improvement in detection accuracy and 6.17% CLIPScore improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional vision models require extensive labeled data and lack contextual understanding in complex remote sensing environments. VLMs offer complementary capabilities but remain underexplored for remote sensing applications.

Method: Integration of YOLO vision models with VLMs (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini) for enhanced image analysis, evaluated on both labeled/unlabeled remote sensing data and degraded image scenarios.

Result: 48.46% average MAE improvement in aircraft detection accuracy across models, particularly in challenging conditions. 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive scene understanding.

Conclusion: The combination of traditional vision models and VLMs enables more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially beneficial for few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

TL;DR: AI-based system using deep learning to detect cribriform morphology in prostate cancer biopsies, achieving pathologist-level performance and outperforming experts in inter-rater agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cribriform morphology indicates poor prognosis but is underreported with high interobserver variability among pathologists, necessitating improved detection methods.

Method: Deep learning model with EfficientNetV2-S encoder and multiple instance learning trained on 640 biopsies from 430 patients, validated internally and externally across multiple cohorts.

Result: Strong internal validation (AUC: 0.97, kappa: 0.81) and robust external validation (AUC: 0.90, kappa: 0.55). Model achieved highest inter-rater agreement (kappa: 0.66) outperforming all nine pathologists (kappa range: 0.35-0.62).

Conclusion: AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection, potentially enhancing diagnostic reliability, standardizing reporting, and improving treatment decisions.

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAPPure is an adversarial purification framework that handles non-additive perturbations like blur and occlusion, unlike existing methods designed only for additive perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial purification methods are ineffective against non-additive perturbations (blur, occlusion, distortion) since they're designed for additive perturbations, but real-world attacks often involve non-additive types.

Method: Establishes adversarial image generation process and disentangles clean image from perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization.

Result: Experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 show NAPPure significantly boosts model robustness against non-additive perturbations.

Conclusion: NAPPure extends adversarial purification to effectively handle non-additive perturbations, filling a gap in current defense methods.

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent is a graph-based retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework that enhances large video language models for long video understanding by preserving semantic relationships through structured graphs and introducing intermediate reasoning to reduce retrieval noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large video language models struggle with processing long videos due to context window limitations and difficulty retaining long-term sequential information. Existing RAG methods for videos face challenges with disrupted temporal dependencies and irrelevant information that hinder accurate reasoning.

Method: Proposes Vgent framework with two key innovations: (1) represents videos as structured graphs preserving semantic relationships across video clips, (2) introduces intermediate reasoning step with structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and facilitate explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips.

Result: Achieved 3.0%~5.4% overall performance improvement over base models on MLVU benchmark, and outperformed state-of-the-art video RAG methods by 8.6% across three long-video understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Vgent effectively addresses limitations of current LVLMs for long video understanding through graph-based representation and structured reasoning, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronizing videos from different scenes or generative AI videos is challenging due to diverse subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment, requiring more sophisticated approaches than simple time shifts.

Method: Temporal Prototype Learning (TPL) constructs a compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings using pretrained models, learning a unified prototype sequence that anchors key action phases to avoid exhaustive pairwise matching.

Result: TPL improves synchronization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks, and is the first approach to address synchronization in multiple generative AI videos.

Conclusion: TPL provides an effective framework for complex video synchronization tasks, particularly for videos from different scenes and generative AI content, with demonstrated improvements in performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

Motivation: Existing bioimage analysis tools lack scalability, GPU acceleration, comprehensive 3D support, and integration with modern scientific computing workflows, limiting their utility for large-scale microscopy datasets.

Method: cubic augments SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM, using device-agnostic dispatching that automatically uses GPU when data is on device and CPU otherwise.

Result: Benchmarking shows substantial speedups for individual operations and reproduction of deconvolution/segmentation pipelines while maintaining algorithmic fidelity.

Conclusion: cubic establishes a foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with Python's scientific computing ecosystem, enabling both interactive exploration and high-throughput automated workflows.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader

Motivation: To advance video generation integration into virtual production by providing strong multi-view identity preservation, precise camera control, and lighting adaptability.

Method: Train character consistency using volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories via 4DGS, lighting variability from video relighting model, and fine-tune state-of-the-art video diffusion models on this data.

*Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Mana Ihori,Tomohiro Tanaka,Naoki Makishima,Taiga Yamane,Naotaka Kawata,Satoshi Suzuki,Taichi Katayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes joint modeling of Big Five and HEXACO personality traits from multimodal human behavior, improving recognition by optimizing both trait models simultaneously.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies focused only on Big Five traits, missing HEXACO's Honesty-Humility dimension and unclear relationships between the two models when using machine learning.

Method: Joint optimization method for recognizing both Big Five and HEXACO personality traits from multimodal human behavior data.

Result: Experiments on self-introduction video dataset show effective recognition of both Big Five and HEXACO traits.

Conclusion: Joint modeling of Big Five and HEXACO improves multimodal personality trait recognition by leveraging relationships between the two models.

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

*Hongsong Wang,Renxi Cheng,Yang Zhang,Chaolei Han,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel method for detecting AI-generated images using bit-plane-based noise analysis and maximum gradient patch selection, achieving 98.9% accuracy with significantly faster processing than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI-generated image detection methods have high computational costs and fail to capture intrinsic noisy features in raw images, making it difficult to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones.

Method: Uses bit-plane-based image processing to extract noise patterns, applies image normalization strategies, implements maximum gradient patch selection to amplify noise signals, and proposes lightweight classification heads with noise-based and noise-guided structures.

Result: Achieves 98.9% average accuracy on GenImage benchmark (11.9% improvement), with excellent cross-generator generalization: 98.2% from GAN to Diffusion and 99.2% from Diffusion to GAN. Processing is nearly 100x faster than existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively detects AI-generated images by leveraging noise patterns through bit-plane analysis and gradient-based patch selection, offering high accuracy, strong generalization, and significantly improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

*Soumyya Kanti Datta,Tanvi Ranga,Chengzhe Sun,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PIA is a multimodal audio-visual framework that detects deepfakes by analyzing phoneme-temporal and identity-dynamic inconsistencies across language, face motion, and facial identification cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detection methods fail against advanced generative models that create nearly perfect individual frames but have subtle temporal discrepancies that traditional detectors miss.

Method: Uses phoneme sequences, lip geometry data, and facial identity embeddings in a multimodal framework to identify inconsistencies across language, dynamic face motion, and facial identification.

Result: Significantly improves detection of subtle deepfake alterations by capturing temporal inconsistencies that traditional methods overlook.

Conclusion: The integrated multimodal approach effectively addresses limitations of conventional deepfake detection methods against advanced generative models.

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

*Miu Sumino,Mayu Ishii,Shun Kaizu,Daisuke Hisano,Yu Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Event Interval Modulation (EIM) for event-based optical camera communication, achieving 28 kbps over 10m and 8.4 kbps over 50m.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing event-based OCC systems use conventional modulation schemes that don't fully exploit the unique characteristics of event-based vision sensors (EVS), limiting performance.

Method: Developed EIM scheme that modulates information using intervals between events, tuned EVS parameters for optimal frequency response, and experimentally determined maximum modulation order.

Result: Successfully demonstrated transmission at 28 kbps over 10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in indoor environment, setting new benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Conclusion: EIM enables significant improvement in transmission speed by leveraging the unique characteristics of EVS, making it a promising modulation scheme for high-speed event-based optical camera communication.

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

TL;DR: MACE enables efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes using mixed expert networks and auxiliary-loss-free load balancing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene Coordinate Regression methods struggle with large-scale scenes due to single network limitations and high computational costs.

Method: Uses gating network to select sub-networks, ensuring only one is active per inference, and implements auxiliary-loss-free load balancing strategy.

Result: Achieves significant cost reduction while maintaining higher precision, with high-quality rendering results after only 10 minutes of training.

Conclusion: Provides an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications with improved localization accuracy and rendering quality.

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

*Liao Shen,Wentao Jiang,Yiran Zhu,Tiezheng Ge,Zhiguo Cao,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPRO is a reinforcement learning-based video diffusion framework that enhances identity preservation in image-to-video generation by optimizing models using face identity scoring and KL-divergence regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing I2V models struggle with maintaining identity consistency between input human images and generated videos, especially when faces are small or undergo significant expression/movement changes, which is critical for human-centric applications.

Method: Proposes Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO) - a tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using face identity scorer, backpropagates reward through last sampling steps, uses ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, and incorporates KL-divergence regularization.

Result: Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and in-house I2V model demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing identity preservation.

Conclusion: IPRO provides a direct and effective solution for identity preservation in human-centric I2V generation without requiring auxiliary modules or architectural changes.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Result: Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods and successfully enhances both VACE and Phantom video generation systems.

Conclusion: The method offers actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation and demonstrates the importance of annotation quality and design choices in policy optimization for multi-human identity preservation.

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

*Tingman Yan,Tao Liu,Xilian Yang,Qunfei Zhao,Zeyang Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MatchAttention for efficient cross-view matching with dynamic relative position matching and hierarchical decoding, achieving SOTA performance with low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution image matching is challenging due to quadratic complexity in cross-attention and lack of explicit matching constraints in existing methods.

Method: Uses MatchAttention with BilinearSoftmax for continuous sliding-window attention, hierarchical MatchDecoder, and gated cross-MatchAttention with consistency loss to handle occlusions.

Result: MatchStereo-B ranked 1st on Middlebury benchmark, processes KITTI in 29ms, MatchStereo-T handles 4K UHD in 0.1s with 3GB GPU memory, achieves SOTA on multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Enables real-time, high-resolution, high-accuracy cross-view matching with efficient computational complexity.

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Conclusion: Hybrid 2D-3D approaches show significant potential by thoughtfully combining 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction pipelines to overcome limitations of either approach alone.

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details

inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.

Result: Validated on CAMELYON17 and private histopathology datasets, achieving up to 7% improvement in performance across unseen domains, outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: Causal inference shows strong potential as a powerful tool for addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition

Motivation: LVLMs are prone to hallucinations, often relying too heavily on a single modality or memorizing training data without proper grounding, which affects their reliability and performance.

Method: Three-step approach: (1) select mature and amateur layers among decoding layers, (2) identify pivot layer using watermark-related questions to assess visual grounding, (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding to generate final output.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks like POPE, MME and AMBER, significantly reducing hallucinations and generating more visually grounded responses.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking effectively mitigates hallucinations in LVLMs while maintaining strong performance across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris presentation attack detection (PAD) methods due to difficulties in constructing and imaging presentation attacks (PAs) like artificial eyes, printed images, and cosmetic contact lenses.

Method: MID-StyleGAN combines diffusion models and GANs with a multi-domain architecture that enables translation between bonafide ocular images and different PA domains, using an adaptive loss function tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency.

Result: The method outperforms existing approaches in generating high-quality synthetic ocular images. On the LivDet2020 dataset, it improved true detect rate at 1% false detect rate from 93.41% to 98.72%, significantly enhancing PAD system performance.

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN provides a scalable solution to data scarcity in iris and ocular biometrics by generating realistic synthetic data that substantially improves presentation attack detection capabilities.

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are supervised only by next-token prediction of text, neglecting critical vision-centric information needed for analytical abilities, which limits their visual comprehension capabilities.

Method: Introduces VaCo with Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) to activate specific visual signals supervised by diverse VFMs, and Token Gateway Mask (TGM) to coordinate representation conflicts across multiple VFMs.

Result: Extensive experiments show VaCo significantly improves performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior visual comprehension capabilities.

Conclusion: VaCo successfully addresses the vision-centric information gap in MLLMs by coordinating multiple vision foundation models, leading to enhanced multimodal understanding and analytical abilities.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Method: Uses cycle-consistent keypoints for spatial coherence constraints and introduces a pose block combining GRU recurrent units with transformation synchronization to blend historical and multi-view data.

Result: Outperforms previous self-supervised registration methods on ScanNet and 3DMatch datasets, even surpassing some older supervised methods. Integration into existing methods demonstrates component effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully utilizes unlabeled RGB-D data for geometric reasoning through cycle-consistent keypoints and novel pose architecture, achieving superior registration performance in self-supervised settings.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on
geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use
cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet
and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also
integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.

### [150] [Spatial Preference Rewarding for MLLMs Spatial Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14374)
*Han Qiu,Peng Gao,Lewei Lu,Xiaoqin Zhang,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPR (Spatial Preference Rewarding) enhances MLLMs' spatial understanding by rewarding detailed responses with precise object localization over vague ones, using semantic and localization scores for evaluation and direct preference optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack fine-grained spatial perception abilities like detailed region descriptions and accurate object localization, and often fail to meet user requirements for spatial understanding due to focusing on pre-annotated data without direct supervision of actual responses.

Method: SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to evaluate MLLM-generated descriptions, refines descriptions for better localization accuracy, and pairs best-scored refinements with lowest-scored initial descriptions for direct preference optimization.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard referring and grounding benchmarks show SPR effectively improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities with minimal training overhead.

Conclusion: SPR successfully enhances MLLMs' fine-grained spatial perception by directly supervising and rewarding precise localization in responses, addressing limitations in existing approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

*Dongnam Byun,Jungwon Park,Jumgmin Ko,Changin Choi,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS improves multi-object image generation by modifying CLIP text embeddings to address object neglect and mixing issues in text-to-image models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image models struggle with prompts containing multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing across four problematic scenarios.

Method: Proposes DOS (Directional Object Separation), which modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before feeding them into text-to-image models to better separate object representations.

Result: DOS consistently improves multi-object generation success rates, reduces object mixing, and significantly outperforms four competing methods in human evaluations (26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks).

Conclusion: DOS is a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation in text-to-image models.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

*Danish Ali,Ajmal Mian,Naveed Akhtar,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposed DRBD-Mamba, an efficient 3D brain tumor segmentation model using dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba with space-filling curves and gated fusion, achieving improved accuracy and 15x efficiency gain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational overhead of Mamba-based models and lack of robustness evaluation across diverse BraTS data partitions for reliable brain tumor segmentation.

Method: Dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba with space-filling curve for 3D-to-1D mapping, gated fusion module for context integration, and quantization block for feature discretization.

Result: Achieved Dice improvements: 0.10% whole tumor, 1.75% tumor core, 0.93% enhancing tumor on test set; 0.86% tumor core and 1.45% enhancing tumor gains on systematic folds with 15x efficiency improvement.

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba provides robust and computationally efficient brain tumor segmentation while maintaining competitive accuracy across diverse data conditions.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

TL;DR: BoardVision is a framework for detecting assembly-level motherboard defects using ensemble methods to balance precision and recall, with evaluation under realistic perturbations and a deployable GUI tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assembly-level inspection of full motherboards is underexplored compared to bare-board or trace-level PCB inspection, despite being critical for reliability in high-volume electronics manufacturing.

Method: Benchmarks YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN on motherboard dataset, then proposes Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter) ensemble to balance their strengths (YOLO's precision vs Faster R-CNN's recall). Evaluates robustness under perturbations like sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes.

Result: Systematic comparison shows YOLOv7 excels in precision but underperforms in recall, while Faster R-CNN shows the reverse pattern. CTV Voter ensemble effectively balances precision and recall through interpretable rules. Identifies stability challenges under realistic perturbations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates how computer vision techniques can transition from benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard manufacturing, with released deployable GUI-driven inspection tool.

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

TL;DR: DCMIL is a dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning model that efficiently processes whole slide images for cancer prognosis without dense annotations, outperforming standard methods across 12 cancer types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computational pathology faces challenges with gigapixel-size inputs and scarce dense annotations, while current methods overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and tumor microenvironment variations.

Method: Proposed DCMIL model uses easy-to-hard progressive representation learning with dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning to directly transform gigapixel WSIs into outcome predictions without dense annotations.

Result: Extensive experiments on 12 cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) show DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models, identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences.

Conclusion: DCMIL enables efficient cancer prognosis from WSIs without dense annotations, demonstrates superior performance across multiple cancer types, and has potential to generate new biological insights about tumor morphology.

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

### [155] [Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14431)
*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A neural video compression framework that unifies intra and inter coding with simultaneous two-frame compression, achieving 10.7% BD-rate reduction over DCVC-RT while maintaining real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing neural video compression schemes have limitations in handling disocclusion, new content, and interframe error propagation. The paper aims to eliminate these issues by borrowing the intra coding concept from classic video coding.

Method: Proposes an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding using a single model trained for adaptive coding. Introduces simultaneous two-frame compression to exploit both forward and backward interframe redundancy.

Result: Outperforms DCVC-RT by 10.7% average BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and maintains real-time encoding/decoding performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses limitations of existing NVC schemes and achieves superior compression efficiency while handling disocclusion and error propagation naturally.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A minimally distorted universal adversarial attack for video object detection using nuclear norm regularization and adaptive optimistic exponentiated gradient optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based object detection is crucial for safety-critical applications but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially universal perturbations that can fool detectors across multiple frames.

Method: Proposed attack uses nuclear norm regularization to create structured perturbations concentrated in the background, optimized with an adaptive optimistic exponentiated gradient method for efficiency and convergence.

Result: The attack outperforms low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

Conclusion: The proposed method provides an efficient and effective universal adversarial attack for video object detection with minimal distortion.

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

*Youwan Mahé,Elise Bannier,Stéphanie Leplaideur,Elisa Fromont,Francesca Galassi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This scoping review synthesizes 49 studies (2018-2025) on unsupervised deep generative models for brain anomaly detection, covering autoencoders, VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models applied to MRI/CT for various pathologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of supervised methods that require large annotated datasets and are limited to well-characterized pathologies, by exploring unsupervised generative models that can be trained on healthy data alone.

Method: PRISMA-guided scoping review analyzing 49 studies using unsupervised deep generative models including autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models for brain anomaly detection.

Result: Generative models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions and showed progress in detecting subtle abnormalities. They can produce interpretable pseudo-healthy reconstructions, which is valuable for rare or heterogeneous diseases with scarce annotated data.

Conclusion: Unsupervised generative models offer a compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning, biomarker discovery, and cross-disease mapping. Future work should focus on anatomy-aware modeling, foundation models, appropriate evaluation metrics, and clinical validation.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

*Thomas Katraouras,Dimitrios Rafailidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MIR-L, a compression strategy for multi-task image restoration models that discovers highly sparse subnetworks through iterative pruning, achieving 90% parameter reduction while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-task image restoration models are computationally inefficient due to high parameter counts, negatively impacting deployment on web platforms where image quality is critical for user experience.

Method: Uses iterative pruning strategy to remove low-magnitude weights across multiple rounds while resetting remaining weights to original initialization, uncovering "winning tickets" in overparameterized models.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows MIR-L retains only 10% of trainable parameters while maintaining high performance on deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks across benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed compression strategy effectively reduces computational burden of multi-task image restoration models while preserving or even enhancing their performance, making them more practical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a method for detecting seasonal grazing using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery with CNN-LSTM models, achieving 77% F1 score and demonstrating practical utility for conservation compliance monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grazing monitoring is crucial for both agriculture and biodiversity conservation, but scalable monitoring methods are limited. Current approaches lack the ability to efficiently detect where grazing occurs across large areas.

Method: Used Sentinel-2 L2A time series data from April-October for binary prediction (grazed/not grazed). Trained an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features from polygon-defined field boundaries.

Result: Achieved average F1 score of 77% across five validation splits, with 90% recall on grazed pastures. Model prioritization yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection when inspectors can visit only 4% of sites annually.

Conclusion: Coarse-resolution, freely available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for conservation-aligned land-use compliance, making grazing monitoring more scalable and efficient.

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made

TL;DR: Vision Mamba is introduced as a backbone for permeability prediction in 3D porous media, offering linear scaling with image resolution vs ViT's quadratic scaling, and fewer parameters than CNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage Vision Mamba's computational efficiency (linear scaling with resolution) and parameter efficiency compared to ViTs and CNNs for permeability prediction in 3D porous media.

Method: Used Vision Mamba as backbone network for permeability prediction, compared with ViT and CNN models, and conducted ablation studies to analyze component effects on accuracy.

Result: Demonstrated practical advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in permeability prediction of 3D porous media.

Conclusion: Vision Mamba has potential to be integrated into large vision models as an alternative to ViTs, with source code made available for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

### [162] [Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526)
*Yunze Tong,Didi Zhu,Zijing Hu,Jinluan Yang,Ziyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A noise projector is proposed to refine initial noise in Stable Diffusion before denoising, improving text-image alignment by addressing training-inference mismatch without modifying the SD model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address misalignment in text-to-image generation caused by training-inference mismatch where training uses prompt-specific noise while inference uses prompt-agnostic Gaussian noise.

Method: Use a noise projector that maps initial noise to prompt-aware counterparts using text-conditioned refinement, trained via VLM feedback distillation and quasi-direct preference optimization.

Result: Improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts with small inference cost, replacing multi-sample selection with single forward pass.

Conclusion: Prompt-aware noise projection effectively bridges training-inference gap in Stable Diffusion, enhancing alignment without model modifications or reference images.

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

*Keima Abe,Hayato Muraki,Shuhei Tomoshige,Kenichi Oishi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA is a domain harmonization framework for brain MR images that uses pseudo-linear style encoding and adversarial training to disentangle domain-invariant and domain-specific features while maintaining interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical images show domain shifts across imaging sites due to scanner differences, degrading ML performance. Existing domain harmonization methods lack interpretability, which is essential for medical applications.

Method: Uses two encoders to extract domain-invariant and domain-specific features, a decoder for reconstruction, and a domain predictor. Employs adversarial training and reconstructs input by summing reconstructions from both feature types.

Result: Achieves equal or better performance than prior methods in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. Enables visualization of both domain-independent and domain-specific components.

Conclusion: PL-SE-ADA provides an interpretable framework for domain harmonization that preserves disease-relevant information while offering high interpretability across the entire system.

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

### [166] [Exploring Image Representation with Decoupled Classical Visual Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14536)
*Chenyuan Qu,Hao Chen,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSplit is a framework that decomposes images into classical visual descriptors (edges, color, intensity) and uses them as complementary components for modern learning, enabling interpretable image understanding and attribute control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between opaque deep learning representations and interpretable classical visual descriptors by exploring whether modern learning can benefit from classical visual cues.

Method: A reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme that explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating each as independent but complementary components of visual knowledge.

Result: The method learns to capture the essence of each visual descriptor while preserving interpretability, and facilitates effective attribute control in advanced visual tasks like image generation and editing.

Conclusion: VisualSplit demonstrates that explicitly decomposing visual attributes provides an effective new learning approach for visual understanding that extends beyond conventional tasks to advanced applications.

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

### [167] [Exploring Cross-Modal Flows for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14543)
*Ziqi Jiang,Yanghao Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMA proposes a multi-step cross-modal alignment method using flow matching to address limitations of one-step PEFT methods for complex datasets where modalities are highly entangled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods perform only one-step adjustment, which is insufficient for complex datasets where visual and textual features are highly entangled.

Method: Learn a cross-modal velocity field through flow matching alignment, using fixed coupling strategy for category correspondence, noise augmentation for data scarcity, and early-stopping solver for efficiency.

Result: FMA consistently yields significant performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, especially on challenging datasets, demonstrating superior alignment capability.

Conclusion: Multi-step adjustment through flow matching provides more precise and robust cross-modal alignment compared to one-step PEFT methods, particularly for complex datasets.

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

*Song Tang,Peihao Gong,Kunyu Li,Kai Guo,Boyu Wang,Mao Ye,Jianwei Zhang,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), a training-free prompt embedding editing method that suppresses scene-ID correlation in text-to-image models to reduce identity shift and improve consistent subject generation across diverse scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I models suffer from identity shift due to scene contextualization - the natural correlation between subject and scene context that models learn from training data. Existing methods require knowing all target scenes in advance, which is unrealistic for real-world applications.

Method: SDeC identifies and suppresses latent scene-ID correlation in ID prompt embeddings by quantifying SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight eigenvalues. It works per-scene without requiring prior knowledge of all target scenes.

Result: Experiments show SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity, outperforming previous methods that rely on unrealistic assumptions about target scenes.

Conclusion: SDeC provides a flexible, general solution for consistent T2I generation that works in real-world scenarios where prior knowledge of target scenes is unavailable or varies over time.

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BalanceGS is an algorithm-system co-design that optimizes 3D Gaussian Splatting training by addressing density allocation, computation workload, and memory access inefficiencies through heuristic density control, similarity-based sampling, and reordered memory mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS suffers from three critical inefficiencies: skewed density allocation during Gaussian densification, imbalanced computation workload during Gaussian projection, and fragmented memory access during color splatting.

Method: Three-level optimization: (1) Algorithm-level heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to balance point distributions; (2) System-level similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging with adaptive workload distribution; (3) Mapping-level reordering-based memory access strategy with restructured RGB storage.

Result: Achieves 1.44× training speedup on NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible quality degradation compared to standard 3DGS, while removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions.

Conclusion: BalanceGS effectively addresses the inefficiencies in traditional 3DGS training through algorithm-system co-design, significantly accelerating training while maintaining reconstruction quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

Result: Achieves mean re-identification accuracy improvement of approximately 1.97% points compared with the strongest baseline on the nuScenes dataset.

Conclusion: Curvature information incorporation and multi-branch feature learning are effective for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle re-identification.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer
geometric and contextual features that are well suited for the
re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline

*Matan Rusanovsky,Shimon Malnick,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel framework for pixel-level keypoint grounding that uses free-form descriptions and precise localization, trained on a new dataset and achieving superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models lack pixel-precise keypoint comprehension through natural language, being limited to object-level or region-level grounding.

Method: Two-component framework: Point Descriptor generates contextual keypoint descriptions, and Point Localizer regresses pixel coordinates. Trained on LlamaPointInPart dataset using GRPO optimization with frozen localizer as reward model.

Result: Superior performance compared to baseline models on the LlamaPointInPart dataset, demonstrating effective pixel-level keypoint grounding.

Conclusion: The bidirectional framework enables future applications in keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANCE is an image-to-video framework that improves object motion coherence using Instance Cues for dense motion guidance and Dense RoPE to preserve motion token salience, addressing bottlenecks in current video generation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation struggles with maintaining coherent object motion and interactions due to weak motion guidance from sparse human hints and optimization conflicts between appearance and motion.

Method: Uses Instance Cues to create dense 2.5D motion fields from sparse user inputs, and Dense RoPE to preserve motion token salience in token space. Also employs joint RGB + auxiliary-map prediction to separate structure from appearance.

Result: The approach reduces depth ambiguity, stabilizes optimization, and improves temporal coherence without requiring complex per-frame trajectory scripts.

Conclusion: STANCE effectively addresses key bottlenecks in video generation by providing better motion guidance and separating structure from appearance optimization, leading to more coherent object motion.

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

TL;DR: Wiki-PRF is a three-stage method for KB-VQA that improves multimodal query quality and retrieval relevance through visual tool invocation, multimodal knowledge retrieval, and relevance filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG approaches for KB-VQA struggle with multimodal query quality and retrieval relevance, limiting performance in knowledge-based visual question answering.

Method: Three-stage approach: Processing (dynamic visual tool invocation), Retrieval (multimodal knowledge retrieval), and Filtering (relevance filtering). Uses VLM trained with reinforcement learning using answer accuracy and format consistency as rewards.

Result: Achieves significant improvements of 36.0 and 42.8 on E-VQA and InfoSeek datasets, reaching state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Wiki-PRF effectively addresses KB-VQA challenges through its three-stage framework and reinforcement learning training, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This

### [177] [Shot2Tactic-Caption: Multi-Scale Captioning of Badminton Videos for Tactical Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14617)
*Ning Ding,Keisuke Fujii,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Shot2Tactic-Caption is a dual-branch framework for badminton video captioning that generates both shot-level action descriptions and tactic-level temporal descriptions of tactical executions, including interrupted and resumed tactics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactical understanding in badminton requires interpreting both individual actions and how tactics dynamically unfold over time, which existing captioning methods don't adequately address.

Method: Dual-branch design with visual encoder, spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and Transformer decoder for both shot and tactic captions. Includes Tactic Unit Detector and shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism using predicted tactic type and state as prompts via cross-attention.

Result: Framework effectively generates both shot and tactic captions. ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and shot-wise prompt structuring produces more coherent and accurate tactic captioning.

Conclusion: The proposed Shot2Tactic-Caption framework successfully addresses multi-scale tactical understanding in badminton, enabling comprehensive description of both individual actions and temporal tactical executions.

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

*Natan Bagrov,Eugene Khvedchenia,Borys Tymchenko,Shay Aharon,Lior Kadoch,Tomer Keren,Ofri Masad,Yonatan Geifman,Ran Zilberstein,Tuomas Rintamaki,Matthieu Le,Andrew Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVS is a plug-and-play method that reduces video token redundancy by pruning temporally static patches, enabling faster inference and longer video sequences without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models face scalability limitations due to quadratic processing costs of dense frame sequences, causing context limitations and latency issues with long videos.

Method: Efficient Video Sampling identifies and prunes temporally static patches (unchanged spatial regions across frames) while preserving positional identity, requiring no retraining or architectural changes.

Result: EVS reduces token count significantly, cuts LLM time-to-first-token by up to 4x with minimal accuracy loss, and when combined with uptraining, maintains full performance under aggressive pruning.

Conclusion: EVS enables scalable video-language understanding by improving efficiency-accuracy trade-offs without sacrificing quality, making long video processing practical.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

*Ming Gui,Johannes Schusterbauer,Timy Phan,Felix Krause,Josh Susskind,Miguel Angel Bautista,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok is a generative modeling framework that uses a single continuous latent token from self-supervised vision transformers for efficient image generation, achieving competitive results with minimal training costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address spatial redundancies in 2D latent spaces and reduce training costs while maintaining competitive generative performance.

Method: Fine-tune semantic token embedding from pre-trained SSL encoder, pair with generative decoder using flow matching objective, add cosine-similarity loss to preserve SSL space geometry.

Result: Achieves competitive class-conditional ImageNet generation and text-to-image synthesis on MS-COCO with extremely limited training budgets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned SSL representations can serve as compact and effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

*Jihyun Yu,Yoojin Oh,Wonho Bae,Mingyu Kim,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteeringTTA is a test-time adaptation framework that uses Feynman-Kac steering with diffusion models to adapt inputs for classification under distribution shifts, outperforming baselines on ImageNet-C without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based TTA methods rely on gradient guidance, which limits exploration and generalization across different distortion types in test-time adaptation scenarios.

Method: SteeringTTA adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation using rewards from pseudo-labels, maintaining multiple particle trajectories steered by cumulative top-K probabilities and entropy scheduling.

Result: On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without requiring any model updates or source data.

Conclusion: The proposed inference-only framework effectively balances exploration and confidence in test-time adaptation, demonstrating improved robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

*Xinyao Liao,Xianfang Zeng,Ziye Song,Zhoujie Fu,Gang Yu,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that uses in-context learning from unpaired video clips, followed by fine-tuning with minimal paired data, achieving superior performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets limits the development of instruction-based video editing, motivating the need for more efficient training approaches.

Method: Pretraining a foundation video generation model using in-context learning from ~1M unpaired video clips to learn basic editing concepts, then fine-tuning with fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend editing tasks and improve quality.

Result: The method achieves 12% improvement in editing instruction following and 15% improvement in editing quality compared to existing instruction-based video editing approaches, demonstrating superior instruction alignment and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: The proposed low-cost pretraining strategy effectively enables instruction-based video editing capabilities without requiring massive paired datasets, making video editing more accessible and efficient.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DBP-MAE integrates Decorrelated Backpropagation into MAE pre-training to accelerate convergence, reducing training time by 21.1% and carbon emissions by 21.4% while improving downstream segmentation performance by 1.1 mIoU points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAE pre-training of vision transformers provides strong performance but has high computational costs that make it impractical for time- and resource-constrained industrial settings.

Method: Integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, applying it selectively to the encoder to iteratively reduce input correlations at each layer for faster convergence.

Result: DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4%, and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points on ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning.

Conclusion: DBP can effectively reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training, confirming its applicability in real-world industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EuroMineNet is a comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining footprint mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery, covering 133 EU mining sites from 2015-2024 with expert-verified annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mining causes environmental degradation but existing monitoring datasets lack temporal depth and geographic scope, requiring better tools for sustainable resource management.

Method: Created EuroMineNet with annual Sentinel-2 observations and expert annotations, supporting two tasks: multitemporal mining footprint mapping and cross-temporal change detection using a novel CA-TIoU metric.

Result: Benchmarked 20 deep learning models showing GeoAI effectively identifies long-term environmental changes but struggles with short-term dynamics needed for timely mitigation.

Conclusion: EuroMineNet advances temporally consistent mining monitoring for sustainable land-use management and environmental resilience, released as open science resource.

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

*Md. Abdur Rahman,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Sami Azam,Asif Karim,Jemima Beissbarth,Amanda Leach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeCKD introduces a chain-based knowledge distillation framework where models learn progressively from predecessors, reducing data dependency and improving performance in limited-data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional KD suffers from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on strong teachers or large datasets, limiting effectiveness in real-world limited-data scenarios.

Method: Progressive distillation chain where each model learns from its predecessor and refines knowledge before passing forward, with each model trained on only a fraction of the dataset.

Result: Outperforms existing supervised methods across four otoscopic imaging datasets, with cumulative accuracy gains up to +23% over single backbone models. Generalizes well to other medical imaging modalities.

Conclusion: WeCKD enables effective learning with minimal supervision, reduces data dependency, and shows strong potential for real-world adoption in medical imaging applications.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models lack strong video temporal grounding and reasoning capabilities, limiting their effectiveness for real-world video understanding systems.

Method: Uses two novel visual tools: plug-and-play progress bar integration and high-efficiency highlighting tool, plus visuotemporal CoT that integrates cross-modality reasoning across video and text.

Result: Significant performance improvements on Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines for video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering.

Conclusion: The framework achieves compositional and interpretable reasoning process, demonstrating effective video temporal understanding without additional training.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

*Seungjoo Shin,Jaesik Park,Sunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel 3DGS compression framework that uses learned image priors to restore compression artifacts, achieving superior rate-distortion performance with less storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS compression methods lack learned priors, limiting further advances in rate-distortion trade-off despite considerable storage reduction.

Method: Uses a restoration network to model compression artifacts in image space between degraded and original Gaussians, with coarse rendering residuals as side information. Refines compressed Gaussians using restored image supervision.

Result: Achieves superior rate-distortion performance and outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods in rendering quality while requiring substantially less storage.

Conclusion: The framework effectively leverages learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation and is compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods.

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

TL;DR: Semi-automated whale detection in satellite imagery using statistical anomaly detection to flag spatial outliers, reducing expert inspection area by up to 99.8% while maintaining high recall rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional whale monitoring methods are expensive and difficult to scale. Automated detection in satellite imagery is challenging due to lack of annotated data, image variability, and pipeline costs.

Method: Statistical anomaly detection method that flags spatial outliers ('interesting points') paired with web-based labeling interface for expert annotation. No labeled training data required.

Result: Achieved recalls of 90.3% to 96.4% on benchmark scenes, reducing expert inspection area from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km (up to 99.8% reduction).

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable first step for machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space, with open-sourced pipeline available.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open

TL;DR: Proposes CFSAM, a cross-layer feature self-attention module that models multi-scale dependencies for object detection, achieving significant performance gains on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention methods focus on single or dual-layer features, missing rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations needed for detecting objects with large scale variations.

Method: CFSAM has three components: convolutional local feature extractor, Transformer-based global modeling unit for cross-layer interactions, and feature fusion mechanism to enhance original representations.

Result: Integrated into SSD300, CFSAM achieved 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules and accelerating convergence.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the importance of explicit cross-layer attention modeling for advancing multi-scale object detection without substantial computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing hierarchical classification methods assume complete fine-grained annotations, but real-world supervision varies in granularity due to image quality, annotator expertise, and task demands.

Method: Proposes free-grain learning with heterogeneous supervision, using CLIP to simulate realistic mixed-granularity labels, and develops methods with pseudo-attributes from vision-language models and semi-supervised learning for visual guidance.

Result: The proposed methods along with strong baselines substantially improve performance under mixed supervision conditions.

Conclusion: The ImageNet-F benchmark and proposed methods advance hierarchical classification under real-world constraints with varying supervision granularity.

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting across ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces datasets, with quantitative and qualitative evaluations showing accurate, interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: DEXTER provides an effective data-free framework for generating natural language explanations of visual classifiers, enabling comprehensive understanding of model decision processes and biases without requiring original training data.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

### [192] [LightQANet: Quantized and Adaptive Feature Learning for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14753)
*Xu Wu,Zhihui Lai,Xianxu Hou,Jie Zhou,Ya-nan Zhang,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightQANet introduces quantized and adaptive feature learning for low-light image enhancement, using a Light Quantization Module for structured light factor extraction and a Light-Aware Prompt Module for dynamic adaptation to varying lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing low-light image enhancement methods fail to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded pixel-level information, resulting in poor texture restoration, color inconsistency, and artifacts.

Method: Proposes LightQANet with two key components: Light Quantization Module (LQM) for explicit illumination factor extraction and quantification, and Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM) for dynamic guidance using learnable illumination priors.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on multiple low-light datasets, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves consistent and robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions by combining static illumination modeling with dynamic adaptation capabilities.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an unconditional diffusion model for reconstructing Martian terrain heightmaps with missing data, outperforming traditional interpolation methods in accuracy and perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mars terrain datasets have extensive missing values from satellite imagery, and current interpolation methods fail to preserve geometric coherence. Deep learning approaches used on Earth cannot be directly applied due to Mars' limited data availability.

Method: Uses an unconditional diffusion model trained on 12,000 augmented Martian heightmaps from NASA's HiRISE survey. Implements non-homogeneous rescaling to capture multi-scale terrain features before resizing to 128x128 resolution.

Result: Outperforms established methods (Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, Navier-Stokes) with 4-15% improvement in RMSE and 29-81% improvement in LPIPS perceptual similarity on 1000 test samples.

Conclusion: The diffusion model approach provides superior Martian terrain reconstruction compared to traditional void-filling techniques, enabling more reliable VR simulations for space exploration tasks.

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

*Zhang Nengbo,Hann Woei Ho,Ye Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A visual communication framework for MAV swarms using motion-based signaling inspired by honeybee waggle dance, with event cameras and SNN for decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional radio-based MAV communication suffers from spectrum congestion, jamming, and high power consumption, requiring alternative methods.

Method: MAVs convey information through flight patterns captured by event cameras, using four motion primitives as control symbols, decoded by event frame segmentation and SNN classification.

Result: Experimental results show accurate decoding and low power consumption, validating the framework's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed visual communication framework offers an energy-efficient alternative for MAV communication in constrained environments.

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

### [195] [CoT-PL: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Pseudo-Labeling for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14792)
*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL introduces chain-of-thought reasoning for open-vocabulary object detection, decomposing object understanding into three interpretable steps to improve pseudo-labeling quality in crowded/occluded scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current OVD methods rely on direct image-text matching but fail to handle semantically complex scenes with crowded or occluded objects, limiting robustness.

Method: Uses structured visual chain-of-thought reasoning with three steps: region perception, category recognition via zero-shot reasoning, and background grounding. Includes contrastive background learning to disentangle object and background features.

Result: Achieves 103.4% and 168.4% relative improvements in novel-class pseudo-label quality for crowded/occluded scenes, +7.7 AP50 on COCO and +2.9 mask AP on LVIS for novel classes.

Conclusion: CoT-PL sets new state-of-the-art by integrating reasoning steps and contrastive learning for robust open-vocabulary detection in complex visual contexts.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is an interpretable AI model that analyzes colorectal cancer histology images to predict patient survival by capturing continuous morphological variability, achieving superior prognostic performance compared to existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current foundation models in computational pathology overlook organ-specific morphological patterns that influence tumor behavior and patient outcomes. There's a need for models that can capture the incremental evolutionary processes of cancer development.

Method: PRISM incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within distinct morphologies to characterize phenotypic diversity. It was trained on 8.74 million histological images from 424 stage III colorectal cancer patients' surgical resection specimens.

Result: PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year overall survival (AUC=0.70, accuracy=68.37%, HR=3.34), outperforming CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed sex-agnostic robustness and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups.

Conclusion: PRISM successfully captures the continuous morphological variability in colorectal cancer that reflects incremental evolutionary processes, providing an interpretable AI approach for prognostic prediction with superior performance and robustness across patient subgroups.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

TL;DR: R-Super trains AI to segment tumors using medical reports instead of labor-intensive tumor masks, achieving comparable performance while enabling segmentation of previously unsupported tumor types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early tumor detection saves lives, but current AI training requires costly manual tumor masks. Medical reports contain rich tumor information but are underutilized for AI training.

Method: R-Super trains AI models to segment tumors by matching their descriptions in medical reports, using 101,654 reports to reduce dependency on manually drawn masks.

Result: Models trained on reports achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting 5 of 7 tumor types.

Conclusion: R-Super challenges the belief that large-scale tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing a scalable path for early detection across diverse tumor types.

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

### [198] [Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819)
*Ji Cao,Yu Wang,Tongya Zheng,Zujie Ren,Canghong Jin,Gang Chen,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRTraj is a novel trajectory representation learning framework that integrates environment perception and route choice modeling to address limitations of existing methods that treat trajectories as isolated sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trajectory representation learning methods overlook the influence of external environment and internal route choice behavior on trajectory formation, treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences.

Method: PRTraj uses an Environment Perception Module to capture multi-granularity environmental semantics from POI distributions, and a Route Choice Encoder that models road segment transitions as decision sequences to capture route choice behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate PRTraj's effectiveness, generalizability, and strong data efficiency with robust performance in few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: PRTraj successfully bridges the gap in trajectory representation learning by incorporating both environmental context and route choice behavior, demonstrating superior performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: Proposes fractional bits quantization (SHORT) to progressively reduce model precision from 32 to 4 bits while maintaining generation quality, enabling deployment of large generative models on smartphones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large generative models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to memory and computation constraints. Aggressive quantization addresses efficiency but degrades model quality.

Method: Fractional bits quantization approach that progressively reduces precision from 32 to 4 bits per parameter, exploiting fractional bits during optimization to preserve quality.

Result: SHORT yields improved quality on various diffusion models (SD3.5-Medium, Sana, PixArt, FLUX.1-schnell) with 4-7% lower FiD than standard QAT. Successfully deployed Sana on Samsung S25U with Snapdragon 8 Elite HTP.

Conclusion: Fractional bits quantization enables efficient deployment of large generative models on mobile devices while maintaining high generation quality.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

TL;DR: AI tumor segmentation faces data scarcity. Synthetic data matched performance with fewer real scans. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 created with 10,135 CT scans and 15,130 tumor instances across 6 organs, achieving +7-16% DSC improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of AI tumor segmentation due to lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets that require medical experts and are hard to create.

Method: Created AbdomenAtlas 2.0 - a large dataset of 10,135 CT scans with 15,130 tumor instances manually annotated by 23 radiologists across 6 organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, uterus), plus 5,893 control scans. Applied lessons from proprietary JHH dataset showing synthetic data can reduce real data needs.

Result: Achieved notable improvements: +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests compared to public datasets. Synthetic data enabled same performance with only 500 real scans vs 1,500 real scans alone.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws for more efficient model training. AbdomenAtlas 2.0 provides a strong foundation for training AI tumor segmentation models across multiple organs, significantly outperforming existing public datasets.

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Motivation: Existing VLA models lack 3D structure understanding needed for precise manipulation tasks.

Method: Augments VLA models with auxiliary depth prediction using quantized latent tokens from VQ-VAE encoder.

Result: Strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Depth-aware representations improve spatial perception and reasoning in VLA models.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Motivation: Current video generation models perform well in realistic scenarios but degrade in imaginative scenarios with rarely co-occurring concepts and long-distance semantic relationships that fall outside training distributions.

Method: Proposes ImagerySearch - a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both inference search space and reward function based on semantic relationships in the prompt. Also introduces LDT-Bench benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench across diverse prompt types.

Conclusion: ImagerySearch enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings, demonstrating effectiveness across diverse prompt types. LDT-Bench and code will be released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video

*Harsha Kotla,Arun Kumar Rajasekaran,Hannah Rana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that classifies skin lesions and quantifies ABCDE features for melanoma detection, providing interpretable feature trajectories from benign to malignant stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated skin lesion analysis remains challenging, and current deep learning methods lack interpretability of clinically relevant ABCDE features used by dermatologists.

Method: Proposed framework classifies skin lesions while quantifying scores for A (asymmetry), B (border irregularity), C (color variation), and D (diameter) features, and simulates evolution over time for E (evolving) aspect.

Result: Achieved 89% classification accuracy with melanoma AUC of 0.96; feature evaluation performed well for asymmetry, color variation, and diameter prediction, though border irregularity was more difficult to model.

Conclusion: The framework enables doctors to link ML diagnoses to clinically relevant ABCDE criteria, improving understanding of skin cancer progression through interpretable feature trajectories.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

*Mihai-Cristian Pîrvu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to combine multiple visual modalities using minimal human supervision, leveraging pre-trained experts and procedural combinations on raw videos through an autonomous data-pipeline. It uses PHG-MAE for multi-modal learning and achieves competitive results with a highly efficient model (<1M parameters) compared to much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The real world is inherently multi-modal, but traditional ML models are unimodal. Recent trends focus on bi-modality, but true world understanding requires integrating all independent modalities. The work aims to combine as many visual modalities as possible with little to no human supervision.

Method: Uses pre-trained experts and procedural combinations on raw videos through a fully autonomous data-pipeline. Employs PHG-MAE model designed for multi-modal data, which is efficiently distilled into a low-parameter model (<1M). Also deploys other off-the-shelf models like DPT for depth estimation.

Result: The distilled model (<1M parameters) achieves competitive results compared to models with ~300M parameters. Successfully deployed for real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices/webcams on commodity hardware, and for near real-time depth estimation.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that efficient multi-modal integration is feasible with minimal human supervision, achieving competitive performance with significantly reduced model size, enabling practical deployment on commodity hardware for real-time applications.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare the performance of open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks, as their potential in face recognition remains underexplored.

Method: Conducted systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs on several face recognition datasets including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW using similar protocols as existing models.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Free-Form HOI Generation to create diverse hand-object interactions beyond fixed grasping patterns, using a multi-level diffusion model with fine-grained semantic control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI generation research is limited to fixed grasping patterns tied to physical priors, failing to capture the diversity of daily hand-object interactions like pushing, poking, and rotating.

Method: Proposes TOUCH, a three-stage framework with a multi-level diffusion model that uses explicit contact modeling for conditioning, refined with contact consistency and physical constraints. Built on WildO2 dataset containing 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories.

Result: The method generates controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses limitations of existing HOI generation by enabling fine-grained semantic control for diverse free-form hand-object interactions beyond traditional grasping patterns.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing collision prediction methods fail to distinguish between ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment.

Method: BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end, with two variants: BADAS-Open (1.5k public videos) and BADAS1.0 (40k proprietary videos). The approach includes re-annotating benchmarks for ego involvement, adding consensus alert-time labels, and synthesizing negatives.

Result: BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and Nexar datasets, outperforming forward-collision ADAS baselines while producing more realistic time-to-accident estimates.

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision

We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that enables precise control in visual autoregressive text-to-image generation through Reference Attention modules, achieving high fidelity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While control mechanisms exist for diffusion models, achieving precise and flexible control within the visual autoregressive paradigm remains underexplored, creating a critical gap that needs to be addressed.

Method: Introduces ScaleWeaver with improved MMDiT blocks featuring Reference Attention modules that efficiently incorporate conditional information by discarding unnecessary image→condition attention, emphasizing parameter reuse, and using zero-initialized linear projections.

Result: Extensive experiments show ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation with precise control while achieving superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver provides a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm, balancing quality, control precision, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

*Logan Lawrence,Oindrila Saha,Megan Wei,Chen Sun,Subhransu Maji,Grant Van Horn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper proposes nlg2choice, a two-stage method for evaluating MLLMs on fine-grained visual classification tasks with hundreds to thousands of choices, addressing challenges in free-form response evaluation and computational efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods for MLLMs struggle with fine-grained visual classification tasks that have hundreds to thousands of highly related choices, and current approaches don't scale well for retrieval-based problems where computing probabilities over large choice sets is computationally expensive.

Method: The nlg2choice method uses a two-stage approach: first asking the MLLM an open-ended question with minimal constraints, then using text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. For retrieval settings, they compute probability of constrained responses with early stopping to improve throughput.

Result: The method shows improvement over seven fine-grained visual datasets in both classification and retrieval tasks, and maintains performance across various ways users can implement tasks in natural language.

Conclusion: The proposed nlg2choice approach effectively addresses the challenges of evaluating MLLMs on fine-grained visual classification with large choice sets, providing computational efficiency while maintaining strong performance across different task formulations.

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

*Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Anoop Cherian,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel semi-supervised video anomaly detection framework using Multimodal Large Language Models to detect complex object interaction anomalies with inherent explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD methods struggle with complex object interaction anomalies and lack explainability.

Method: Uses MLLMs to extract textual descriptions of object activities and interactions from nominal videos, then compares test videos to these descriptions for anomaly detection.

Result: Effectively detects complex interaction-based anomalies and achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.

Conclusion: The proposed MLLM-based framework provides explainable anomaly detection and can enhance traditional VAD methods' interpretability.

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model for Dense Video Object Captioning that jointly detects, tracks, segments, and captions object trajectories using synthetic captions generated from a VLM on extended datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous DVOC approaches use disjoint training strategies due to high manual annotation costs, leading to suboptimal performance. The authors aim to create an end-to-end solution by leveraging synthetic captions.

Method: Generate synthetic captions for spatio-temporally localized entities using a state-of-the-art VLM, extend LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with these captions (creating LVISCap and LV-VISCap), and train MaskCaptioner end-to-end on these datasets.

Result: MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three benchmarks: VidSTG, VLN, and BenSMOT, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses DVOC challenges through synthetic caption generation and end-to-end training, achieving superior performance across multiple benchmarks while reducing annotation dependency.

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt is a framework for video generation that uses dual spatio-temporal conditioning and a 3D scene memory to enable precise camera control while maintaining scene consistency across long video sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generation methods struggle with maintaining scene consistency and precise camera control when generating beyond temporal boundaries, as they often incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from past frames.

Method: Uses dual spatio-temporal conditioning with a 3D scene memory constructed via dynamic SLAM with dynamic masking to separate static geometry from moving elements. Projects static scene representation to target viewpoints for geometrically consistent warped views.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality while maintaining computational efficiency and motion realism.

Conclusion: The framework successfully enables long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control in video generation by leveraging 3D scene representations and dynamic element separation.

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with gated linear attention and RMSNorm for whole-body multi-modal human motion generation, outperforming previous methods across text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various modalities (text, speech, music) into a cohesive framework, overcoming limitations of previous discrete masked modeling and autoregressive approaches.

Method: Developed a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with causal attention for sequential motion. Introduced gated linear attention and RMSNorm modules to focus on key actions and suppress instability. Used DiT structure to diffuse conditions from transformer to targets, and leveraged AdaLN and cross-attention to fuse text, speech, and music signals.

Result: Experimental results demonstrate that the framework outperforms previous methods across all modalities including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.

Conclusion: The proposed continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with multimodal fusion capabilities effectively addresses whole-body motion generation challenges and shows superior performance across multiple modalities.

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video generative models struggle with generating complex, natural motions that are smooth and contextually consistent, limiting their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

Method: RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function, using real-world videos as positive samples and contrasting them with erroneous model outputs to enable iterative self-correction. The method is supported by RealAction-5K, a curated dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities.

Result: Extensive experiments show that RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.

Conclusion: RealDPO effectively addresses the motion synthesis challenge in video generation by leveraging real-world data for preference learning, enabling more accurate and realistic motion generation.

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Motivation: LLMs struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that require visual aids, and existing VCoT approaches are limited by rigid tools or poor diagram quality.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Visual Manipulation pre-training on 15.2M caption-to-diagram pairs and editing trajectories, 2) Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning fine-tuning on 219K interleaved visual-textual reasoning examples.

Result: BAGEL-Canvas model achieves 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench and shows excellent generalization to other math benchmarks.

Conclusion: MathCanvas provides a complete toolkit to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs for mathematical problem-solving.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and

*Shizun Wang,Zhenxiang Jiang,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D is a framework that extends 3D reconstruction to 4D (dynamic scenes) by leveraging temporal correspondences including optical flow and point tracking to handle moving objects in monocular videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods work well for static scenes but fail with dynamic scenes because moving objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, leading to inaccurate reconstructions.

Method: C4D captures short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking, trains a dynamic-aware point tracker to identify motion masks, and introduces dynamic scene optimization objectives to recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters while lifting 2D trajectories to smooth 3D trajectories.

Result: The framework achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across multiple downstream tasks including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and point tracking.

Conclusion: C4D successfully extends 3D reconstruction to dynamic 4D scenes by leveraging temporal correspondences, enabling robust reconstruction of moving objects in monocular videos.

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Token-wise Attention integrated diffusion model for precipitation nowcasting that captures multi-scale spatio-temporal dependencies without needing separate latent modules, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of existing diffusion-based precipitation nowcasting models that suffer from scalability issues - latent-space approaches require separate autoencoders adding complexity, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms.

Method: Integrates Token-wise Attention into both the U-Net diffusion model and spatio-temporal encoder to dynamically capture multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution, eliminating the need for separate latent modules while avoiding high computational costs.

Result: Extensive experiments show the method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed Token-wise Attention integrated diffusion model provides an effective solution for precipitation nowcasting that balances computational efficiency with strong spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

### [218] [ChangingGrounding: 3D Visual Grounding in Changing Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14965)
*Miao Hu,Zhiwei Huang,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang,Dahua Lin,Nanning Zheng,Runsen Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark for 3D visual grounding in changing scenes, and proposes Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method that uses memory-driven exploration and multi-view fusion to localize objects efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D visual grounding methods assume static, reconstructed point clouds, requiring costly re-scans that hinder real-world deployment. The authors argue for formulating 3DVG as an active, memory-driven problem to handle changing scenes.

Method: Proposes Mem-ChangingGrounder: identifies object type from query, retrieves relevant memories to guide actions, explores target efficiently, falls back when needed, performs multi-view scanning, and fuses evidence from multiple views to get accurate bounding boxes.

Result: Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy on the ChangingGrounding benchmark while significantly reducing exploration cost compared to other baselines.

Conclusion: The benchmark and method aim to catalyze a shift toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications where scenes constantly change.

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

*Hengyuan Xu,Wei Cheng,Peng Xing,Yixiao Fang,Shuhan Wu,Rui Wang,Xianfang Zeng,Daxin Jiang,Gang Yu,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses copy-paste artifacts in identity-consistent image generation by creating a large-scale dataset, introducing a benchmark, and proposing a contrastive identity loss method that balances identity fidelity with diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current identity-consistent generation models suffer from copy-paste artifacts where they replicate reference faces instead of preserving identity across natural variations, limiting controllability and expressive power.

Method: Constructed MultiID-2M dataset for multi-person scenarios, introduced a benchmark to quantify copy-paste artifacts, and proposed a training paradigm with contrastive identity loss using paired data.

Result: WithAnyone model significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, maintains strong perceptual quality, and achieves high identity fidelity with expressive generation.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively mitigates copy-paste artifacts while preserving identity similarity, enabling more controllable and expressive identity-consistent image generation.

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

*Shaowei Liu,Chuan Guo,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator is a framework that uses close-proximity human-human interactive poses to generate versatile interaction animations through two conditional diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human can intuitively infer context and anticipate dynamics from close-proximity interactive poses, leveraging strong priors of human behavior.

Method: Uses two conditional diffusion models: (1) pose animator for generating dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses using temporal prior, (2) pose generator for synthesizing interactive poses from single pose, text, or both using spatial prior.

Result: Supports diverse tasks including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, transferring interaction knowledge from mocap data to open-world scenarios.

Conclusion: Empirical experiments demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of the framework across diverse datasets and applications.

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra is a native 3D world model that represents environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space using point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder and sparse point flow matching, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction and generation with high 3D consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world models rely on pixel-aligned representations that neglect the inherent 3D nature of the physical world, undermining 3D consistency and modeling efficiency.

Method: Proposes P2G-VAE that encodes 3D inputs into latent point representation decoded as 3D Gaussian primitives, and SPFlow network for generating latent point representation by denoising positions and features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet v2 indoor scenes in both reconstruction and generation with high 3D consistency, enabling exact multi-view consistency and flexible rendering from any viewpoint.

Conclusion: Terra demonstrates that native 3D representation enables explorable world modeling with superior 3D consistency and efficiency compared to pixel-aligned approaches.

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new training paradigm for image editing diffusion models that eliminates the need for paired data by using vision-language model feedback and distribution matching loss for direct optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current image editing models rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs, which are hard to curate at scale. Synthetic training pairs can propagate artifacts from pretrained models.

Method: Directly optimizes few-step diffusion models by unrolling during training and leveraging VLM feedback. Uses VLM to evaluate if edits follow instructions and preserve content, providing gradients for optimization. Incorporates distribution matching loss (DMD) for visual fidelity.

Result: Performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data in few-step setting. Outperforms RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO when using the same VLM as reward model.

Conclusion: The method successfully eliminates the need for paired data while achieving competitive performance with supervised approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of direct optimization with VLM feedback and distribution constraints.

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

TL;DR: The paper introduces NEO, a family of native Vision-Language Models that overcome limitations of modular VLMs by integrating vision and language capabilities within a unified architecture, achieving competitive performance with only 390M training examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fundamental constraints of native VLMs compared to modular ones and democratize research by making native VLM development more accessible and scalable.

Method: Developed NEO using guiding principles: (i) align pixel and word representations in shared semantic space, (ii) integrate strengths of separate vision/language modules, (iii) embody cross-modal properties for unified encoding, aligning, and reasoning.

Result: NEO rivals top-tier modular VLMs across diverse real-world scenarios while efficiently developing visual perception from scratch with only 390M image-text examples.

Conclusion: NEO serves as a cornerstone for scalable native VLMs with reusable components that create a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem for future research.

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising
contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and
training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread
exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs
apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

*Hadi Alzayer,Yunzhi Zhang,Chen Geng,Jia-Bin Huang,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion sampling method for multi-view consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D models, avoiding lengthy 3D optimization through implicit 3D regularization and coupled sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 2D image editing models produce high-quality edits but lack consistency across multiple views of 3D scenes, while 3D optimization approaches are slow and unstable with sparse views.

Method: Coupled diffusion sampling that concurrently samples from multi-view and 2D edited image distributions, using a coupling term to enforce multi-view consistency without explicit 3D representations.

Result: Validated on three multi-view image editing tasks, showing effectiveness and generality across various model architectures.

Conclusion: The framework provides a general solution for multi-view consistent editing that works with existing 2D models without lengthy optimization.

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

Conclusion: Provides robust, adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, reduces annotation burden, and matches user preferences through self-evolution and personalized workflows.

Abstract: Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains
difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and
limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent
framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist
vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool
$\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The
system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly
using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool
expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by
existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling
self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation
benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over
state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new
datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models.
It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative
text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting
performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust,

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STDW enhances gradual domain adaptation with dynamic weighting that balances source and target domain losses using a time-varying parameter, improving robustness and knowledge migration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in gradual domain adaptation where traditional methods suffer from inefficient knowledge migration and incomplete intermediate data during domain shift.

Method: Self-training with dynamic weighting mechanism using time-varying hyperparameter ϱ to adaptively balance source and target domain loss contributions during training.

Result: Outperforms existing baselines on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and Cover Type dataset; ablation studies confirm dynamic scheduling's critical role.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical insights and practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation with applications in dynamic real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

### [227] [Weight Weaving: Parameter Pooling for Data-Free Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13921)
*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weight Weaving is a data-free model merging technique that pools weights across scaling factor search space using pooling functions, eliminating the need for evaluation data and improving performance of existing merging methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model merging approaches depend on scaling hyperparameters that require privileged evaluation data for tuning, which is impractical in real-world scenarios. There's a need for principled data-free methods to set scaling factors.

Method: Weight Weaving pools model weights across lambda values search space using user-defined pooling functions (averaging, random selection, or existing merging methods). It's modular, imposes minimal constraints, and operates orthogonally to existing methods.

Result: Validated across three ViT variants in multi-task learning, continual learning, and domain generalization. Consistently improved performance of several model merging methods, achieving up to 15.9 percentage points accuracy gains in data-free setting.

Conclusion: Weight Weaving provides an effective data-free solution for model merging that eliminates evaluation data requirements while enhancing performance of existing merging techniques across various experimental setups.

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

### [228] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces Distributional Consistency (DC) loss as a new data-fidelity objective for inverse problems that replaces pointwise matching with distribution-level calibration, preventing overfitting to noise while maintaining compatibility with modern regularizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional data-fidelity loss functions like MSE lead to overfitting to measurement noise because they seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements. The authors aim to develop a more statistically grounded approach that evaluates data-fidelity collectively by testing statistical consistency with noise distributions.

Method: The proposed DC loss evaluates data-fidelity by testing whether observed measurements are statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by current estimates. It uses model-based probability scores for each measurement and serves as a plug-in replacement for standard data consistency terms.

Result: In image denoising with deep image prior, DC loss eliminates the need for early stopping and achieves higher PSNR. In medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, it reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances hand-crafted regularization efficacy.

Conclusion: DC loss provides a statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional fidelity losses for inverse problems, particularly effective when measurement-noise distributions are known and datasets contain many independent noisy values.

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

### [229] [Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reversible Model Merging (RMM) is a new approach that constructs a compact basis for model weights instead of collapsing all adapters into one set, allowing recovery of original task-specific models via linear combination and outperforming conventional merging methods for low-rank compressed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional model merging methods applied to low-rank weights (from LoRA or SVD compression) lead to severe performance degradation, motivating the need for a fundamentally different approach that can preserve individual model performance.

Method: RMM reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model. It provides a closed-form solution for selecting optimal basis weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination, allowing reversible recovery of individual models.

Result: Extensive experiments show RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches and preserves the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin across diverse datasets and model scales.

Conclusion: RMM enables efficient, data-free, and flexible model merging that maintains the ability to revert to specialized task-specific models when needed, recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform specialized models.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

*Amel Abdelraheem,Alessandro Favero,Gerome Bovet,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to remove backdoor attacks from foundation models without compromising their general capabilities, leveraging the disentanglement of backdoor representations in weight space.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and backdoors, but retraining is impractical due to their scale. Existing removal methods degrade performance on other tasks, so the authors investigate whether backdoors can be removed without affecting general capabilities.

Method: The authors found that backdoors are disentangled from benign tasks in weight space. They introduce an unlearning method that isolates and erases the backdoor's influence using this disentanglement, working with both known attacks and reverse-engineered triggers.

Result: The method achieves approximately perfect unlearning while retaining 96% of clean accuracy on average. It works effectively even when the attack details are unknown, using reverse-engineered triggers, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses.

Conclusion: Backdoors in foundation models can be effectively removed without compromising general capabilities by leveraging their disentangled representation in weight space, providing a practical solution to model safety concerns.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

### [231] [pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974)
*Hansheng Chen,Kai Zhang,Hao Tan,Leonidas Guibas,Gordon Wetzstein,Sai Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: π-Flow introduces policy-based flow models that predict dynamic flow velocities for fast ODE integration, achieving state-of-the-art few-step generation with improved quality-diversity trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing few-step diffusion/flow models suffer from complex distillation procedures and quality-diversity trade-offs due to format mismatch between teacher and student models.

Method: Modifies student flow model output to predict network-free policies that generate dynamic flow velocities for future substeps, enabling fast ODE integration without extra network evaluations. Uses imitation distillation with ℓ₂ flow matching loss to align policy trajectories with teacher behavior.

Result: Achieves 1-NFE FID of 2.85 on ImageNet 256², outperforming MeanFlow. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, substantially improves diversity while maintaining teacher-level quality.

Conclusion: π-Flow enables stable, scalable training and avoids quality-diversity trade-off through simple teacher imitation, achieving state-of-the-art few-step generation performance.

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.

*Mohammad Mansoori,Amira Soliman,Farzaneh Etminani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper proposes a novel approach to ICD code assignment by treating it as both classification and ranking task, focusing on code order importance which was ignored by previous classification-only methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art methods treat ICD code assignment as pure classification, ignoring the essential ordering of codes that matters for medical diagnosis and reimbursement purposes.

Method: The authors approach ICD code assignment from a retrieval system perspective, formulating it as a combined classification and ranking task to preserve code order.

Result: The proposed model achieves 47% accuracy in ranking primary diagnosis codes (vs 20% for SOTA classifier) and superior F1 scores (micro-F1: 0.6065 vs 0.597, macro-F1: 0.2904 vs 0.2660).

Conclusion: The retrieval-based framework effectively addresses code ordering in ICD assignment, demonstrating superior performance in identifying high-priority codes while maintaining competitive classification metrics.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

TL;DR: BitNet Distillation (BitDistill) is a lightweight pipeline that converts full-precision LLMs into 1.58-bit ternary weight models for specific tasks, achieving comparable performance with 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient deployment of large language models on resource-constrained devices by creating highly compressed models that maintain strong task-specific performance while drastically reducing computational costs.

Method: Combines three key techniques: SubLN module from BitNet, multi-head attention distillation based on MiniLM, and continual pre-training as a warm-up step to bridge performance gaps between full-precision and 1.58-bit models.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to full-precision models across different model sizes while enabling up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs.

Conclusion: BitDistill provides an effective approach for creating highly efficient ternary weight LLMs that maintain strong task performance while significantly reducing computational requirements, making LLMs more accessible for deployment on resource-limited hardware.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

Motivation: Address critical annotation backlogs in financial services where millions of customer utterances require accurate categorization, bridging the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems and practical enterprise deployment.

Method: Combines specialized agents with structured reasoning and judge-based consensus mechanism, supporting dynamic task adaptation through configuration (not code changes) for custom annotation types like FAQs, intents, entities, and domain-specific categories.

Result: Eliminated 1M utterance backlog with 86% agreement with human annotators, saving 5,000+ hours annually. Achieved 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1 over baselines. Confidence classifications: 85% high, 10% medium, 5% low.

Conclusion: MAFA provides a blueprint for organizations facing annotation challenges, demonstrating consistent improvements across multiple datasets and languages while enabling human annotators to focus on ambiguous cases through effective multi-agent collaboration.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Competitive programming like IOI is a key benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities, but achieving gold medal performance with open-weight models remains challenging while proprietary models claim such results with undisclosed methods.

Method: Combines large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and round-robin submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under limited validation budgets.

Result: GenCluster achieves gold medal performance at IOI 2025 using open-weight model gpt-oss-120b, showing consistent performance scaling with available compute and narrowing the gap between open and closed systems.

Conclusion: Sets a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible evaluation of reasoning in LLMs by demonstrating gold medal IOI performance with open-weight models for the first time.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can

TL;DR: CAST is a probe-free framework that analyzes transformer layers through direct transformation matrix estimation and spectral analysis, revealing distinct behaviors between encoder and decoder models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the black-box nature of large language models by providing complementary interpretability insights through direct analysis of transformer layer functions.

Method: Uses Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to estimate realized transformation matrices for each layer, then applies spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics to characterize layer behavior.

Result: Decoder models show compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank processing; kernel analysis reveals three distinct layer phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

Conclusion: CAST provides novel insights into transformer layer functions and reveals systematic differences between encoder and decoder architectures through spectral analysis.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

*Andrew Zhao,Reshmi Ghosh,Vitor Carvalho,Emily Lawton,Keegan Hines,Gao Huang,Jack W. Stokes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper presents the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization, showing systems are more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than injected queries, with feedback-based attacks increasing attack success rate by up to 48%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM systems now power everyday AI applications where performance depends on carefully designed prompts. While LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce manual effort by refining prompts from scored feedback, the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined.

Method: Used HarmBench to analyze poisoning risks, introduced a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model, and proposed a lightweight highlighting defense.

Result: Feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to ΔASR = 0.48. The fake-reward attack significantly increases vulnerability, while the highlighting defense reduces fake-reward ΔASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization pipelines represent a first-class attack surface, motivating stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

TL;DR: AEPO is an agentic RL algorithm that balances entropy in rollout and policy update phases to prevent training collapse caused by excessive entropy reliance in tool-use web agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mainstream agentic RL algorithms rely heavily on entropy signals for exploration, but this excessive reliance can impose constraints and lead to training collapse in multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use scenarios.

Method: AEPO consists of two components: (1) dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism with entropy pre-monitoring, adaptive budget allocation, and branch penalty; (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization with stop-gradient operations and entropy-aware advantage estimation.

Result: AEPO outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms across 14 datasets. With Qwen3-14B and just 1K RL samples, achieves 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5.

Conclusion: AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training by effectively balancing entropy in both rollout and policy update phases.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper shows that comparable reasoning capabilities to RL-posttraining can be achieved from base LLMs at inference time through pure sampling using a simple iterative algorithm inspired by MCMC techniques, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether reasoning capabilities comparable to RL-posttraining can be elicited from base models at inference time through pure sampling, without additional training, datasets, or verifiers.

Method: Proposed a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging base models' own likelihoods, inspired by MCMC techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions.

Result: The algorithm offers substantial reasoning boosts that nearly match and even outperform RL-posttraining on tasks like MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA, while avoiding diversity collapse characteristic of RL.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains without requiring training, curated datasets, or verifiers.

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

TL;DR: WeightLens and CircuitLens are new methods for automated neural network interpretability that analyze features through learned weights and circuit interactions, overcoming limitations of activation-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods rely on manual inspection, are limited to toy tasks, and automated approaches miss feature interactions while depending heavily on external LLMs and dataset quality.

Method: WeightLens interprets features directly from learned weights without explainer models or datasets. CircuitLens captures how feature activations arise from component interactions, revealing circuit-level dynamics.

Result: WeightLens matches or exceeds existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens identifies circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot detect.

Conclusion: These methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and quality.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

*Jonas Geiping,Xinyu Yang,Guinan Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new diffusion forcing sampler is developed for recurrent-depth language models, enabling parallel token refinement and achieving up to 5x speedup without tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language models, leveraging their similarities to accelerate generation while maintaining expressiveness.

Method: Developed a diffusion forcing sampler that decodes new tokens at every forward pass while allowing parallel refinement of latent states through recurrence, based on diffusion principles.

Result: The sampler provides strictly more expressive generation than autoregressive baselines with the same time budget, achieving up to 5x speedup when applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without tuning.

Conclusion: Recurrent-depth models can be viewed as strong continuous diffusion language models, and the proposed sampler efficiently parallelizes their extra computation at inference.

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

TL;DR: The paper introduces OmniFake dataset and UMFDet framework to detect both human-crafted misinformation and AI-generated fake content in multimodal posts, addressing the limitation of existing specialized systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current fake content detection systems are specialized for either human-written misinformation (NLP focus) or AI-generated content (CV focus), but real-world scenarios involve unknown deception types, requiring unified detection.

Method: Proposed UMFDet framework uses VLM backbone with Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts Adapter to capture category-specific cues and attribution chain-of-thought mechanism for implicit reasoning guidance.

Result: Extensive experiments show UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines.

Conclusion: UMFDet offers a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection by unifying detection of both human-crafted and AI-generated fake content.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI services are reactive, responding only to explicit commands. The authors argue that truly intelligent assistants should anticipate user needs and act proactively in daily life situations.

Method: Alpha-Service uses a multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses with five components: Input Unit (perception), Central Processing Unit (task scheduling), Arithmetic Logic Unit (tool utilization), Memory Unit (personalization), and Output Unit (human interaction).

Result: Case studies including a Blackjack advisor, museum tour guide, and shopping fit assistant demonstrate the system's ability to perceive environments, infer user intent, and provide timely assistance without explicit prompts.

Conclusion: Alpha-Service successfully enables proactive and real-time assistance, moving AI from passive tools to active companions that anticipate user needs in daily life scenarios.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Motivation: To test if large language models can learn creative machine design by assembling standardized components to meet functional requirements in physical simulation.

Method: Created BesiegeField testbed using the Besiege game for part-based construction and physical simulation. Benchmarked LLMs with agentic workflows and used reinforcement learning for finetuning with curated cold-start dataset.

Result: Current open-source LLMs show limitations in spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following for machine design tasks. RL finetuning shows promise but reveals ongoing challenges.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential for machine design but require improved capabilities in spatial reasoning and physical understanding, with RL offering a path forward despite remaining challenges.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

### [245] [Do Slides Help? Multi-modal Context for Automatic Transcription of Conference Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13979)
*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper presents a multi-modal ASR system that integrates visual information from presentation slides to improve speech recognition accuracy, particularly for domain-specific terminology in scientific presentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA ASR systems rely only on acoustic information and ignore multi-modal context, while visual information from slides is essential for disambiguation and adaptation in scientific presentations.

Method: Created a benchmark for multi-modal presentations, developed methods to augment speech models with multi-modal information, used data augmentation to overcome lack of datasets with slides, and trained models on the augmented dataset.

Result: Achieved 34% relative reduction in word error rate overall and 35% reduction for domain-specific terms compared to baseline model.

Conclusion: Integrating presentation slides as visual context significantly improves ASR performance, especially for domain-specific terminology in scientific presentations.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

### [246] [Generating Fair Consensus Statements with Social Choice on Token-Level MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14106)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multi-objective MDP framework for consensus statement generation that provides provable fairness guarantees using social choice theory principles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current consensus generation frameworks lack structure for provable fairness guarantees when aggregating diverse opinions, requiring a principled approach.

Method: Models the task as a multi-objective token-level MDP, uses social choice theory with two approaches: stochastic policy for ex-ante core guarantees and search algorithms for egalitarian welfare maximization.

Result: Empirical experiments show the egalitarian objective generates consensus statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline methods including Habermas Machine.

Conclusion: The MDP formulation combined with social choice theory provides a principled framework for fair consensus generation with provable guarantees.

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Terrarium framework is proposed as a testbed for studying safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based multi-agent systems, addressing risks like misalignment and malicious attacks through modular design and attack demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-powered multi-agent systems can automate user tasks but introduce new risks including misalignment, malicious attacks, data theft, and privacy concerns that need systematic study.

Method: Repurposed the blackboard design from early multi-agent systems to create a modular, configurable testbed called Terrarium, identifying key attack vectors and implementing three collaborative scenarios with four representative attacks.

Result: Developed a flexible framework that enables rapid prototyping, evaluation, and iteration on defenses and designs for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems by providing tools to systematically study and address safety, privacy, and security challenges.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

*Xikai Zhang,Bo Wang,Likang Xiao,Yongzhi Li,Quan Chen,Wenju Wu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IMAGINE framework integrates multi-agent system reasoning capabilities into a single compact model through end-to-end training, achieving superior performance on complex planning tasks while reducing model size and computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with complex reasoning and planning tasks, and while multi-agent systems can improve collective reasoning, they suffer from high computational costs, long latency, and training difficulties.

Method: Proposed IMAGINE framework that integrates multi-agent system reasoning and planning capabilities into a single compact model through simple end-to-end training.

Result: A Qwen3-8B-Instruct model trained with IMAGINE achieved 82.7% Final Pass Rate on TravelPlanner benchmark, significantly outperforming DeepSeek-R1-671B's 40% while being much smaller.

Conclusion: The IMAGINE framework enables small-scale models to acquire and surpass the structured reasoning capabilities of well-organized multi-agent systems through efficient end-to-end training.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

*Yuanyi Song,Heyuan Huang,Qiqiang Lin,Yin Zhao,Xiangmou Qu,Jun Wang,Xingyu Lou,Weiwen Liu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Jun Wang,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang,Zhaoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ColorBench is a graph-structured benchmarking framework that enables static simulation of dynamic mobile agent behaviors, addressing limitations of current evaluation methods by supporting multiple valid solutions and comprehensive capability analysis for complex long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile agent evaluation methods are inadequate - offline benchmarks only validate single predefined paths while online testing suffers from complexity and non-reproducibility issues, making both approaches insufficient for comprehensive assessment of agent capabilities on complex real-world mobile tasks.

Method: Developed a novel graph-structured benchmarking framework that models finite states from real-device interactions to achieve static simulation of dynamic behaviors. Created ColorBench with 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) averaging over 13 steps each, containing multiple correct paths and typical error paths for quasi-dynamic interaction.

Result: ColorBench enables evaluation of multiple valid solutions, subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis. Evaluation across various baselines revealed limitations of existing models and provided insights for improvement directions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework bridges the gap between offline and online evaluation, enhances testing stability, and provides a comprehensive assessment platform for mobile agents on complex long-horizon problems, with identified improvement directions and technical pathways for enhancing agent performance.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

TL;DR: TITAN is a framework that connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a structured knowledge graph using path planning and graph traversal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable automated reasoning about cyber threats by connecting natural language queries with structured knowledge graphs, overcoming limitations of traditional retrieval systems.

Method: Integrates a path planner model that predicts logical relation chains from text and a graph executor that traverses the TITAN Ontology (derived from MITRE) to retrieve factual answers with supporting evidence.

Result: Empirical evaluations show TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

Conclusion: TITAN provides an effective framework for automated cyber threat intelligence reasoning through structured knowledge graph traversal with natural language interface.

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

### [251] [Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846)
*Zhuo-Yang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A formal theory for measuring LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors, representing agents as fuzzy relation operators constrained by safety envelopes, with geometric interpretations of search difficulty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically encode domain priors into operationally structured hypothesis spaces for LLM-based iterative search, addressing the challenge of where to search effectively in reasoning and program discovery tasks.

Method: Proposes a compact formal theory representing agents as fuzzy relation operators constrained by safety envelopes, using continuation parameters to weight reachable paths and coverage generating functions to measure reachability difficulty.

Result: Developed a geometric interpretation of search on graphs induced by safety envelopes, with testable inferences validated through majority-vote instantiation.

Conclusion: The theory provides a workable language and operational tools to systematically measure agents and their search spaces, offering a formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

*Kyle Montgomery,Sijun Tan,Yuqi Chen,Siyuan Zhuang,Tianjun Zhang,Raluca Ada Popa,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid discriminative verification with self-consistency outperforms costly generative verification under fixed compute budgets, achieving up to 15.3% higher accuracy on AIME2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative verifiers for test-time scaling are computationally prohibitive, limiting practical deployment. The paper aims to find more budget-aware alternatives.

Method: Proposes discriminative verification combined with self-consistency in a hybrid approach, focusing on budget-aware test-time scaling rather than standalone discriminative verifiers.

Result: Under fixed compute budget, hybrid discriminative verification surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by up to 15.3% higher accuracy on AIME2025.

Conclusion: Budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is a practical, efficient alternative to costly generative techniques, serving as a 'free' upgrade over self-consistency.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

TL;DR: Systematic exploration of multimodal depression detection using EEG, speech, and text modalities, showing that trimodal models with pretrained embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in existing depression detection studies including limited scope, lack of systematic feature comparisons, and inconsistent evaluation protocols.

Method: Systematically evaluated feature representations (handcrafted vs pretrained embeddings), neural encoders, unimodal/bimodal/trimodal configurations, and fusion strategies with consistent subject-independent splits.

Result: Combination of EEG, speech and text enhances detection; pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features; carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: The work lays groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection through systematic benchmarking and analysis.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reinterprets Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a feedback stability theory, introducing H-Risk as a composite instability index. It shows this predicts overconfident errors in simulations and correlates with miscalibration/hallucination in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge Kantian philosophy with feedback control theory, providing a principled framework for diagnosing and reducing overconfidence in reasoning systems.

Method: Formalized Kant's intuition via H-Risk index combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. Tested in linear-Gaussian simulations and extended to LLMs.

Result: Higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability. In LLMs, fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration and hallucination. Critique-style prompts show mixed effects.

Conclusion: Establishes a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering diagnostic tools for reasoning system overconfidence. Preliminary version with future revisions planned.

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: PoissonNet is a novel neural architecture for mesh processing that uses Poisson's equation for feature propagation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation and surface deformation tasks while being efficient and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing mesh learning architectures face trade-offs between learning high-frequency features, receptive field size, discretization sensitivity, and computational efficiency. PoissonNet aims to overcome all these limitations.

Method: Uses a local-global learning scheme: applies learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain, then solves a Poisson system to propagate feature updates globally across the mesh surface.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation and parameterizing animated surfaces. Significantly outperforms existing architectures in learning deformations, with better efficiency and scalability.

Conclusion: PoissonNet provides an effective framework that preserves full frequency spectrum, offers global receptive field, is mesh-agnostic, and computationally efficient, making it suitable for large-scale mesh processing tasks.

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their
constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning
high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to
discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic
local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel
neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a
local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary
mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply
learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then
solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface
globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full
frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining
agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far
less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability --
both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples.
These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to
previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on
semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces.
Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn
deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that
learn on surfaces.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: Compositional Phase Diffusion generates smooth transitions between multiple motion clips by using semantic and transitional phase diffusion modules in the frequency domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion generation models create awkward transitions between multiple semantically generated motion clips, lacking continuity at boundaries.

Method: Uses Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module (TPDM) in latent motion frequency domain via Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE) to incorporate semantic guidance and phase details.

Result: Competitive performance in generating compositional motion sequences with semantic alignment and smooth phase transitions between clips; also enables motion inbetweening.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses transition continuity issues in compositional motion generation and shows potential for various applications.

Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in
generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when
employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple
semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the
continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,
resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these
challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the
Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module
(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from
adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM
operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the
pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them
to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from
variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate
the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating
compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input
conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding
and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made
possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed
throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the
proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios. Codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance accessibility of public-facing heritage guidance documents by integrating Generative AI into professional heritage practice.

Method: Developed HAZEL chatbot fine-tuned for heritage conservation and interpretation guidance, then compared its performance against ChatGPT-4 using quantitative assessments on guidance writing tasks.

Result: HAZEL showed slightly better performance than ChatGPT-4, indicating that fine-tuned LLMs are more effective, but significant limitations were noted in cultural sensitivity and advanced technical expertise.

Conclusion: While GenAI cannot replace human heritage professionals for technical authoring, it offers valuable benefits for automating and expediting certain aspects of guidance writing, especially in resource-constrained heritage organizations.

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of
enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed
HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance
relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative
assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a
series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this
comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT,
suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large
language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant
limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more
advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot
replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its
potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could
offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in

### [259] [Just-In-Time Objectives: A General Approach for Specialized AI Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14591)
*Michelle S. Lam,Omar Shaikh,Hallie Xu,Alice Guo,Diyi Yang,Jeffrey Heer,James A. Landay,Michael S. Bernstein*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method to automatically infer user objectives from passive behavior observation and optimize LLM outputs for those specific objectives, resulting in more responsive and desired tools and responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models often produce generic, cliche-filled outputs when not given specific objectives, failing to provide truly responsive and desired tools and interfaces.

Method: An architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI systems through generation and evaluation against these inferred objectives.

Result: In experiments with participants' own tasks, JIT objectives achieved 66-86% win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person sessions confirmed production of specialized tools unique to each participant.

Conclusion: Inferring and optimizing for just-in-time objectives enables LLMs to produce more responsive and desired outputs, creating specialized tools tailored to individual users' immediate needs.

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a
specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails
littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment
objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to
produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired.
We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time
objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI
systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing
just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution")
enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based
on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or
surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on
participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86%
win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT
objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

### [260] [Detecting Early and Implicit Suicidal Ideation via Longitudinal and Information Environment Signals on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14889)
*Soorya Ram Shimgekar,Ruining Zhao,Agam Goyal,Violeta J. Rodriguez,Paul A. Bloom,Hari Sundaram,Koustuv Saha*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: A computational framework that uses both user posting history and peer interactions improves early detection of implicit suicidal ideation on social media by 15% over individual-only approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation don't express it explicitly on social media, making early detection challenging. Current methods miss indirect signals that appear through everyday posts and peer interactions.

Method: Developed a framework modeling user's information environment including longitudinal posting history and socially proximal peers' discourse. Used composite network centrality to identify top neighbors, temporally aligned interactions, and integrated multi-layered signals using fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model.

Result: In a Reddit study with 1,000 users (500 cases and 500 controls), the approach improved early and implicit suicidal ideation detection by 15% over individual-only baselines.

Conclusion: Peer interactions provide valuable predictive signals for detecting implicit suicidal ideation, suggesting that early detection systems should capture both direct and indirect expressions of risk in online environments.

Abstract: On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not
disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly
through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals
early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a
forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that
models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal
posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We
adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a
user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions --
integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a
Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves
early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These
findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and
carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture
indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.

*Yushi Du,Yixuan Li,Baoxiong Jia,Yutang Lin,Pei Zhou,Wei Liang,Yanchao Yang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: COLA is a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach for compliant human-humanoid collaboration in carrying tasks, achieving 24.7% reduction in human effort and 27.4% improvement over baselines without external sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human-humanoid collaboration has great potential in healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing, but enabling compliant collaboration remains challenging due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics, which has been largely unexplored compared to robotic arm collaboration.

Method: Proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach that combines leader and follower behaviors in a single policy, trained in closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to implicitly predict object motion patterns and human intentions for coordinated trajectory planning.

Result: Simulation experiments show 24.7% reduction in human effort while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments demonstrate robust collaboration across various objects and movement patterns. Human user studies with 23 participants confirm 27.4% average improvement over baseline models.

Conclusion: The method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, providing a practical solution for real-world deployment across different terrains and objects.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

*Yao Zhong,Hanzhi Chen,Simon Schaefer,Anran Zhang,Stefan Leutenegger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GOPLA is a hierarchical framework for object placement that combines semantic reasoning and geometric feasibility, improving success rates by 30.04 percentage points over previous methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots need to perform object placement tasks in household settings, requiring reasoning about both semantic preferences (common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility (collision avoidance).

Method: Uses a multi-modal LLM to translate instructions into structured plans, spatial mapper for 3D affordance maps, diffusion-based planner for placement poses, and a scalable pipeline to expand human demonstrations into synthetic training data.

Result: Improves placement success rates by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up method, with strong generalization across real-world robotic placement scenarios.

Conclusion: GOPLA demonstrates effective hierarchical learning for object placement, successfully combining semantic and geometric reasoning with strong performance improvements.

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

### [263] [From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952)
*Zhe Li,Cheng Chi,Yangyang Wei,Boan Zhu,Yibo Peng,Tao Huang,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Shanghang Zhang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboGhost is a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents, bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting stages to enable faster, more reliable language-guided locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines are cumbersome, unreliable, and prone to cumulative errors due to multi-stage processing (motion decoding, retargeting, physics-based tracking), which introduces high latency and weak coupling between semantics and control.

Method: Uses a diffusion-based policy that denoises executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent. Incorporates a hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator to ensure long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity for precise humanoid behavior.

Result: Substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Framework naturally extends to other modalities like images, audio, and music.

Conclusion: RoboGhost provides a more direct pathway from language to action, eliminating fragile intermediate stages and serving as a general foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems with improved performance and reliability.

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

### [264] [RDD: Retrieval-Based Demonstration Decomposer for Planner Alignment in Long-Horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14968)
*Mingxuan Yan,Yuping Wang,Zechun Liu,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) to automatically decompose demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning visual features with low-level policy training data, improving hierarchical VLA frameworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based planners require fine-tuning with human-annotated or heuristic sub-tasks, which can deviate from visuomotor policy training data and degrade performance.

Method: Uses visual feature alignment between demonstration intervals and low-level policy training data to automatically decompose tasks into appropriate sub-tasks.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art sub-task decomposers on both simulation and real-world tasks, showing robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: RDD provides an effective automatic decomposition method that aligns better with low-level policy capabilities, improving hierarchical task execution.

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RL4Seg3D is an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D+time echocardiography segmentation that uses reinforcement learning to improve accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while providing uncertainty estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability issues in domain adaptation for medical image segmentation, particularly in spatio-temporal data like echocardiography where temporal consistency and anatomical validity are critical, and artifacts/noise hinder performance.

Method: Uses reinforcement learning with novel reward functions and fusion scheme to enhance landmark precision while processing full-sized echocardiographic videos, providing uncertainty estimation as a side effect.

Result: Outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos without requiring labels on the target domain.

Conclusion: RL4Seg3D effectively addresses domain adaptation challenges in echocardiography segmentation by improving accuracy, anatomical validity, temporal consistency, and providing useful uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling
knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert
annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target
domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where
accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further
exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can
significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in
echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder
segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an
unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography
segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to
enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized
input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our
approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while
also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator,
which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic
videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques
without the need for any labels on the target domain. Code is available at

### [266] [A Density-Informed Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Framework for Improving Breast Cancer Detection Across All Breast Densities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14340)
*Siva Teja Kakileti,Bharath Govindaraju,Sudhakar Sampangi,Geetha Manjunath*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A multi-modal AI framework combining mammography and thermal imaging (Thermalytix) dynamically selects the optimal modality based on breast density, achieving 94.55% sensitivity and 79.93% specificity, outperforming either modality alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mammography has reduced sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, leading to missed diagnoses. Thermal imaging provides complementary functional data that could improve detection accuracy.

Method: 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. A density-informed AI framework uses mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for dense breasts, with mammography analyzed via deep learning and thermal imaging via vascular/thermal radiomics.

Result: Multi-modal AI achieved 94.55% sensitivity and 79.93% specificity, outperforming standalone mammography AI (81.82% sensitivity) and Thermalytix AI (92.73% sensitivity). Mammography sensitivity dropped to 67.86% in dense breasts vs 96.30% in fatty breasts, while Thermalytix maintained ~92.6% sensitivity in both.

Conclusion: The density-informed multi-modal AI framework overcomes limitations of unimodal screening, delivers consistent high performance across breast compositions, and offers an interpretable, low-cost solution deployable in various healthcare settings.

Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced
sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or
delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures
functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic
structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting
the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of
324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images
were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix
assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed
framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for
dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI
framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity
of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI
(sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity
92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography
dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%),
whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both
(92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed
multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and
deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed
framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a
practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both
high-resource and resource-limited settings.
