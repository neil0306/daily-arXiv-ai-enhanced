### [1] [A Survey of Automatic Evaluation Methods on Text, Visual and Speech Generations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10019)
*Tian Lan,Yang-Hao Zhou,Zi-Ao Ma,Fanshu Sun,Rui-Qing Sun,Junyu Luo,Rong-Cheng Tu,Heyan Huang,Chen Xu,Zhijing Wu,Xian-Ling Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A review and unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generative AI outputs across text, images, and audio, identifying five fundamental paradigms and suggesting future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The lack of a systematic framework for evaluating generative AI outputs across text, visual, and audio modalities motivates this comprehensive review.

Method: The paper presents a unified taxonomy of evaluation methods, starting with text generation (most mature) and extending to image and audio generation.

Result: Five fundamental paradigms are identified to characterize evaluation approaches across text, image, and audio domains.

Conclusion: The paper highlights the need for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI
capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating
the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although
numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a
systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text,
visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive
review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated
content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms
that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our
analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where
techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio
generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss
promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation
methodologies.

### [2] [TaskCraft: Automated Generation of Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10055)
*Dingfeng Shi,Jingyi Cao,Qianben Chen,Weichen Sun,Weizhen Li,Hongxuan Lu,Fangchen Dong,Tianrui Qin,King Zhu,Minghao Yang,Jian Yang,Ge Zhang,Jiaheng Liu,Changwang Zhang,Jun Wang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaskCraft automates the creation of scalable, multi-tool agentic tasks to address the lack of tool interaction in existing instruction data and costly human annotation in benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic tasks are crucial for NLP and AI but suffer from limited scalability due to reliance on human annotation and lack of tool interaction in instruction data.

Method: TaskCraft uses depth-based and width-based extensions to generate complex, verifiable tasks with execution trajectories, producing a synthetic dataset of ~36,000 tasks.

Result: The tasks improve prompt optimization and enhance supervised fine-tuning of agentic foundation models.

Conclusion: TaskCraft provides a scalable solution for agentic task generation, supporting future research on agent tuning and evaluation.

Abstract: Agentic tasks, which require multi-step problem solving with autonomy, tool
use, and adaptive reasoning, are becoming increasingly central to the
advancement of NLP and AI. However, existing instruction data lacks tool
interaction, and current agentic benchmarks rely on costly human annotation,
limiting their scalability. We introduce \textsc{TaskCraft}, an automated
workflow for generating difficulty-scalable, multi-tool, and verifiable agentic
tasks with execution trajectories. TaskCraft expands atomic tasks using
depth-based and width-based extensions to create structurally and
hierarchically complex challenges. Empirical results show that these tasks
improve prompt optimization in the generation workflow and enhance supervised
fine-tuning of agentic foundation models. We present a large-scale synthetic
dataset of approximately 36,000 tasks with varying difficulty to support future
research on agent tuning and evaluation.

### [3] [A quantum semantic framework for natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10077)
*Christopher J. Agostino,Quan Le Thien,Molly Apsel,Denizhan Pak,Elina Lesyk,Ashabari Majumdar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores semantic degeneracy in language, showing that as expressions grow complex, recovering intended meaning becomes intractable. It uses LLMs to demonstrate non-classical contextuality in interpretation, advocating for Bayesian approaches over classical methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To challenge the classical view of linguistic meaning as intrinsic and to demonstrate the interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy on both humans and LLMs.

Method: The study employs Kolmogorov complexity arguments and conducts a semantic Bell inequality test using LLMs to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contexts.

Result: Experiments showed CHSH expectation values (1.2-2.8) violating classical boundaries, indicating non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation.

Conclusion: Classical frequentist approaches are inadequate; Bayesian repeated sampling is proposed for more accurate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language
that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of
potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in
complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face
inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language
itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by
semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as
an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent
(human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This
computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms
possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that
meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act.
To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM
agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs
under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we
found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several
runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical
boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under
ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from
human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical
frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily
lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can
provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic
meaning in context.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel multi-agent system, Chat-of-Thought, is introduced for generating FMEA documents using collaborative LLM-based agents and dynamic task routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in industrial equipment monitoring by optimizing FMEA document generation and validation.

Method: Uses multiple LLM-based agents with specific roles, dynamic task routing, and iterative refinement via multi-persona-driven discussions.

Result: Demonstrates potential for interactive, template-driven workflows and context-aware agent collaboration in FMEA generation.

Conclusion: Chat-of-Thought offers an innovative solution for industrial FMEA challenges through AI-driven collaboration.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel multi-agent system called Chat-of-Thought,
designed to facilitate the generation of Failure Modes and Effects Analysis
(FMEA) documents for industrial assets. Chat-of-Thought employs multiple
collaborative Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents with specific roles,
leveraging advanced AI techniques and dynamic task routing to optimize the
generation and validation of FMEA tables. A key innovation in this system is
the introduction of a Chat of Thought, where dynamic, multi-persona-driven
discussions enable iterative refinement of content. This research explores the
application domain of industrial equipment monitoring, highlights key
challenges, and demonstrates the potential of Chat-of-Thought in addressing
these challenges through interactive, template-driven workflows and
context-aware agent collaboration.

### [5] [When Meaning Stays the Same, but Models Drift: Evaluating Quality of Service under Token-Level Behavioral Instability in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10095)
*Xiao Li,Joel Kreuzwieser,Alan Peters*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper studies how large language models (LLMs) react to semantically equivalent but differently worded prompts, introducing Prompt-Based Semantic Shift (PBSS) to measure behavioral drift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how token-level differences in prompts affect LLM responses, despite identical semantic intent.

Method: Proposes PBSS, a framework applied to ten tasks, analyzing response shifts under reworded prompts.

Result: Finds consistent, model-specific shifts, linking them to tokenization and decoding dynamics.

Conclusion: Highlights overlooked instability in model evaluation due to prompt rephrasing, suggesting tokenization and decoding impact post-training quality.

Abstract: We investigate how large language models respond to prompts that differ only
in their token-level realization but preserve the same semantic intent, a
phenomenon we call prompt variance. We propose Prompt-Based Semantic Shift
(PBSS), a diagnostic framework for measuring behavioral drift in LLMs under
semantically equivalent prompt rewordings. Applied to ten constrained tasks,
PBSS reveals consistent, model-specific response shifts, suggesting statistical
regularities linked to tokenization and decoding. These results highlight an
overlooked dimension of model evaluation stability under rephrasing and suggest
that tokenization strategies and decoding dynamics may contribute to
post-training quality of service instability.

### [6] [ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116)
*Caijun Jia,Nan Xu,Jingxuan Wei,Qingli Wang,Lei Wang,Bihui Yu,Junnan Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChartReasoner is a two-stage framework for precise visual reasoning over charts, converting images to structured code and synthesizing reasoning data, outperforming open-source models with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending large language models' reasoning to visual tasks without losing critical structural and semantic information, especially in chart question answering.

Method: A code-driven two-stage framework: converting chart images to structured ECharts codes, then synthesizing reasoning data with a pretrained model and code validator. Training combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art open-source models with fewer parameters and approaches GPT-4o's performance in out-of-domain settings.

Conclusion: ChartReasoner effectively bridges the gap in visual reasoning, preserving chart details and enabling interpretable reasoning.

Abstract: Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities
through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this
capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing
multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into
textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose
critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations,
especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount
of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven
novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning
over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart
images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics
as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data
synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to
automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a
code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final
multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and
experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original
details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with
state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching
the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.

### [7] [Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139)
*Jiaxin Wen,Zachary Ankner,Arushi Somani,Peter Hase,Samuel Marks,Jacob Goldman-Wetzler,Linda Petrini,Henry Sleight,Collin Burns,He He,Shi Feng,Ethan Perez,Jan Leike*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), an unsupervised algorithm to fine-tune pretrained language models without human supervision, outperforming human-supervised methods on certain tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human supervision is inadequate for models with superhuman capabilities, necessitating an unsupervised approach.

Method: ICM fine-tunes models using their own generated labels, avoiding external supervision.

Result: ICM matches or outperforms human-supervised methods on tasks like GSM8k-verification and TruthfulQA, and improves frontier LM training.

Conclusion: ICM effectively elicits superhuman capabilities in models and enhances performance beyond human-supervised methods.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's
post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However,
for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get
high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new
unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune
pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without
external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward
modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden
supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On
tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit
those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally,
we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our
method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to
train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the
assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

### [8] [When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10150)
*Aakriti Kumar,Nalin Poungpeth,Diyi Yang,Erina Farrell,Bruce Lambert,Matthew Groh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper compares expert, crowdworker, and LLM annotations on empathic communication in conversations, finding LLMs approach expert reliability and outperform crowdworkers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how reliably LLMs judge empathic nuances compared to humans, using expert agreement as a benchmark.

Method: Comparing annotations from experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs across four evaluative frameworks applied to 200 real-world conversations.

Result: LLMs consistently approach expert-level reliability and exceed crowdworker reliability across all frameworks.

Conclusion: LLMs, validated with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency in emotionally sensitive applications like conversational companions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in
text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of
empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts,
crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative
frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and
communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares
a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert
annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess
inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that
expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components
depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert
agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM
performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks,
LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the
reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated
on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and
oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as
conversational companions.

*Bidyarthi Paul,SM Musfiqur Rahman,Dipta Biswas,Md. Ziaul Hasan,Md. Zahid Hossain*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores emotion analysis in Bangla using machine learning models (Linear SVM, KNN, Random Forest, BiLSTM, AdaBoost) and dimensionality reduction (PCA), with LIME for explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance sentiment analysis in understudied languages like Bangla by identifying efficient emotion identification techniques.

Method: Used 22,698 social media comments from EmoNoBa dataset, employed TF-IDF vectorizer, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and models like Linear SVM, KNN, Random Forest, BiLSTM, and AdaBoost. LIME was used for explainability.

Result: Evaluated various techniques for emotion identification in Bangla, focusing on efficiency and explainability.

Conclusion: The study contributes to emotion analysis in resource-limited languages, highlighting effective methods for Bangla.

Abstract: Research on understanding emotions in written language continues to expand,
especially for understudied languages with distinctive regional expressions and
cultural features, such as Bangla. This study examines emotion analysis using
22,698 social media comments from the EmoNoBa dataset. For language analysis,
we employ machine learning models: Linear SVM, KNN, and Random Forest with
n-gram data from a TF-IDF vectorizer. We additionally investigated how PCA
affects the reduction of dimensionality. Moreover, we utilized a BiLSTM model
and AdaBoost to improve decision trees. To make our machine learning models
easier to understand, we used LIME to explain the predictions of the AdaBoost
classifier, which uses decision trees. With the goal of advancing sentiment
analysis in languages with limited resources, our work examines various
techniques to find efficient techniques for emotion identification in Bangla.

### [10] [Measuring Corporate Human Capital Disclosures: Lexicon, Data, Code, and Research Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10155)
*Elizabeth Demers,Victor Xiaoqi Wang,Kean Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper develops a machine learning-based lexicon for measuring human capital (HC) disclosures, classifying HC-related keywords into five subcategories, and provides tools for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human capital is vital for corporate value but lacks standardized measurement or disclosure rules, prompting the need for a systematic approach to analyze HC disclosures.

Method: A machine learning algorithm (word2vec) is trained on confirmed HC disclosures to create a lexicon of HC-related keywords, classified into five subcategories. The lexicon, disclosures, and Python code are shared for research use.

Result: A comprehensive HC lexicon is developed, enabling researchers to analyze corporate communications for HC-related insights. The paper also demonstrates applications, such as fine-tuning a BERT model.

Conclusion: The study provides a valuable tool for HC research and highlights future opportunities in HC management and disclosure.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation.
Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined
measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec)
trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of
HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety;
labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and
other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our
lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the
lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including
for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the
code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate
communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of
future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

### [11] [Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10161)
*Yi Wang,Max Kreminski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper evaluates LLMs' story generation by applying them to narrative planning, using benchmarks for causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. GPT-4 tier LLMs perform well on small-scale causal stories but struggle with intentionality and conflict, requiring reinforcement learning for complex reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLMs' story generation capabilities better, addressing limitations in automatic evaluation and manual assessment subjectivity.

Method: Uses narrative planning benchmarks based on literature examples to evaluate LLMs on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict.

Result: GPT-4 tier LLMs generate causally sound small-scale stories but struggle with intentionality and conflict, needing reinforcement learning for complex tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs can produce quality stories at small scales but face challenges with complex narrative elements, highlighting considerations for game environments.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories
remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high
cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers
valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in
the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to
deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them
to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating
LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal
soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments
show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales,
but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains
challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex
reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can
generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also
highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges
and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

*Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Francis Ferraro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Q2E improves video retrieval by decomposing queries using LLMs and VLMs, outperforming baselines with multimodal fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing identification and retrieval of videos related to complex events by leveraging latent knowledge in LLMs and VLMs.

Method: Q2E decomposes queries using embedded knowledge in LLMs and VLMs, employs entropy-based fusion for multimodal inputs, and integrates audio.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on diverse datasets, with audio integration boosting performance.

Conclusion: Q2E effectively leverages multimodal knowledge for zero-shot retrieval, with released code and data for further research.

Abstract: Recent approaches have shown impressive proficiency in extracting and
leveraging parametric knowledge from Large-Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we consider how we can improve the
identification and retrieval of videos related to complex real-world events by
automatically extracting latent parametric knowledge about those events. We
present Q2E: a Query-to-Event decomposition method for zero-shot multilingual
text-to-video retrieval, adaptable across datasets, domains, LLMs, or VLMs. Our
approach demonstrates that we can enhance the understanding of otherwise overly
simplified human queries by decomposing the query using the knowledge embedded
in LLMs and VLMs. We additionally show how to apply our approach to both visual
and speech-based inputs. To combine this varied multimodal knowledge, we adopt
entropy-based fusion scoring for zero-shot fusion. Through evaluations on two
diverse datasets and multiple retrieval metrics, we demonstrate that Q2E
outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines. Our evaluation also shows that
integrating audio information can significantly improve text-to-video
retrieval. We have released code and data for future research.

### [13] [TTT-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Reasoning Ability with Simple and Novel Tic-Tac-Toe-style Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10209)
*Prakamya Mishra,Jiang Liu,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TTT-Bench evaluates LRMs' strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning through simple Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, revealing their struggles despite excelling in complex math tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore LRMs' reasoning abilities beyond STEM, focusing on basic strategic and spatial reasoning tasks that humans solve effortlessly.

Method: Introduces TTT-Bench, a benchmark with four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games, using a programmatic approach to generate verifiable problems.

Result: LRMs, even those excelling in hard math, frequently fail at these simple games, scoring significantly lower compared to math benchmarks.

Conclusion: LRMs struggle with long-term strategic reasoning in simple tasks, highlighting a gap in their reasoning capabilities beyond STEM.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level
mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning
abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the
ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark
that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning
abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games
that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet
scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game
problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they
require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game
board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of
state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard
math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing
reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\%
\& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024
respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter
reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic
reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

*Anneliese Brei,Katharine Henry,Abhisheik Sharma,Shashank Srivastava,Snigdha Chaturvedi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes computational methods to identify unreliable narrators using a human-annotated dataset (TUNa) and evaluates LLMs for classification tasks. Results show the task is challenging but promising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of identifying unreliable narrators in texts using computational methods, bridging literary theory and real-world applications.

Method: Uses TUNa dataset (blog posts, subreddit posts, etc.), defines classification tasks for unreliability types, and tests LLMs with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning.

Result: Task is challenging, but LLMs show potential for identifying unreliable narrators. Dataset and code are released for future research.

Conclusion: The study highlights the feasibility of using LLMs for unreliable narrator classification and encourages further research in this area.

Abstract: Often when we interact with a first-person account of events, we consider
whether or not the narrator, the primary speaker of the text, is reliable. In
this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable
narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information. Borrowing
literary theory from narratology to define different types of unreliable
narrators based on a variety of textual phenomena, we present TUNa, a
human-annotated dataset of narratives from multiple domains, including blog
posts, subreddit posts, hotel reviews, and works of literature. We define
classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and
inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular
open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature
to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this
end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning
settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is
potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators. We release our
expert-annotated dataset and code and invite future research in this area.

*Iago Alves Brito,Julia Soares Dollis,Fernanda Bufon Färber,Diogo Fernandes Costa Silva,Arlindo Rodrigues Galvão Filho*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToxSyn-PT is a large-scale Portuguese corpus for fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine minority groups, created via a novel four-stage synthetic pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of diverse, balanced, and domain-free hate-speech datasets for Portuguese, enabling robust research in low-resource settings.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: (1) manual seed curation, (2) few-shot expansion with an LLM, (3) paraphrase augmentation, and (4) enrichment with neutral texts.

Result: Class-balanced, stylistically diverse corpus yielding strong classification results across five Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: ToxSyn-PT advances synthetic data research and hate-speech detection in Portuguese, with public release for broader use.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables
fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority
groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed
between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a
novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot
expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and
(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to
group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically
diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing
Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,
experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields
strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,
demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset
is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech
detection in low-resource settings.

*Andrea Yaoyun Cui,Pengfei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper challenges the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, showing they can act deterministically under certain conditions, and proposes a method to avoid inferring misleading priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether language models possess Bayesian brains and how their decision-making patterns (stochastic vs. deterministic) affect prior inference methods.

Method: Revisits the sampling assumption, tests language models under various conditions, and proposes a method to distinguish stochastic and deterministic patterns in Gibbs sampling.

Result: Language models can exhibit near-deterministic behavior, challenging prior methods for eliciting human-like priors and revealing potential false priors.

Conclusion: The study highlights the need for careful scrutiny of decision patterns in language models to avoid misleading prior inferences and provides insights into their decision-making.

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token
sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing
and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling
introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make
probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions.
Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling,
inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of
language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language
models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain
conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making,
such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling
temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous
methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing
simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we
propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and
deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the
inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of
large language models to identify their decision patterns under various
circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision
making of large language models.

*Zige Wang,Qi Zhu,Fei Mi,Minghui Xu,Ruochun Jin,Wenjing Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes ClusterUCB, an efficient gradient-based data selection framework using clustering and a modified UCB algorithm to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gradient-based data influence approximation is resource-intensive; an efficient alternative is needed for practical use.

Method: Clusters training data by gradient features, frames selection as a multi-armed bandit problem, and uses a modified UCB algorithm with cold start for exploration-exploitation balance.

Result: ClusterUCB achieves comparable performance to gradient-based methods with significantly lower computational costs.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical solution for efficient data selection in fine-tuning large language models.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select
useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models.
However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process
requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we
propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering
and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition
that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences,
we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the
inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation
problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm
is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling
process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate
the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance
exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show
that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the
original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing
consumption.

### [18] [Flick: Few Labels Text Classification using K-Aware Intermediate Learning in Multi-Task Low-Resource Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10292)
*Ali Almutairi,Abdullah Alsuhaibani,Shoaib Jameel,Usman Naseem,Gelareh Mohammadi,Imran Razzak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Flick is a novel method for few-label text classification in low-resource languages, improving pseudo-label quality by refining high-confidence labels from broad clusters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges of noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation in low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods struggle.

Method: Flick introduces a pseudo-label refinement component, focusing on single-cluster cohesion and adaptive top-k selection to distill reliable pseudo-labels.

Result: Demonstrated superior performance across 14 diverse datasets, including low-resource languages like Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana.

Conclusion: Flick effectively mitigates error propagation in low-resource settings, enabling robust fine-tuning with minimal true labels.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained
significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on
extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in
semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo
labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification
problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or
involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the
persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource
linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy
pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods
that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading
architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling
high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can
dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically
diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label
refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies
by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This
component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an
initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an
adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial
for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data,
allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a
handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse
datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu,
and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and
adaptability.

*Chuck Arvin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs' response quality in education varies with query framing, showing sycophantic behavior—boosting accuracy with correct hints but degrading with incorrect ones, especially in smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how user-provided suggestions influence LLMs in educational settings, focusing on sycophancy risks.

Method: Tested five LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 classes) under five conditions, analyzing response quality, answer flips, and token probabilities.

Result: LLMs' correctness varied by 15 percentage points based on hints, with smaller models showing stronger bias (up to 30%).

Conclusion: Sycophantic behavior in LLMs risks educational equity, requiring better understanding and mitigation strategies.

Abstract: This study examines how user-provided suggestions affect Large Language
Models (LLMs) in a simulated educational context, where sycophancy poses
significant risks. Testing five different LLMs from the OpenAI GPT-4o and
GPT-4.1 model classes across five experimental conditions, we show that
response quality varies dramatically based on query framing. In cases where the
student mentions an incorrect answer, the LLM correctness can degrade by as
much as 15 percentage points, while mentioning the correct answer boosts
accuracy by the same margin. Our results also show that this bias is stronger
in smaller models, with an effect of up to 30% for the GPT-4.1-nano model,
versus 8% for the GPT-4o model. Our analysis of how often LLMs "flip" their
answer, and an investigation into token level probabilities, confirm that the
models are generally changing their answers to answer choices mentioned by
students in line with the sycophancy hypothesis. This sycophantic behavior has
important implications for educational equity, as LLMs may accelerate learning
for knowledgeable students while the same tools may reinforce misunderstanding
for less knowledgeable students. Our results highlight the need to better
understand the mechanism, and ways to mitigate, such bias in the educational
context.

*Hayato Futami,Emiru Tsunoo,Yosuke Kashiwagi,Yuki Ito,Hassan Shahmohammadi,Siddhant Arora,Shinji Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes scheduled interleaved speech-text training to adapt LLMs for speech-to-speech translation, improving performance for low-resource languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of adapting text-trained LLMs to speech modality with limited speech-to-speech data.

Method: Uses interleaved speech-text units during training, gradually reducing text ratio to adapt from text to speech. Fine-tunes LLaMA3.2-1B on CVSS dataset.

Result: Consistent improvement in translation performance, especially for languages with limited training data.

Conclusion: Scheduled interleaved training effectively bridges the modality gap, enhancing S2ST performance.

Abstract: Speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has been advanced with large language
models (LLMs), which are fine-tuned on discrete speech units. In such
approaches, modality adaptation from text to speech has been an issue. LLMs are
trained on text-only data, which presents challenges to adapt them to speech
modality with limited speech-to-speech data. To address the training
difficulty, we propose scheduled interleaved speech--text training in this
study. We use interleaved speech--text units instead of speech units during
training, where aligned text tokens are interleaved at the word level. We
gradually decrease the ratio of text as training progresses, to facilitate
progressive modality adaptation from text to speech. We conduct experimental
evaluations by fine-tuning LLaMA3.2-1B for S2ST on the CVSS dataset. We show
that the proposed method consistently improves the translation performances,
especially for languages with limited training data.

TL;DR: A scalable method generates high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for LLMs by leveraging program execution determinism, improving reasoning accuracy and reducing token length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable and accurate reasoning supervision for LLMs is challenging; existing methods rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT.

Method: Extracts verifiable reasoning traces from code execution, transforming them into natural language CoT reasoning.

Result: Enhances LLMs' transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks and reduces token length during inference.

Conclusion: The method effectively produces accurate reasoning data and improves LLM performance.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However,
obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant
challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT
supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike
existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human
annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable,
step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a
natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across
various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable
reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies
validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces
overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and
overthinking.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TableRAG improves RAG for heterogeneous documents by preserving tabular structure and enabling multi-hop reasoning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RAG methods fail with heterogeneous documents (text + tables), disrupting structure and losing information.

Method: TableRAG uses query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL execution, and answer generation in four iterative steps.

Result: TableRAG outperforms baselines on public datasets and the new HeteQA benchmark.

Conclusion: TableRAG sets a new standard for heterogeneous document QA, with code released for public use.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable
effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to
heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components,
existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice
of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular
structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities
of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose
TableRAG, an hybrid framework that unifies textual understanding and complex
manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps:
context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and
execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop
HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous
reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG
consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our
HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question
answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

*Yuhua Jiang,Yuwen Xiong,Yufeng Yuan,Chao Xin,Wenyuan Xu,Yu Yue,Qianchuan Zhao,Lin Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PAG is a framework enabling LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles, improving reasoning and verification without separate models or complex pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with self-verification; existing solutions are unscalable. PAG aims to simplify and enhance self-correction.

Method: PAG uses a multi-turn RL paradigm with selective revision: the model revises only when errors are detected.

Result: PAG improves reasoning and verification, outperforming self-consistency and enhancing accuracy.

Conclusion: PAG offers a scalable, unified solution for LLM self-correction, advancing both reasoning and verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the
correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification
challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage
self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we
propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework
that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier
roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm.
Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless
of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model
revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an
error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but
also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive
experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual
advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction
accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

TL;DR: The paper introduces TempVS, a benchmark for evaluating temporal grounding and reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) using image sequences, revealing performance gaps compared to humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve MLLMs' ability to understand temporal order in events by integrating visual and linguistic modalities.

Method: TempVS includes three tests (event relation inference, sentence ordering, image ordering) with grounding tests, evaluating 38 MLLMs.

Result: MLLMs perform poorly on TempVS, lagging behind human capabilities, but insights suggest future research directions.

Conclusion: TempVS highlights MLLMs' limitations in temporal reasoning and offers a benchmark for advancing such capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces the TempVS benchmark, which focuses on temporal
grounding and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) in image sequences. TempVS consists of three main tests (i.e., event
relation inference, sentence ordering and image ordering), each accompanied
with a basic grounding test. TempVS requires MLLMs to rely on both visual and
linguistic modalities to understand the temporal order of events. We evaluate
38 state-of-the-art MLLMs, demonstrating that models struggle to solve TempVS,
with a substantial performance gap compared to human capabilities. We also
provide fine-grained insights that suggest promising directions for future
research. Our TempVS benchmark data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper analyzes media framing in the Israel-Palestine conflict using computational methods, revealing a bias toward war journalism and regional differences in reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address gaps in qualitative studies and surface-level framing analyses by using computational tools to explore deeper framing indicators in conflict reporting.

Method: Combines frame semantics and large language models to analyze communicative and linguistic framing in news articles from US, UK, and Middle Eastern outlets.

Result: Finds a predominance of war-focused reporting and regional biases in framing assailants and victims.

Conclusion: Highlights media biases and the need for deeper, computational approaches to understand conflict framing.

Abstract: Framing used by news media, especially in times of conflict, can have
substantial impact on readers' opinion, potentially aggravating the conflict
itself. Current studies on the topic of conflict framing have limited insights
due to their qualitative nature or only look at surface level generic frames
without going deeper. In this work, we identify indicators of war and peace
journalism, as outlined by prior work in conflict studies, in a corpus of news
articles reporting on the Israel-Palestine war. For our analysis, we use
computational approaches, using a combination of frame semantics and large
language models to identify both communicative framing and its connection to
linguistic framing. Our analysis reveals a higher focus on war based reporting
rather than peace based. We also show substantial differences in reporting
across the US, UK, and Middle Eastern news outlets in framing who the assailant
and victims of the conflict are, surfacing biases within the media.

### [26] [Fast on the Easy, Deep on the Hard: Efficient Reasoning via Powered Length Penalty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10446)
*Zehui Ling,Deshu Chen,Hongwei Zhang,Yifeng Jiao,Xin Guo,Yuan Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve LLM reasoning efficiency by balancing conciseness and accuracy, using a tailored reward function with output-length penalties. It shows success in benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM reasoning methods often produce unnecessarily long outputs, increasing latency. Uniform penalties for length ignore problem complexity, leading to inefficiency.

Method: The approach divides the reward function and introduces a novel penalty for output length, promoting conciseness for simpler problems while ensuring sufficient reasoning for complex ones.

Result: The method reduces output lengths for simpler datasets (GSM8K, MATH500) without sacrificing accuracy and improves accuracy for the more complex AIME2024 dataset.

Conclusion: Tailoring reasoning efficiency by problem complexity enhances LLM performance, balancing conciseness and accuracy effectively.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
reasoning capabilities, performing well on various challenging benchmarks.
Techniques like Chain-of-Thought prompting have been introduced to further
improve reasoning. However, these approaches frequently generate longer
outputs, which in turn increase computational latency. Although some methods
use reinforcement learning to shorten reasoning, they often apply uniform
penalties without considering the problem's complexity, leading to suboptimal
outcomes. In this study, we seek to enhance the efficiency of LLM reasoning by
promoting conciseness for simpler problems while preserving sufficient
reasoning for more complex ones for accuracy, thus improving the model's
overall performance. Specifically, we manage the model's reasoning efficiency
by dividing the reward function and including a novel penalty for output
length. Our approach has yielded impressive outcomes in benchmark evaluations
across three datasets: GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2024. For the comparatively
simpler datasets GSM8K and MATH500, our method has effectively shortened output
lengths while preserving or enhancing accuracy. On the more demanding AIME2024
dataset, our approach has resulted in improved accuracy.

*Xanh Ho,Sunisth Kumar,Yun-Ang Wu,Florian Boudin,Atsuhiro Takasu,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper reframes table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to identify key table cells for claim verification, and introduces a dataset with human-annotated rationales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting claim labels alone lacks interpretability; understanding model reasoning requires identifying essential table cells.

Method: Extends SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level rationales, proposes a taxonomy for ambiguous cases, and tests LLMs.

Result: Incorporating table alignment improves claim verification, but LLMs often fail to align with human rationales.

Conclusion: Models need better alignment with human reasoning for faithful claim verification.

Abstract: Scientific claim verification against tables typically requires predicting
whether a claim is supported or refuted given a table. However, we argue that
predicting the final label alone is insufficient: it reveals little about the
model's reasoning and offers limited interpretability. To address this, we
reframe table-text alignment as an explanation task, requiring models to
identify the table cells essential for claim verification. We build a new
dataset by extending the SciTab benchmark with human-annotated cell-level
rationales. Annotators verify the claim label and highlight the minimal set of
cells needed to support their decision. After the annotation process, we
utilize the collected information and propose a taxonomy for handling ambiguous
cases. Our experiments show that (i) incorporating table alignment information
improves claim verification performance, and (ii) most LLMs, while often
predicting correct labels, fail to recover human-aligned rationales, suggesting
that their predictions do not stem from faithful reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines bias in large language models (LLMs) using proxy measures, finding negligible bias in pre-prompted personae but significant bias in grading user answers and salary negotiation advice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how biases in training data manifest in LLMs, especially with trends like memory and personalization.

Method: Evaluated bias using pre-prompted personae on MMLU, reformulated tasks (grading user answers), and salary negotiation advice.

Result: Negligible bias in pre-prompted personae, significant bias in grading and salary advice.

Conclusion: Bias in LLMs is context-dependent, and personalization trends may exacerbate it.

Abstract: Modern language models are trained on large amounts of data. These data
inevitably include controversial and stereotypical content, which contains all
sorts of biases related to gender, origin, age, etc. As a result, the models
express biased points of view or produce different results based on the
assigned personality or the personality of the user. In this paper, we
investigate various proxy measures of bias in large language models (LLMs). We
find that evaluating models with pre-prompted personae on a multi-subject
benchmark (MMLU) leads to negligible and mostly random differences in scores.
However, if we reformulate the task and ask a model to grade the user's answer,
this shows more significant signs of bias. Finally, if we ask the model for
salary negotiation advice, we see pronounced bias in the answers. With the
recent trend for LLM assistant memory and personalization, these problems open
up from a different angle: modern LLM users do not need to pre-prompt the
description of their persona since the model already knows their
socio-demographics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DST benchmarks focus on structured single-user conversations, missing the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions. The study aims to evaluate LLM robustness in multi-user DST while minimizing dataset costs.

Method: The study extends an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user using speech act theory, systematically incorporating multi-user interactions for controlled evaluation.

Result: Experiments show a significant performance drop in LLMs for multi-user DST compared to single-user settings, exposing limitations in tracking dialogue states with multiple speakers.

Conclusion: The findings stress the need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST, aiming for more realistic and robust models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific
training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured
user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world
multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in
multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent
advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by
generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our
methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into
conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings.
Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to
single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and
tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the
need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving
the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes the RRP framework to enhance LLMs by integrating knowledge graphs, focusing on refining reasoning paths for better performance in complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to lack of background knowledge and hallucinations. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs fail to address complex questions effectively.

Method: The RRP framework mines KGs using LLMs' semantic strengths, relation embedding, and bidirectional distribution learning, with a rethinking module to refine reasoning paths.

Result: RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets and can be integrated into various LLMs in a plug-and-play manner.

Conclusion: RRP effectively enhances LLM reasoning by generating high-quality, tailored reasoning paths.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks
due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address
these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been
intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual
knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that
refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically
consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself.
Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the
following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of
multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and
redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to
mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with
structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional
distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that
evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance.
Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover,
RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning
abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths
tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: An unsupervised hybrid method combining data-driven inference and rule-based heuristics for reconstructing protoforms, outperforming baselines in accuracy and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods rely heavily on data-driven probabilistic models, limiting their effectiveness. The goal is to improve protoform reconstruction by integrating linguistic constraints.

Method: A hybrid approach using evolutionary optimization to combine statistical patterns and linguistically motivated rules for protoform reconstruction.

Result: Substantial improvements over baselines in reconstructing Latin protoforms, measured by character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility.

Conclusion: The hybrid method effectively enhances protoform reconstruction by balancing data-driven and rule-based insights.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method for the reconstruction of protoforms i.e.,
ancestral word forms from which modern language forms are derived. While prior
work has primarily relied on probabilistic models of phonological edits to
infer protoforms from cognate sets, such approaches are limited by their
predominantly data-driven nature. In contrast, our model integrates data-driven
inference with rule-based heuristics within an evolutionary optimization
framework. This hybrid approach leverages on both statistical patterns and
linguistically motivated constraints to guide the reconstruction process. We
evaluate our method on the task of reconstructing Latin protoforms using a
dataset of cognates from five Romance languages. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over established baselines across both
character-level accuracy and phonological plausibility metrics.

Result: The retrieval-augmented LLM system outperformed baselines, showing effectiveness in pedagogical feedback.

Conclusion: Combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning is effective for mistake identification in AI tutors.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA
2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The
task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a
mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1)
an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from
multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer
using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with
multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and
(4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model
(LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples,
constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce
interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the
effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for
pedagogical feedback assessment. Our code is available at

### [34] [Spelling-out is not Straightforward: LLMs' Capability of Tokenization from Token to Characters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10641)
*Tatsuya Hiraoka,Kentaro Inui*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs struggle with complex character-level tasks despite high spelling accuracy, relying on higher Transformer layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level information during spelling.

Method: Analyzed LLMs' spelling behavior using probing classifiers, knowledge neurons, and attention weights.

Result: Embedding layers inadequately encode character-level info; higher layers reconstruct it, showing a 'breakthrough' in spelling behavior.

Conclusion: LLMs handle character-level tasks non-intuitively, relying on deeper layers for accurate spelling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can spell out tokens character by character with
high accuracy, yet they struggle with more complex character-level tasks, such
as identifying compositional subcomponents within tokens. In this work, we
investigate how LLMs internally represent and utilize character-level
information during the spelling-out process. Our analysis reveals that,
although spelling out is a simple task for humans, it is not handled in a
straightforward manner by LLMs. Specifically, we show that the embedding layer
does not fully encode character-level information, particularly beyond the
first character. As a result, LLMs rely on intermediate and higher Transformer
layers to reconstruct character-level knowledge, where we observe a distinct
"breakthrough" in their spelling behavior. We validate this mechanism through
three complementary analyses: probing classifiers, identification of knowledge
neurons, and inspection of attention weights.

*Thanh Thi Nguyen,Campbell Wilson,Janis Dalins*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents a method using large language models (LLMs) to detect life-threatening language, outperforming traditional techniques like bag of words and BERT. Fine-tuned LLMs (Mistral, Llama-2, Gemma) show strong performance, especially in imbalanced data scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve detection of life-threatening language for mental health and harm prevention, comparing LLMs with traditional methods.

Method: Fine-tuning open-source LLMs (Gemma, Mistral, Llama-2) on balanced and imbalanced datasets, comparing them to traditional techniques.

Result: LLMs, especially Mistral and Llama-2, outperform traditional methods. Upsampling helps traditional methods but has less impact on LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs show great potential for real-world life-threatening language detection, with Mistral and Llama-2 leading in performance.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals
in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential
harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying
life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them
with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling,
and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three
open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter
variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance,
imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a
strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically,
Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced
data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling
technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while
this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on
LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world
life-threatening language detection problems.

TL;DR: The paper addresses missing hypernymy links for adjectives in the Open English Wordnet, proposing a method to predict and establish these links using fine-tuned language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance the Open English Wordnet by filling gaps in hypernymy relations for adjectives, which are less explored compared to nouns and verbs.

Method: Theoretical analysis of adjective hypernymy, development of a new resource, and fine-tuning large language models (e.g., TaxoLLaMa) for prediction.

Result: Successful adaptation of TaxoLLaMa to predict adjective hypernymy, contributing a new resource for this purpose.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses the gap in adjective hypernymy relations, demonstrating the adaptability of existing methodologies to new linguistic tasks.

Abstract: Open English Wordnet is a key resource published in OntoLex-lemon as part of
the linguistic linked open data cloud. There are, however, many links missing
in the resource, and in this paper, we look at how we can establish hypernymy
between adjectives. We present a theoretical discussion of the hypernymy
relation and how it differs for adjectives in contrast to nouns and verbs. We
develop a new resource for adjective hypernymy and fine-tune large language
models to predict adjective hypernymy, showing that the methodology of
TaxoLLaMa can be adapted to this task.

### [37] [PREMISE: Scalable and Strategic Prompt Optimization for Efficient Mathematical Reasoning in Large Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10716)
*Ye Yu,Yaoning Yu,Haohan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PREMISE reduces token usage and cost in large reasoning models (LRMs) by optimizing prompts for brevity and correctness, maintaining accuracy while cutting costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verbose reasoning traces in LRMs inflate token usage and cost, limiting deployment in constrained settings.

Method: PREMISE uses trace-level diagnostics and gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundancy without modifying model weights.

Result: Achieves same or better accuracy (e.g., 96% with Claude) while reducing tokens by up to 87.5% and costs by 69-82%.

Conclusion: Prompt-level optimization is a scalable way to improve LRM efficiency without sacrificing reasoning quality.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve
strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This
inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient
Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that
reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines
trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize
redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly
optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that
balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a
single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial
LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy
($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while
reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by
$69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical
and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning
quality.

### [38] [Beyond True or False: Retrieval-Augmented Hierarchical Analysis of Nuanced Claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10728)
*Priyanka Kargupta,Runchu Tian,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ClaimSpect is a framework for breaking down nuanced claims into hierarchical aspects and sub-aspects, enriching them with corpus-specific perspectives for a structured response.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Nuanced claims (e.g., scientific or political) are hard to label as simply true/false. Breaking them into smaller, validated aspects provides a comprehensive perspective.

Method: ClaimSpect uses retrieval-augmented generation to construct a hierarchy of aspects, retrieve relevant corpus segments, and discover perspectives (support, neutral, oppose).

Result: Applied to scientific and political claims, ClaimSpect effectively deconstructs claims and represents corpus perspectives, outperforming baselines in robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: ClaimSpect offers a structured, scalable approach to analyzing nuanced claims, validated through real-world case studies and human evaluation.

Abstract: Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be
clearly labeled as entirely "true" or "false" -- as is frequently the case with
scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., "vaccine A is better
than vaccine B") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects
(e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to
validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides
a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to
prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards
children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based
framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically
considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific
perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to
retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects.
Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards
an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective
prevalence (e.g., "how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more
transportable than B?"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world
scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing
its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing
perspectives within a corpus. Through real-world case studies and human
evaluation, we validate its effectiveness over multiple baselines.

*Priyanka Kargupta,Nan Zhang,Yunyi Zhang,Rui Zhang,Prasenjit Mitra,Jiawei Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TaxoAdapt is a framework for dynamically adapting LLM-generated taxonomies to scientific corpora, addressing gaps in generalizability and multidimensionality, outperforming baselines in granularity and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in organizing scientific literature due to evolving fields, limitations of expert-curated and automatic taxonomy methods, and the need for multidimensional adaptability.

Method: TaxoAdapt uses iterative hierarchical classification to expand taxonomy width and depth based on corpus topical distribution.

Result: Outperforms baselines with 26.51% better granularity-preservation and 50.41% higher coherence.

Conclusion: TaxoAdapt effectively structures and captures the evolution of scientific fields, offering a scalable and adaptable solution.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing
and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have
traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive.
Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1)
over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend
heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained
within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of
evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for
the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research
paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks,
evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a
framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus
across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical
classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus'
topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a
diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its
ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a
multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more
granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive
baselines judged by LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Using a universal tokenizer improves language adaptation in multilingual LLMs, achieving up to 20.2% higher win rates and better plasticity for unseen languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing challenges in multilingual LLM pretraining, such as limited model capacity, scarce data, and tokenizer gaps for new languages.

Method: Proposing a universal tokenizer trained for more languages than the primary pretraining set to enhance post-training adaptation.

Result: Universal tokenizer boosts language adaptation by up to 20.2% and improves plasticity for unseen languages by 5%, with minimal performance loss on pretraining languages.

Conclusion: A universal tokenizer is a cost-effective intervention for improving language plasticity in multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Pretraining massively multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) for many
languages at once is challenging due to limited model capacity, scarce
high-quality data, and compute constraints. Moreover, the lack of language
coverage of the tokenizer makes it harder to address the gap for new languages
purely at the post-training stage. In this work, we study what relatively cheap
interventions early on in training improve "language plasticity", or adaptation
capabilities of the model post-training to new languages. We focus on tokenizer
design and propose using a universal tokenizer that is trained for more
languages than the primary pretraining languages to enable efficient adaptation
in expanding language coverage after pretraining. Our systematic experiments
across diverse groups of languages and different training strategies show that
a universal tokenizer enables significantly higher language adaptation, with up
to 20.2% increase in win rates compared to tokenizers specific to pretraining
languages. Furthermore, a universal tokenizer also leads to better plasticity
towards languages that are completely unseen in the tokenizer and pretraining,
by up to 5% win rate gain. We achieve this adaptation to an expanded set of
languages with minimal compromise in performance on the majority of languages
included in pretraining.

TL;DR: The paper evaluates uncertainty estimation methods for LLMs in clinical multiple-choice QA, comparing single-generation and sampling-based approaches. Lightweight methods using behavioral signals perform nearly as well as Semantic Entropy with one generation. Results highlight variability across specialties and question types, emphasizing model selection based on context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying LLMs in high-stakes clinical decision support.

Method: Fine-grained evaluation of ten open-source LLMs across two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types, comparing single-generation and sampling-based methods. A case study explores lightweight estimators using behavioral signals.

Result: Lightweight methods approach Semantic Entropy performance with one generation. Significant variation across specialties and question types is observed.

Conclusion: Model selection should consider question nature and model-specific strengths, as performance varies widely across contexts.

Abstract: Accurate and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates are essential for
deploying large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains such as clinical
decision support. We present a fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
estimation methods for clinical multiple-choice question answering, covering
ten open-source LLMs (general-purpose, biomedical, and reasoning models) across
two datasets, eleven medical specialties, and six question types. We compare
standard single-generation and sampling-based methods, and present a case study
exploring simple, single-pass estimators based on behavioral signals in
reasoning traces. These lightweight methods approach the performance of
Semantic Entropy while requiring only one generation. Our results reveal
substantial variation across specialties and question types, underscoring the
importance of selecting models based on both the nature of the question and
model-specific strengths.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A method using LLM revision improves ASR accuracy for named entities, reducing WER by 30% on a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Named entities are critical but often misrecognized in ASR, impacting downstream tasks.

Method: Leverages LLM reasoning and local context to revise ASR predictions for named entities.

Result: Achieves 30% relative WER reduction for named entities on the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset.

Conclusion: LLM-based revision effectively improves ASR performance for named entities.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised
training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved
remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of
state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are
often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream
applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a
complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM)
revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by
leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture
notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the
NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses
for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves
up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

*Wei Sun,Tingyu Qu,Mingxiao Li,Jesse Davis,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LangEdit is a framework for updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs without interference, using null-space constraints to isolate language-specific updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of updating multilingual knowledge in LLMs efficiently while avoiding destructive interference across languages.

Method: LangEdit projects parameter updates for each language onto orthogonal subspaces to ensure independence and preserve generalization.

Result: LangEdit outperforms existing methods, mitigating interference and improving accuracy across languages and tasks.

Conclusion: LangEdit enables efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge updates in LLMs.

Abstract: Efficiently updating multilingual knowledge in large language models (LLMs),
while preserving consistent factual representations across languages, remains a
long-standing and unresolved challenge. While deploying separate editing
systems for each language might seem viable, this approach incurs substantial
costs due to the need to manage multiple models. A more efficient solution
involves integrating knowledge updates across all languages into a unified
model. However, performing sequential edits across languages often leads to
destructive parameter interference, significantly degrading multilingual
generalization and the accuracy of injected knowledge. To address this
challenge, we propose LangEdit, a novel null-space constrained framework
designed to precisely isolate language-specific knowledge updates. The core
innovation of LangEdit lies in its ability to project parameter updates for
each language onto the orthogonal complement of previous updated subspaces.
This approach mathematically guarantees update independence while preserving
multilingual generalization capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation
across three model architectures, six languages, and four downstream tasks,
demonstrating that LangEdit effectively mitigates parameter interference and
outperforms existing state-of-the-art editing methods. Our results highlight
its potential for enabling efficient and accurate multilingual knowledge
updates in LLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: ReCUT improves LLM reasoning by reducing redundant steps while maintaining accuracy, using stepwise exploration and dual-model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overthinking and redundancy in Chain-of-Thought prompting, which hampers efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Stepwise exploration, long-short sampling, and training two specialized models (accuracy-focused and brevity-focused), then interpolating their parameters.

Result: Reduces reasoning length by 30-50% without sacrificing accuracy, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: ReCUT effectively balances reasoning accuracy and efficiency, offering a practical solution for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
improved the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
these methods often suffer from overthinking, leading to unnecessarily lengthy
or redundant reasoning traces. Existing approaches attempt to mitigate this
issue through curating multiple reasoning chains for training LLMs, but their
effectiveness is often constrained by the quality of the generated data and
prone to overfitting. To address the challenge, we propose Reasoning
Compression ThroUgh Stepwise Trials (ReCUT), a novel method aimed at balancing
the accuracy and length of reasoning trajectory. Specifically, ReCUT employs a
stepwise exploration mechanism and a long-short switched sampling strategy,
enabling LLMs to incrementally generate diverse reasoning paths. These paths
are evaluated and used to construct preference pairs to train two specialized
models (Gemini LLMs)-one optimized for reasoning accuracy, the other for
shorter reasoning. A final integrated model is obtained by interpolating the
parameters of these two models. Experimental results across multiple math
reasoning datasets and backbone models demonstrate that ReCUT significantly
reduces reasoning lengths by approximately 30-50%, while maintaining or
improving reasoning accuracy compared to various baselines. All codes and data
will be released via https://github.com/NEUIR/ReCUT.

TL;DR: SlowFast Sampling is a dynamic strategy for diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) that alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling strategies for dLLMs suffer from static behavior, leading to inefficiency and inflexibility.

Method: Proposes SlowFast Sampling, guided by certainty, convergence, and positional principles, and integrates with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundancy.

Result: Achieves up to 15.63× speedup on LLaDA and 34.22× with caching, outperforming autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B.

Conclusion: Well-designed sampling can unlock dLLMs' potential for fast, high-quality generation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token
generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing
sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive
decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency
and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel
dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and
accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles:
certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which
govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We
further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling
achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and
up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach
outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput,
demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of
dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

TL;DR: The paper analyzes how wav2vec2 models trained on four languages encode speech features like phones, tones, and speaker info, showing their representations are largely language-independent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how self-supervised speech models like wav2vec2 represent speech features across different languages, beyond just English.

Method: Probing classifiers and geometric analyses were used to examine phone, tone, and speaker representations in wav2vec2 models trained on four languages.

Result: Representations for phones, tones, and speakers are largely orthogonal across languages, with minor advantages for matched-language probes in later layers.

Conclusion: The structure of wav2vec2's representations is largely independent of the pretraining language, suggesting universal encoding patterns.

Abstract: Analyses of self-supervised speech models have begun to reveal where and how
they represent different types of information. However, almost all analyses
have focused on English. Here, we examine how wav2vec2 models trained on four
different languages encode both language-matched and non-matched speech. We use
probing classifiers and geometric analyses to examine how phones, lexical
tones, and speaker information are represented. We show that for all
pretraining and test languages, the subspaces encoding phones, tones, and
speakers are largely orthogonal, and that layerwise patterns of probing
accuracy are similar, with a relatively small advantage for matched-language
phone and tone (but not speaker) probes in the later layers. Our findings
suggest that the structure of representations learned by wav2vec2 is largely
independent of the speech material used during pretraining.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing medical dialogue systems struggle with identifying relevant knowledge and generating personalized, accurate responses.

Method: MedRef uses a knowledge refining mechanism and dynamic prompt adjustment, including Triplet Filter and Demo Selector modules, to enhance response quality.

Result: MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generation quality and medical entity accuracy on MedDG and KaMed benchmarks.

Conclusion: MedRef is effective and reliable for real-world healthcare applications, addressing key challenges in medical dialogue systems.

Abstract: Medical dialogue systems (MDS) have emerged as crucial online platforms for
enabling multi-turn, context-aware conversations with patients. However,
existing MDS often struggle to (1) identify relevant medical knowledge and (2)
generate personalized, medically accurate responses. To address these
challenges, we propose MedRef, a novel MDS that incorporates knowledge refining
and dynamic prompt adjustment. First, we employ a knowledge refining mechanism
to filter out irrelevant medical data, improving predictions of critical
medical entities in responses. Additionally, we design a comprehensive prompt
structure that incorporates historical details and evident details. To enable
real-time adaptability to diverse patient conditions, we implement two key
modules, Triplet Filter and Demo Selector, providing appropriate knowledge and
demonstrations equipped in the system prompt. Extensive experiments on MedDG
and KaMed benchmarks show that MedRef outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
both generation quality and medical entity accuracy, underscoring its
effectiveness and reliability for real-world healthcare applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper explores the dual behavior of LLMs in knowledge acquisition, attributing generalization and hallucination to out-of-context reasoning (OCR). It formalizes OCR theoretically and empirically, highlighting the role of matrix factorization and gradient descent's implicit bias.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why LLMs exhibit both generalization and hallucination during knowledge acquisition, despite fine-tuning.

Method: The study formalizes OCR as a synthetic factual recall task, tests it across five LLMs, and analyzes a simplified transformer model to isolate the role of matrix factorization.

Result: OCR drives both behaviors, with matrix factorization being crucial. Gradient descent's implicit bias explains the model's efficiency in associating facts, causal or spurious.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical foundation for OCR, aiding in analyzing and mitigating undesirable LLM behaviors from knowledge injection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can acquire new knowledge through fine-tuning,
but this process exhibits a puzzling duality: models can generalize remarkably
from new facts, yet are also prone to hallucinating incorrect information.
However, the reasons for this phenomenon remain poorly understood. In this
work, we argue that both behaviors stem from a single mechanism known as
out-of-context reasoning (OCR): the ability to deduce implications by
associating concepts, even those without a causal link. Our experiments across
five prominent LLMs confirm that OCR indeed drives both generalization and
hallucination, depending on whether the associated concepts are causally
related. To build a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon, we
then formalize OCR as a synthetic factual recall task. We empirically show that
a one-layer single-head attention-only transformer with factorized output and
value matrices can learn to solve this task, while a model with combined
weights cannot, highlighting the crucial role of matrix factorization. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the OCR capability can be attributed to the
implicit bias of gradient descent, which favors solutions that minimize the
nuclear norm of the combined output-value matrix. This mathematical structure
explains why the model learns to associate facts and implications with high
sample efficiency, regardless of whether the correlation is causal or merely
spurious. Ultimately, our work provides a theoretical foundation for
understanding the OCR phenomenon, offering a new lens for analyzing and
mitigating undesirable behaviors from knowledge injection.

*Thomas Sounack,Joshua Davis,Brigitte Durieux,Antoine Chaffin,Tom J. Pollard,Eric Lehman,Alistair E. W. Johnson,Matthew McDermott,Tristan Naumann,Charlotta Lindvall*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BioClinical ModernBERT is a domain-adapted encoder for biomedical and clinical NLP, improving speed and performance over existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder models lag in development compared to decoders, limiting domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical NLP.

Method: Continued pretraining on a large biomedical/clinical corpus (53.5B tokens) and diverse datasets (20 sources).

Result: Outperforms existing encoders on four downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BioClinical ModernBERT advances biomedical NLP with improved performance and broader applicability.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical
Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes
them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from
unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen
slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain
adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical
ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT
release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in
speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT
is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and
clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key
limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse
institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from
a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on
four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base
(150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical
ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

### [52] [Beyond Gold Standards: Epistemic Ensemble of LLM Judges for Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10903)
*Lan Zhang,Marco Valentino,Andre Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces a systematic, automatic method (EFG ensemble of LLM judges) to evaluate autoformalization tasks in formal mathematics, addressing limitations of coarse-grained evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for evaluating autoformalization lack nuance for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, requiring scalable and reliable alternatives to human evaluation.

Method: The proposed EFG ensemble of LLM judges evaluates autoformalization based on logical preservation, mathematical consistency, formal validity, and formal quality.

Result: The EFG ensemble correlates more strongly with human assessments than coarse-grained models, especially for formal qualities.

Conclusion: LLM-as-judges, guided by atomic properties, can provide scalable, interpretable, and reliable evaluation for formal mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Autoformalization plays a crucial role in formal mathematical reasoning by
enabling the automatic translation of natural language statements into formal
languages. While recent advances using large language models (LLMs) have shown
promising results, methods for automatically evaluating autoformalization
remain underexplored. As one moves to more complex domains (e.g., advanced
mathematics), human evaluation requires significant time and domain expertise,
especially as the complexity of the underlying statements and background
knowledge increases. LLM-as-a-judge presents a promising approach for
automating such evaluation. However, existing methods typically employ
coarse-grained and generic evaluation criteria, which limit their effectiveness
for advanced formal mathematical reasoning, where quality hinges on nuanced,
multi-granular dimensions. In this work, we take a step toward addressing this
gap by introducing a systematic, automatic method to evaluate autoformalization
tasks. The proposed method is based on an epistemically and formally grounded
ensemble (EFG) of LLM judges, defined on criteria encompassing logical
preservation (LP), mathematical consistency (MC), formal validity (FV), and
formal quality (FQ), resulting in a transparent assessment that accounts for
different contributing factors. We validate the proposed framework to serve as
a proxy for autoformalization assessment within the domain of formal
mathematics. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that the EFG ensemble of LLM
judges is a suitable emerging proxy for evaluation, more strongly correlating
with human assessments than a coarse-grained model, especially when assessing
formal qualities. These findings suggest that LLM-as-judges, especially when
guided by a well-defined set of atomic properties, could offer a scalable,
interpretable, and reliable support for evaluating formal mathematical
reasoning.

TL;DR: Magistral is Mistral's first reasoning model, trained using a scalable RL pipeline without relying on prior models. It explores pure RL training for LLMs, maintains initial capabilities, and improves multimodal understanding. Magistral Medium and Small are introduced, with the latter open-sourced.


<details>

Motivation: To explore the limits of pure RL training for LLMs and develop a scalable RL pipeline without dependency on prior implementations.

Method: Ground-up approach using proprietary models and infrastructure, focusing on pure RL training and forcing reasoning language.

Result: RL on text maintains or improves multimodal understanding, instruction following, and function calling. Magistral Medium and Small are successfully trained.

Conclusion: Pure RL training is viable for LLMs, and Magistral demonstrates scalability and capability retention, with open-sourcing of Magistral Small.

Abstract: We introduce Magistral, Mistral's first reasoning model and our own scalable
reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline. Instead of relying on existing
implementations and RL traces distilled from prior models, we follow a ground
up approach, relying solely on our own models and infrastructure. Notably, we
demonstrate a stack that enabled us to explore the limits of pure RL training
of LLMs, present a simple method to force the reasoning language of the model,
and show that RL on text data alone maintains most of the initial checkpoint's
capabilities. We find that RL on text maintains or improves multimodal
understanding, instruction following and function calling. We present Magistral
Medium, trained for reasoning on top of Mistral Medium 3 with RL alone, and we
open-source Magistral Small (Apache 2.0) which further includes cold-start data
from Magistral Medium.

### [54] [Decomposing MLP Activations into Interpretable Features via Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10920)
*Or Shafran,Atticus Geiger,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper proposes using semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to decompose MLP activations in LLMs, outperforming sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and supervised methods in interpretability and causal steering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods like SAEs lack intrinsic interpretability and struggle in causal evaluations, motivating a need for better unsupervised techniques to identify interpretable features in LLMs.

Method: The authors use SNMF to decompose MLP activations, ensuring features are sparse linear combinations of neurons and mapped to activating inputs for direct interpretability.

Result: SNMF-derived features outperform SAEs and supervised baselines in causal steering and align with human-interpretable concepts, revealing hierarchical structures in activation space.

Conclusion: SNMF is a simple and effective tool for identifying interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

Abstract: A central goal for mechanistic interpretability has been to identify the
right units of analysis in large language models (LLMs) that causally explain
their outputs. While early work focused on individual neurons, evidence that
neurons often encode multiple concepts has motivated a shift toward analyzing
directions in activation space. A key question is how to find directions that
capture interpretable features in an unsupervised manner. Current methods rely
on dictionary learning with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), commonly trained over
residual stream activations to learn directions from scratch. However, SAEs
often struggle in causal evaluations and lack intrinsic interpretability, as
their learning is not explicitly tied to the computations of the model. Here,
we tackle these limitations by directly decomposing MLP activations with
semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF), such that the learned features
are (a) sparse linear combinations of co-activated neurons, and (b) mapped to
their activating inputs, making them directly interpretable. Experiments on
Llama 3.1, Gemma 2 and GPT-2 show that SNMF derived features outperform SAEs
and a strong supervised baseline (difference-in-means) on causal steering,
while aligning with human-interpretable concepts. Further analysis reveals that
specific neuron combinations are reused across semantically-related features,
exposing a hierarchical structure in the MLP's activation space. Together,
these results position SNMF as a simple and effective tool for identifying
interpretable features and dissecting concept representations in LLMs.

*Timothy Obiso,Kenneth Lai,Abhijnan Nath,Nikhil Krishnaswamy,James Pustejovsky*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'dynamic epistemic friction' as resistance to belief updates in LLMs, framing it within Dynamic Epistemic Logic and demonstrating its predictive power in dialogues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked role of epistemic friction in aligning LLMs with human preferences, particularly in belief updates during interactions.

Method: Defines dynamic epistemic friction, positions it within Dynamic Epistemic Logic, and analyzes its predictive capability in collaborative tasks.

Result: Shows that the model effectively predicts belief updates in dialogues and can be refined for real-world complexities.

Conclusion: Highlights the importance of epistemic friction in belief alignment and suggests further sophistication for practical dialogue scenarios.

Abstract: Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.

*Mozhi Zhang,Howe Tissue,Lu Wang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Domain2Vec decomposes datasets into meta-domains, enabling efficient data mixture optimization for LM pretraining with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve language model pretraining by aligning training and validation data distributions without additional training.

Method: Uses meta-domains and a classifier to decompose datasets into domain vectors, optimizing data mixtures under the DA² assumption.

Result: Achieves same validation loss with 51.5% computation and improves downstream performance by 2.83% under equivalent compute.

Conclusion: Domain2Vec efficiently enhances LM pretraining and downstream task performance with minimal overhead.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any
dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept
designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets.
\textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a
classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds
to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the
identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining
in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution
\textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when
the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better
aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can
be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between
domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and
scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task
performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically,
\textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only
$51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of
The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves
downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

TL;DR: A benchmark for Chinese harmful content detection is introduced, addressing the scarcity of Chinese datasets. It includes a knowledge rule base and a knowledge-augmented baseline to enhance smaller models' performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing harmful content detection resources are mostly English-focused, leaving Chinese datasets scarce and limited. This work aims to fill that gap.

Method: A professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection is created, covering six categories. A knowledge-augmented baseline integrates human-annotated rules and LLM knowledge.

Result: The benchmark and knowledge-augmented baseline enable smaller models to perform comparably to state-of-the-art LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection.

Conclusion: The work provides a valuable resource for Chinese harmful content detection, bridging the gap in non-English datasets and improving model performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated
harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy
violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review.
However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly
focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in
scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for
Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and
is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further
yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist
LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a
knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge
rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoMind, an adaptive LLM-agent framework, improves automated data science by integrating expert knowledge, strategic search, and dynamic coding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-driven data science agents are limited by rigid workflows and lack empirical expertise for complex tasks.

Method: AutoMind introduces a curated expert knowledge base, agentic knowledgeable tree search, and self-adaptive coding strategy.

Result: AutoMind outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in benchmarks, showing effectiveness, efficiency, and high solution quality.

Conclusion: AutoMind represents a robust advancement toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

*Sohee Yang,Sang-Woo Lee,Nora Kassner,Daniela Gottesman,Sebastian Riedel,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Models can identify unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from them, especially larger models, impacting reasoning performance and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how effectively reasoning models can self-reevaluate and recover from unhelpful thoughts, including irrelevant or misleading reasoning.

Method: Investigating model performance in identifying and recovering from four types of unhelpful thoughts, including irrelevant or incorrect reasoning.

Result: Models identify most unhelpful thoughts but fail to recover, with larger models struggling more. Smaller models are less distracted by harmful thoughts.

Conclusion: Improvements in self-reevaluation are needed for better reasoning and safer AI systems.

Abstract: Recent reasoning models show the ability to reflect, backtrack, and
self-validate their reasoning, which is crucial in spotting mistakes and
arriving at accurate solutions. A natural question that arises is how
effectively models can perform such self-reevaluation. We tackle this question
by investigating how well reasoning models identify and recover from four types
of unhelpful thoughts: uninformative rambling thoughts, thoughts irrelevant to
the question, thoughts misdirecting the question as a slightly different
question, and thoughts that lead to incorrect answers. We show that models are
effective at identifying most unhelpful thoughts but struggle to recover from
the same thoughts when these are injected into their thinking process, causing
significant performance drops. Models tend to naively continue the line of
reasoning of the injected irrelevant thoughts, which showcases that their
self-reevaluation abilities are far from a general "meta-cognitive" awareness.
Moreover, we observe non/inverse-scaling trends, where larger models struggle
more than smaller ones to recover from short irrelevant thoughts, even when
instructed to reevaluate their reasoning. We demonstrate the implications of
these findings with a jailbreak experiment using irrelevant thought injection,
showing that the smallest models are the least distracted by
harmful-response-triggering thoughts. Overall, our findings call for
improvement in self-reevaluation of reasoning models to develop better
reasoning and safer systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A mask-based LoRA tuning method is proposed for flexible video editing using pretrained I2V models, preserving backgrounds and enabling controllable edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video editing methods lack flexibility for specific edits due to reliance on large-scale pretraining or limited control over frames.

Method: Uses mask-driven LoRA tuning to adapt pretrained I2V models, incorporating references and spatial masks for region-specific learning.

Result: Achieves superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The method offers efficient, adaptable video editing without altering model architecture.

Abstract: Video editing using diffusion models has achieved remarkable results in
generating high-quality edits for videos. However, current methods often rely
on large-scale pretraining, limiting flexibility for specific edits.
First-frame-guided editing provides control over the first frame, but lacks
flexibility over subsequent frames. To address this, we propose a mask-based
LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) tuning method that adapts pretrained Image-to-Video
(I2V) models for flexible video editing. Our approach preserves background
regions while enabling controllable edits propagation. This solution offers
efficient and adaptable video editing without altering the model architecture.
To better steer this process, we incorporate additional references, such as
alternate viewpoints or representative scene states, which serve as visual
anchors for how content should unfold. We address the control challenge using a
mask-driven LoRA tuning strategy that adapts a pre-trained image-to-video model
to the editing context. The model must learn from two distinct sources: the
input video provides spatial structure and motion cues, while reference images
offer appearance guidance. A spatial mask enables region-specific learning by
dynamically modulating what the model attends to, ensuring that each area draws
from the appropriate source. Experimental results show our method achieves
superior video editing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepTraverse introduces a vision architecture inspired by algorithmic search, enabling adaptive, structured feature refinement for improved performance and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limited adaptive refinement in conventional vision backbones by integrating principles from classical search algorithms for more structured and logical processing.

Method: DeepTraverse uses recursive exploration modules for deepening feature analysis and adaptive calibration modules for dynamic feature salience adjustment.

Result: Outperforms conventional models in image classification benchmarks with competitive accuracy and robust feature discrimination.

Conclusion: Integrating algorithmic priors offers a principled strategy for efficient, performant, and structured vision backbones.

Abstract: Conventional vision backbones, despite their success, often construct
features through a largely uniform cascade of operations, offering limited
explicit pathways for adaptive, iterative refinement. This raises a compelling
question: can principles from classical search algorithms instill a more
algorithmic, structured, and logical processing flow within these networks,
leading to representations built through more interpretable, perhaps
reasoning-like decision processes? We introduce DeepTraverse, a novel vision
architecture directly inspired by algorithmic search strategies, enabling it to
learn features through a process of systematic elucidation and adaptive
refinement distinct from conventional approaches. DeepTraverse operationalizes
this via two key synergistic components: recursive exploration modules that
methodically deepen feature analysis along promising representational paths
with parameter sharing for efficiency, and adaptive calibration modules that
dynamically adjust feature salience based on evolving global context. The
resulting algorithmic interplay allows DeepTraverse to intelligently construct
and refine feature patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across a diverse suite
of image classification benchmarks show that DeepTraverse achieves highly
competitive classification accuracy and robust feature discrimination, often
outperforming conventional models with similar or larger parameter counts. Our
work demonstrates that integrating such algorithmic priors provides a
principled and effective strategy for building more efficient, performant, and
structured vision backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientVLA is a training-free framework that accelerates Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by addressing computational and memory redundancies through pruning, visual token optimization, and feature caching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational and memory demands in VLA models limit practical deployability, and existing solutions fail to address bottlenecks holistically.

Method: EfficientVLA integrates three strategies: pruning redundant language layers, optimizing visual tokens, and caching features in the diffusion-based action head.

Result: Applied to CogACT, EfficientVLA achieves a 1.93X speedup, reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6% success rate drop.

Conclusion: EfficientVLA provides a holistic and efficient solution for accelerating VLA models without significant performance loss.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, particularly diffusion-based
architectures, demonstrate transformative potential for embodied intelligence
but are severely hampered by high computational and memory demands stemming
from extensive inherent and inference-time redundancies. While existing
acceleration efforts often target isolated inefficiencies, such piecemeal
solutions typically fail to holistically address the varied computational and
memory bottlenecks across the entire VLA pipeline, thereby limiting practical
deployability. We introduce EfficientVLA, a structured and training-free
inference acceleration framework that systematically eliminates these barriers
by cohesively exploiting multifaceted redundancies. EfficientVLA
synergistically integrates three targeted strategies: (1) pruning of
functionally inconsequential layers from the language module, guided by an
analysis of inter-layer redundancies; (2) optimizing the visual processing
pathway through a task-aware strategy that selects a compact, diverse set of
visual tokens, balancing task-criticality with informational coverage; and (3)
alleviating temporal computational redundancy within the iterative

intermediate features. We apply our method to a standard VLA model CogACT,
yielding a 1.93X inference speedup and reduces FLOPs to 28.9%, with only a 0.6%
success rate drop in the SIMPLER benchmark.

TL;DR: The paper introduces ICCWD, a multi-modal dataset for benchmarking tools that detect depictions of minors, addressing a gap in existing resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tools lack a standardized dataset for detecting minors in multi-modal content, necessitating the creation of ICCWD.

Method: The authors compiled 10,000 image-caption pairs, manually labeled for child presence, and benchmarked three detectors, including a commercial age estimation system.

Result: Child detection proved challenging, with the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate.

Conclusion: ICCWD aims to improve minor detection methods across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Platforms and the law regulate digital content depicting minors (defined as
individuals under 18 years of age) differently from other types of content.
Given the sheer amount of content that needs to be assessed, machine
learning-based automation tools are commonly used to detect content depicting
minors. To our knowledge, no dataset or benchmark currently exists for
detecting these identification methods in a multi-modal environment. To fill
this gap, we release the Image-Caption Children in the Wild Dataset (ICCWD), an
image-caption dataset aimed at benchmarking tools that detect depictions of
minors. Our dataset is richer than previous child image datasets, containing
images of children in a variety of contexts, including fictional depictions and
partially visible bodies. ICCWD contains 10,000 image-caption pairs manually
labeled to indicate the presence or absence of a child in the image. To
demonstrate the possible utility of our dataset, we use it to benchmark three
different detectors, including a commercial age estimation system applied to
images. Our results suggest that child detection is a challenging task, with
the best method achieving a 75.3% true positive rate. We hope the release of
our dataset will aid in the design of better minor detection methods in a wide
range of scenarios.

Motivation: To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of CNNs and ViTs in classifying psoriasis and similar lesions in medical images.

Method: Pre-trained models (CNNs and ViTs) were adapted to a specific dataset for multi-class image classification.

Result: ViTs, particularly DaViT-B, achieved superior performance (96.4% f1-score) with smaller models.

Conclusion: ViTs, especially DaViT-B, are recommended for automated psoriasis detection due to their efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural

TL;DR: ViCrit introduces an RL task for VLMs to localize subtle visual hallucinations in captions, improving perception and generalizing beyond training data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend RL success in LLMs to VLMs by addressing the lack of challenging yet verifiable vision-centric tasks.

Method: Train VLMs to detect and localize synthetic visual hallucinations in captions, using binary rewards for exact matches.

Result: Models show significant gains on VL benchmarks, with improvements transferring to abstract reasoning and visual math.

Conclusion: Fine-grained hallucination criticism enhances visual perception in VLMs, demonstrating generalizability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great effectiveness for fine-tuning
large language models (LLMs) using tasks that are challenging yet easily
verifiable, such as math reasoning or code generation. However, extending this
success to visual perception in vision-language models (VLMs) has been impeded
by the scarcity of vision-centric tasks that are simultaneously challenging and
unambiguously verifiable. To this end, we introduce ViCrit (Visual Caption
Hallucination Critic), an RL proxy task that trains VLMs to localize a subtle,
synthetic visual hallucination injected into paragraphs of human-written image
captions. Starting from a 200-word captions, we inject a single, subtle visual
description error-altering a few words on objects, attributes, counts, or
spatial relations-and task the model to pinpoint the corrupted span given the
image and the modified caption. This formulation preserves the full perceptual
difficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute
and unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains
across a variety of VL benchmarks. Crucially, the improvements transfer beyond
natural-image training data to abstract image reasoning and visual math,
showing promises of learning to perceive rather than barely memorizing seen
objects. To facilitate evaluation, we further introduce ViCrit-Bench, a
category-balanced diagnostic benchmark that systematically probes perception
errors across diverse image domains and error types. Together, our results
demonstrate that fine-grained hallucination criticism is an effective and
generalizable objective for enhancing visual perception in VLMs.

TL;DR: RoCA is a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E autonomous driving, improving generalizability and adaptation without extra inference costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of deploying E2E autonomous driving across domains, particularly avoiding prohibitive retraining costs and leveraging LLMs' open-world knowledge.

Method: RoCA formulates a joint probabilistic distribution over tokens encoding vehicle information, using Gaussian processes to learn basis tokens and trajectories for diverse scenarios.

Result: RoCA enhances the base E2E model's generalizability and outperforms direct finetuning in domain adaptation.

Conclusion: RoCA achieves strong performance in cross-domain scenarios, offering robust generalization and adaptation for autonomous driving.

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently emerged as a new paradigm,
offering significant potential. However, few studies have looked into the
practical challenge of deployment across domains (e.g., cities). Although
several works have incorporated Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their
open-world knowledge, LLMs do not guarantee cross-domain driving performance
and may incur prohibitive retraining costs during domain adaptation. In this
paper, we propose RoCA, a novel framework for robust cross-domain E2E
autonomous driving. RoCA formulates the joint probabilistic distribution over
the tokens that encode ego and surrounding vehicle information in the E2E
pipeline. Instantiating with a Gaussian process (GP), RoCA learns a set of
basis tokens with corresponding trajectories, which span diverse driving
scenarios. Then, given any driving scene, it is able to probabilistically infer
the future trajectory. By using RoCA together with a base E2E model in
source-domain training, we improve the generalizability of the base model,
without requiring extra inference computation. In addition, RoCA enables robust
adaptation on new target domains, significantly outperforming direct
finetuning. We extensively evaluate RoCA on various cross-domain scenarios and
show that it achieves strong domain generalization and adaptation performance.

*Mohammad Jalali,Haoyu Lei,Amin Gohari,Farzan Farnia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces SPARKE, a method for enhancing diversity in prompt-guided diffusion models by using conditional entropy for prompt-aware diversity control, reducing computational complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models is challenging, especially across semantically similar prompts.

Method: Proposes SPARKE, which uses conditional entropy for diversity guidance, dynamically conditioning diversity measurement on similar prompts and reducing computational complexity from O(n³) to O(n).

Result: SPARKE improves prompt-aware diversity in generated data without significant computational costs, as tested on text-to-image diffusion models.

Conclusion: SPARKE effectively addresses diversity and computational challenges in prompt-guided diffusion models, offering scalable and efficient diversity guidance.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image
synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate
diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a
challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the
diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion
across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance
via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we
extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable
Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for
prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for
diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on
similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the
entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance
on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in
large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case
of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and
gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy
measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for
diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on
different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several
text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves
the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant
computational costs. We release our code on the project page:

*Yael Frischholz,Devis Tuia,Michael Lehning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes an attention-based emulator for accurate surface solar radiation (SSR) retrieval from satellite imagery, addressing challenges in mountainous regions with dynamic snow cover.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional methods using monthly statistics fail in mountainous areas due to intermittent snow cover. The goal is to improve SSR retrieval without relying on hand-crafted features.

Method: The approach uses a Temporo-Spatial Vision Transformer to learn clear-sky surface reflectance from raw satellite sequences, trained on HelioMont SSR estimates over Switzerland.

Result: The model matches albedo-informed models' performance, especially in mountainous regions, by learning latent surface reflectance dynamics.

Conclusion: The method enhances SSR retrieval accuracy in complex terrains and is publicly available for further use.

Abstract: Accurate retrieval of surface solar radiation (SSR) from satellite imagery
critically depends on estimating the background reflectance that a spaceborne
sensor would observe under clear-sky conditions. Deviations from this baseline
can then be used to detect cloud presence and guide radiative transfer models
in inferring atmospheric attenuation. Operational retrieval algorithms
typically approximate background reflectance using monthly statistics, assuming
surface properties vary slowly relative to atmospheric conditions. However,
this approach fails in mountainous regions where intermittent snow cover and
changing snow surfaces are frequent. We propose an attention-based emulator for
SSR retrieval that implicitly learns to infer clear-sky surface reflectance
from raw satellite image sequences. Built on the Temporo-Spatial Vision
Transformer, our approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features such as
explicit albedo maps or cloud masks. The emulator is trained on instantaneous
SSR estimates from the HelioMont algorithm over Switzerland, a region
characterized by complex terrain and dynamic snow cover. Inputs include
multi-spectral SEVIRI imagery from the Meteosat Second Generation platform,
augmented with static topographic features and solar geometry. The target
variable is HelioMont's SSR, computed as the sum of its direct and diffuse
horizontal irradiance components, given at a spatial resolution of 1.7 km. We
show that, when provided a sufficiently long temporal context, the model
matches the performances of albedo-informed models, highlighting the model's
ability to internally learn and exploit latent surface reflectance dynamics.
Our geospatial analysis shows this effect is most powerful in mountainous
regions and improves generalization in both simple and complex topographic
settings. Code and datasets are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Efficient Probing (EP), a method improving attentive probing for self-supervised learning by reducing parameters and boosting speed, outperforming linear probing and prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard linear probing fails for Masked Image Modeling due to patch tokens' distributed nature, while existing attentive probing methods are inefficient.

Method: EP uses multi-query cross-attention to eliminate redundant projections, reducing parameters and speeding up computation.

Result: EP achieves up to 10x speed-up, outperforms linear probing and prior methods across benchmarks, and generalizes well.

Conclusion: EP is efficient, interpretable, and effective, offering strong performance in diverse settings.

Abstract: As fine-tuning (FT) becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is
emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol for self-supervised learning
(SSL). Yet, the standard linear probing (LP) fails to adequately reflect the
potential of models trained with Masked Image Modeling (MIM), due to the
distributed nature of patch tokens. This motivates the need for attentive
probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate
patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains
under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization
and poor computational efficiency.
  In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the
accuracy-efficiency trade-off. We conduct a systematic study of existing
methods, analyzing their mechanisms and benchmarking their performance. We
introduce efficient probing (EP), a multi-query cross-attention mechanism that
eliminates redundant projections, reduces the number of trainable parameters,
and achieves up to a 10$\times$ speed-up over conventional multi-head
attention. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms LP and prior attentive
probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well beyond MIM to
diverse pre-training paradigms, produces interpretable attention maps, and
achieves strong gains in low-shot and layer-wise settings. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a method for personalized vision-language retrieval by adapting a dual encoder model, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recognize new personal concepts (e.g., 'my dog Fido') from few examples while integrating personal and general knowledge.

Method: Regularized low-rank adaption of parameters in the language encoder's final layer, combined with parameter addition for multiple concepts.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by 4%-22% on DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach effectively balances personal concept recognition with preservation of general knowledge.

Abstract: Personalized vision-language retrieval seeks to recognize new concepts (e.g.
"my dog Fido") from only a few examples. This task is challenging because it
requires not only learning a new concept from a few images, but also
integrating the personal and general knowledge together to recognize the
concept in different contexts. In this paper, we show how to effectively adapt
the internal representation of a vision-language dual encoder model for
personalized vision-language retrieval. We find that regularized low-rank
adaption of a small set of parameters in the language encoder's final layer
serves as a highly effective alternative to textual inversion for recognizing
the personal concept while preserving general knowledge. Additionally, we
explore strategies for combining parameters of multiple learned personal
concepts, finding that parameter addition is effective. To evaluate how well
general knowledge is preserved in a finetuned representation, we introduce a
metric that measures image retrieval accuracy based on captions generated by a
vision language model (VLM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on
two benchmarks for personalized image retrieval with natural language queries -
DeepFashion2 and ConCon-Chi - outperforming the prior art by 4%-22% on personal
retrievals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhancing discriminator performance in scenarios with limited labeled data by leveraging diffusion models.

Method: Convexly mixing scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling to generate challenging synthetic samples.

Result: Notable performance improvements in benchmarks, especially when mixing classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space.

Conclusion: ScoreMix is practical for training discriminative models and mitigates the need for large datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation
strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to
enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited
labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned
trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic
samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied
benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing
and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes
distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the
generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard
metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and
the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable
performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating
practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively
mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets. Paper website:

TL;DR: A study introduces a benchmark dataset and multi-modal deep learning model for accurate crop yield forecasting in California, achieving strong predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and timely crop yield forecasting is challenging due to complex environmental and climatic factors, despite extensive historical data.

Method: Developed a multi-modal deep learning model integrating Landsat imagery, climate records, evapotranspiration, and soil data, using stratified feature extraction and timeseries encoders.

Result: Achieved an R2 score of 0.76 across all crops in unseen test data, demonstrating robust predictive performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark and model provide a foundation for improving agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation, and precision farming, with publicly available data and code.

Abstract: California is a global leader in agricultural production, contributing 12.5%
of the United States total output and ranking as the fifth-largest food and
cotton supplier in the world. Despite the availability of extensive historical
yield data from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, accurate and
timely crop yield forecasting remains a challenge due to the complex interplay
of environmental, climatic, and soil-related factors. In this study, we
introduce a comprehensive crop yield benchmark dataset covering over 70 crops
across all California counties from 2008 to 2022. The benchmark integrates
diverse data sources, including Landsat satellite imagery, daily climate
records, monthly evapotranspiration, and high-resolution soil properties. To
effectively learn from these heterogeneous inputs, we develop a multi-modal
deep learning model tailored for county-level, crop-specific yield forecasting.
The model employs stratified feature extraction and a timeseries encoder to
capture spatial and temporal dynamics during the growing season. Static inputs
such as soil characteristics and crop identity inform long-term variability.
Our approach achieves an overall R2 score of 0.76 across all crops of unseen
test dataset, highlighting strong predictive performance across California
diverse agricultural regions. This benchmark and modeling framework offer a
valuable foundation for advancing agricultural forecasting, climate adaptation,
and precision farming. The full dataset and codebase are publicly available at

TL;DR: DySS introduces a state-space model and dynamic queries for efficient 3D object detection in BEV, achieving superior performance and real-time speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the inefficiency of dense BEV features and sparse query-based methods in 3D object detection, especially with multiple video frames.

Method: Uses a state-space model (SSM) for sequential feature processing, with auxiliary tasks (future prediction, masked reconstruction) to enhance motion and correspondence learning. Dynamically updates queries via merge, remove, and split operations.

Result: Achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP on nuScenes test split, 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP on val split, with 33 FPS real-time inference.

Conclusion: DySS offers a lean, efficient solution for 3D object detection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection in Bird's Eye View (BEV) is one of the most
important perception tasks in autonomous driving. Earlier methods rely on dense
BEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse
query-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries
and can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,
we propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic
queries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to
sequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to
encourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence
information, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked
reconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an
informative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space
learned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and
split operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries
throughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection
performance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,
DySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the
art. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a
real-time inference speed of 33 FPS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hallucination detection methods are computationally intensive and lack nuance for ambiguous cases, limiting reliability in critical applications.

Method: HalLoc provides 150K token-level annotated samples across VQA, instruction-following, and captioning tasks, enabling graded confidence detection. A baseline model is also introduced for low-overhead, concurrent detection.

Result: The dataset and model improve hallucination detection with probabilistic confidence, enhancing reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Conclusion: HalLoc advances trustworthy vision-language models by offering a plug-and-play solution for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability of large
vision-language models, making their detection essential for ensuring accuracy
in critical applications. Current detection methods often rely on
computationally intensive models, leading to high latency and resource demands.
Their definitive outcomes also fail to account for real-world scenarios where
the line between hallucinated and truthful information is unclear. To address
these issues, we propose HalLoc, a dataset designed for efficient,
probabilistic hallucination detection. It features 150K token-level annotated
samples, including hallucination types, across Visual Question Answering (VQA),
instruction-following, and image captioning tasks. This dataset facilitates the
development of models that detect hallucinations with graded confidence,
enabling more informed user interactions. Additionally, we introduce a baseline
model trained on HalLoc, offering low-overhead, concurrent hallucination
detection during generation. The model can be seamlessly integrated into
existing VLMs, improving reliability while preserving efficiency. The prospect
of a robust plug-and-play hallucination detection module opens new avenues for
enhancing the trustworthiness of vision-language models in real-world
applications. The HalLoc dataset and code are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates deep learning models for skin cancer classification, highlighting CLIP-based vision transformers with SVM as top performers and emphasizing the role of uncertainty quantification for reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate skin cancer diagnosis is crucial for early treatment, but deep learning models face challenges like data scarcity and lack of uncertainty awareness.

Method: Benchmarked pre-trained feature extractors (e.g., CLIP, ResNet50) with traditional classifiers (SVM, XGBoost), then incorporated uncertainty quantification (MCD, Ensemble, EMCD) using uncertainty-aware metrics.

Result: CLIP-based models with SVM performed best. Ensemble methods balanced accuracy and uncertainty, while EMCD was more sensitive to uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: Integrating uncertainty quantification enhances DL-based medical diagnosis, improving performance and trustworthiness for clinical use.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment
and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in
automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by
data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a
comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer
learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the
first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50
(ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual
Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range
of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that
CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM,
deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we
incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte
Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the
reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware
metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen),
uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results
demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and
uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions.
This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical
diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world
clinical applications.

TL;DR: A weakly supervised multimodal framework generates SOAP notes from lesion images and sparse clinical text, reducing manual effort and matching GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro in performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skin carcinoma is costly and prevalent, and manual SOAP note generation is labor-intensive, contributing to clinician burnout.

Method: A weakly supervised multimodal framework uses lesion images and sparse clinical text to generate SOAP notes, minimizing manual annotations.

Result: The method performs comparably to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro, with novel metrics (MedConceptEval and CCS) validating clinical quality.

Conclusion: The framework offers scalable, clinically grounded documentation, reducing clinician burden and annotation needs.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for
over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings,
physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective,
Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is
labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose
a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP
notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text.
Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable,
clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and
reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance
comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical
relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics
MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic
alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

the study of audio-visual quality assessment (AVQA) within ODVs remains
limited. To address this, we construct a dataset of UGC omnidirectional audio
and video (A/V) content. The videos are captured by five individuals using two
different types of omnidirectional cameras, shooting 300 videos covering 10
different scene types. A subjective AVQA experiment is conducted on the dataset
to obtain the Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) of the A/V sequences. After that, to
facilitate the development of UGC-ODV AVQA fields, we construct an effective
AVQA baseline model on the proposed dataset, of which the baseline model
consists of video feature extraction module, audio feature extraction and
audio-visual fusion module. The experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves optimal performance on the proposed dataset.

### [80] [Using Vision Language Models to Detect Students' Academic Emotion through Facial Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10334)
*Deliang Wang,Chao Yang,Gaowei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study explores using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for zero-shot analysis of students' academic emotions from facial expressions, finding moderate success with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional supervised models struggle with generalization across contexts, prompting the need for alternatives like VLMs.

Method: Two VLMs analyzed 5,000 images of academic emotions (confused, distracted, happy, neutral, tired) using zero-shot prompting.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct performed better, excelling in happy and confused expressions but failing in distracted behavior.

Conclusion: VLMs show promise for academic emotion analysis, particularly Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct for identifying confusion.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and
learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately
analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning
algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different
contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and
training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising
alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through
zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the
potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions
in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs,
Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000
images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions
using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models
demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition,
with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct.
Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to
detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits
relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions,
highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content
that causes student confusion.

*Lintao Xiang,Hongpei Zheng,Yating Huang,Qijun Yang,Hujun Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) framework improves rendering quality from sparse views by using stereo foundation models, multiscale feature encoding, and a self-attention-based point interaction network.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3DGS methods require many calibrated views and overfit with sparse inputs, degrading rendering quality.

Method: Uses stereo foundation models for pose estimation and dense point cloud reconstruction, encodes multiscale 2D features, and employs a self-attention network for point interaction.

Result: Outperforms NeRF-based methods and competes with state-of-the-art 3DGS under few-shot settings.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables high-quality, real-time rendering from sparse views, addressing limitations of current 3DGS approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that
surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual
quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS
approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent
and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to
overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering
quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware
Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering
from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo
foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense
point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes
of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance
features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation,
we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism,
allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These
enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two
lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under
few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.

### [82] [GeoCAD: Local Geometry-Controllable CAD Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10337)
*Zhanwei Zhang,Kaiyuan Liu,Junjie Liu,Wenxiao Wang,Binbin Lin,Liang Xie,Chen Shen,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoCAD introduces a method for local geometry-controllable CAD generation, addressing limitations of existing methods by using complementary captioning and LLMs for precise local part modifications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD generation methods struggle with following textual instructions or focusing on local parts, hindering design efficiency and user-specific customization.

Method: GeoCAD employs a complementary captioning strategy (vertex-based and VLLM-based) to annotate local parts, then uses LLMs to predict masked parts during training and inference.

Result: GeoCAD demonstrates effectiveness in generation quality, validity, and text-to-CAD consistency, with extensive experiments validating its performance.

Conclusion: GeoCAD offers a user-friendly solution for local geometry-controllable CAD generation, enabling precise modifications based on geometric instructions.

Abstract: Local geometry-controllable computer-aided design (CAD) generation aims to
modify local parts of CAD models automatically, enhancing design efficiency. It
also ensures that the shapes of newly generated local parts follow
user-specific geometric instructions (e.g., an isosceles right triangle or a
rectangle with one corner cut off). However, existing methods encounter
challenges in achieving this goal. Specifically, they either lack the ability
to follow textual instructions or are unable to focus on the local parts. To
address this limitation, we introduce GeoCAD, a user-friendly and local
geometry-controllable CAD generation method. Specifically, we first propose a
complementary captioning strategy to generate geometric instructions for local
parts. This strategy involves vertex-based and VLLM-based captioning for
systematically annotating simple and complex parts, respectively. In this way,
we caption $\sim$221k different local parts in total. In the training stage,
given a CAD model, we randomly mask a local part. Then, using its geometric
instruction and the remaining parts as input, we prompt large language models
(LLMs) to predict the masked part. During inference, users can specify any
local part for modification while adhering to a variety of predefined geometric
instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoCAD in
generation quality, validity and text-to-CAD consistency. Code will be
available at https://github.com/Zhanwei-Z/GeoCAD.

*Jun Yin,Jing Zhong,Peilin Li,Pengyu Zeng,Miao Zhang,Ran Luo,Shuai Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a multimodal framework using vision-language models to analyze urban streetscape styles, addressing limitations of traditional methods. It introduces UrbanDiffBench dataset and UrbanSense framework, achieving high accuracy in capturing stylistic differences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding urban cultural and architectural differences is crucial for predicting city evolution. Traditional methods lack standardization, prompting the need for automated, scalable analysis.

Method: A vision-language-model-based framework (UrbanSense) is developed for quantitative analysis of urban streetscapes, supported by the UrbanDiffBench dataset.

Result: Over 80% of generated descriptions are statistically significant (p < 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) validate the method's accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework offers a data-driven, objective approach to studying urban style evolution, with potential applications in future urban design.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due
to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors.
Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may
evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and
modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives
for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional
approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and
historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different
contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on
vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban
streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and
data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are
as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban
streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and
regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based
framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation
and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show
that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05).
High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective
evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic
differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and
interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for
future design.

*Mina C. Moghadam,Alan Q. Wang,Omer Taub,Martin R. Prince,Mert R. Sabuncu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RKM is a resolution-agnostic method for medical image registration, avoiding resampling artifacts by using real-world coordinates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods resample images to fixed resolutions, introducing artifacts. RKM aims to address this by working directly on raw data.

Method: RKM extends KeyMorph by training a network to learn keypoints in real-world coordinates, leveraging scanner affine matrices.

Result: RKM outperforms traditional methods in registering 2D and 3D medical images with varying resolutions.

Conclusion: RKM provides a robust, resolution-agnostic solution for medical image registration, avoiding resampling artifacts.

Abstract: Many real-world settings require registration of a pair of medical images
that differ in spatial resolution, which may arise from differences in image
acquisition parameters like pixel spacing, slice thickness, and field-of-view.
However, all previous machine learning-based registration techniques resample
images onto a fixed resolution. This is suboptimal because resampling can
introduce artifacts due to interpolation. To address this, we present
RealKeyMorph (RKM), a resolution-agnostic method for image registration. RKM is
an extension of KeyMorph, a registration framework which works by training a
network to learn corresponding keypoints for a given pair of images, after
which a closed-form keypoint matching step is used to derive the transformation
that aligns them. To avoid resampling and enable operating on the raw data, RKM
outputs keypoints in real-world coordinates of the scanner. To do this, we
leverage the affine matrix produced by the scanner (e.g., MRI machine) that
encodes the mapping from voxel coordinates to real world coordinates. By
transforming keypoints into real-world space and integrating this into the
training process, RKM effectively enables the extracted keypoints to be
resolution-agnostic. In our experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of RKM
on the registration task for orthogonal 2D stacks of abdominal MRIs, as well as
3D volumes with varying resolutions in brain datasets.

*Runqi Ouyang,Haoyun Li,Zhenyuan Zhang,Xiaofeng Wang,Zheng Zhu,Guan Huang,Xingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-R1 is a new framework for text-to-motion generation that uses Chain-of-Thought reasoning to improve controllability and diversity in motion synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack deep linguistic understanding and logical reasoning, leading to inconsistent and less controllable motion generation.

Method: Motion-R1 decomposes text instructions into structured action paths and uses Group Relative Policy Optimization for joint optimization of reasoning and motion synthesis.

Result: Motion-R1 outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic understanding and long-term coherence.

Conclusion: The framework enhances motion generation by integrating logical reasoning and reinforcement learning, with plans for public release.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models, especially in natural language
understanding and reasoning, have opened new possibilities for text-to-motion
generation. Although existing approaches have made notable progress in semantic
alignment and motion synthesis, they often rely on end-to-end mapping
strategies that fail to capture deep linguistic structures and logical
reasoning. Consequently, generated motions tend to lack controllability,
consistency, and diversity. To address these limitations, we propose Motion-R1,
a unified motion-language modeling framework that integrates a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism. By explicitly decomposing complex textual instructions into
logically structured action paths, Motion-R1 provides high-level semantic
guidance for motion generation, significantly enhancing the model's ability to
interpret and execute multi-step, long-horizon, and compositionally rich
commands. To train our model, we adopt Group Relative Policy Optimization, a
reinforcement learning algorithm designed for large models, which leverages
motion quality feedback to optimize reasoning chains and motion synthesis
jointly. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that Motion-R1 achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced semantic
understanding and long-term temporal coherence. The code, model and data will
be publicly available.

performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight models. MHLA notably
improves inference speed, allowing FaceLiVT to deliver high accuracy with lower
latency on mobile devices. Specifically, FaceLiVT is 8.6 faster than EdgeFace,
a recent hybrid CNN-Transformer model optimized for edge devices, and 21.2
faster than a pure ViT-Based model. With its balanced design, FaceLiVT offers
an efficient and practical solution for real-time face recognition on

*Tianpei Zhang,Jufeng Zhao,Yiming Zhu,Guangmang Cui,Yuhan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FSATFusion, a Transformer-based network for infrared and visible image fusion, addressing global context loss in CNNs with frequency-spatial attention and improved Transformer modules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CNN-based methods for IVIF lose global context, limiting fusion performance.

Method: Introduces FSATFusion with FSAT (frequency-spatial attention Transformer) and ITM (improved Transformer module) to enhance feature extraction.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fusion quality, efficiency, and generalization.

Conclusion: FSATFusion excels in IVIF and downstream tasks like object detection, demonstrating robustness and versatility.

Abstract: The infrared and visible images fusion (IVIF) is receiving increasing
attention from both the research community and industry due to its excellent
results in downstream applications. Existing deep learning approaches often
utilize convolutional neural networks to extract image features. However, the
inherently capacity of convolution operations to capture global context can
lead to information loss, thereby restricting fusion performance. To address
this limitation, we propose an end-to-end fusion network named the
Frequency-Spatial Attention Transformer Fusion Network (FSATFusion). The
FSATFusion contains a frequency-spatial attention Transformer (FSAT) module
designed to effectively capture discriminate features from source images. This
FSAT module includes a frequency-spatial attention mechanism (FSAM) capable of
extracting significant features from feature maps. Additionally, we propose an
improved Transformer module (ITM) to enhance the ability to extract global
context information of vanilla Transformer. We conducted both qualitative and
quantitative comparative experiments, demonstrating the superior fusion quality
and efficiency of FSATFusion compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, our network was tested on two additional tasks without any
modifications, to verify the excellent generalization capability of FSATFusion.
Finally, the object detection experiment demonstrated the superiority of
FSATFusion in downstream visual tasks. Our code is available at

*Laziz U. Abdullaev,Maksim Tkachenko,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper aims to provide a theoretical foundation for the self-attention mechanism in Transformers by linking it to image processing, improving interpretability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The self-attention mechanism lacks a robust theoretical explanation despite its success. The paper seeks to bridge this gap by connecting it to image processing principles.

Method: The authors develop a unifying image processing framework to explain self-attention and its components (e.g., positional encoding, residual connections). They also introduce two architectural modifications.

Result: The framework enhances interpretability and empirically improves accuracy, robustness, and long-sequence understanding in language and vision tasks.

Conclusion: The work advances the theoretical understanding of self-attention and demonstrates practical benefits through image processing-inspired modifications.

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, a cornerstone of Transformer-based
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, is largely heuristic-driven and
fundamentally challenging to interpret. Establishing a robust theoretical
foundation to explain its remarkable success and limitations has therefore
become an increasingly prominent focus in recent research. Some notable
directions have explored understanding self-attention through the lens of image
denoising and nonparametric regression. While promising, existing frameworks
still lack a deeper mechanistic interpretation of various architectural
components that enhance self-attention, both in its original formulation and
subsequent variants. In this work, we aim to advance this understanding by
developing a unifying image processing framework, capable of explaining not
only the self-attention computation itself but also the role of components such
as positional encoding and residual connections, including numerous later
variants. We also pinpoint potential distinctions between the two concepts
building upon our framework, and make effort to close this gap. We introduce
two independent architectural modifications within transformers. While our
primary objective is interpretability, we empirically observe that image
processing-inspired modifications can also lead to notably improved accuracy
and robustness against data contamination and adversaries across language and
vision tasks as well as better long sequence understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseIDON, a computer vision pipeline, estimates seafloor object burial depth using deep learning and photogrammetry, achieving ~10 cm accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding burial dynamics of seafloor objects is crucial for ecological risk assessment and pollutant transport analysis.

Method: Combines deep foundation model features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate object pose and seafloor orientation from ROV video, aligning CAD models for depth inference.

Result: Validated on 54 objects, achieving ~10 cm mean burial depth error and revealing sediment transport patterns.

Conclusion: PoseIDON enables scalable, non-invasive seafloor burial mapping, aiding environmental assessments at contaminated sites.

Abstract: The burial state of anthropogenic objects on the seafloor provides insight
into localized sedimentation dynamics and is also critical for assessing
ecological risks, potential pollutant transport, and the viability of recovery
or mitigation strategies for hazardous materials such as munitions. Accurate
burial depth estimation from remote imagery remains difficult due to partial
occlusion, poor visibility, and object degradation. This work introduces a
computer vision pipeline, called PoseIDON, which combines deep foundation model
features with multiview photogrammetry to estimate six degrees of freedom
object pose and the orientation of the surrounding seafloor from ROV video.
Burial depth is inferred by aligning CAD models of the objects with observed
imagery and fitting a local planar approximation of the seafloor. The method is
validated using footage of 54 objects, including barrels and munitions,
recorded at a historic ocean dumpsite in the San Pedro Basin. The model
achieves a mean burial depth error of approximately 10 centimeters and resolves
spatial burial patterns that reflect underlying sediment transport processes.
This approach enables scalable, non-invasive mapping of seafloor burial and
supports environmental assessment at contaminated sites.

*Shicheng Yin,Kaixuan Yin,Yang Liu,Weixing Chen,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DART is a dynamic adaptive region tokenizer that improves vision models by adaptively partitioning images into content-dependent patches, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-size patches in non-convolutional models like ViT and Vim often miss critical local details or encode excessive background regions, especially for sparsely distributed objects.

Method: DART uses learnable region scores and differentiable quantile operations to create varying-sized patches, allocating denser tokens to information-rich areas.

Result: DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K) with only ~1M extra parameters, reduces FLOPs by 45%, and maintains or reduces computational overhead.

Conclusion: DART consistently enhances model performance across DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba, offering a more efficient alternative to uniform token density methods.

Abstract: Recently, non-convolutional models such as the Vision Transformer (ViT) and
Vision Mamba (Vim) have achieved remarkable performance in computer vision
tasks. However, their reliance on fixed-size patches often results in excessive
encoding of background regions and omission of critical local details,
especially when informative objects are sparsely distributed. To address this,
we introduce a fully differentiable Dynamic Adaptive Region Tokenizer (DART),
which adaptively partitions images into content-dependent patches of varying
sizes. DART combines learnable region scores with piecewise differentiable
quantile operations to allocate denser tokens to information-rich areas.
Despite introducing only approximately 1 million (1M) additional parameters,
DART improves accuracy by 2.1% on DeiT (ImageNet-1K). Unlike methods that
uniformly increase token density to capture fine-grained details, DART offers a
more efficient alternative, achieving 45% FLOPs reduction with superior
performance. Extensive experiments on DeiT, Vim, and VideoMamba confirm that
DART consistently enhances accuracy while incurring minimal or even reduced
computational overhead. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion model for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction, addressing sparse data and cloud occlusion issues with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate ocean reconstruction is vital for climate dynamics and marine research, but conventional methods struggle with data sparsity and computational costs, while ML methods are limited to surface or local regions.

Method: Pre-trains an unconditional diffusion model on historical simulation data, then uses sparse in-situ observations to guide the reverse diffusion process for reconstruction.

Result: Achieves MSE values of 0.049 (guidance), 0.680 (reconstruction), and 0.633 (total), handling over 92.5% missing data with high accuracy.

Conclusion: ReconMOST effectively extends ML-based reconstruction globally and multi-layered, demonstrating robustness and superior generalization.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of ocean is essential for reflecting global climate
dynamics and supporting marine meteorological research. Conventional methods
face challenges due to sparse data, algorithmic complexity, and high
computational costs, while increasing usage of machine learning (ML) method
remains limited to reconstruction problems at the sea surface and local
regions, struggling with issues like cloud occlusion. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes ReconMOST, a data-driven guided diffusion
model framework for multi-layer sea temperature reconstruction. Specifically,
we first pre-train an unconditional diffusion model using a large collection of
historical numerical simulation data, enabling the model to attain physically
consistent distribution patterns of ocean temperature fields. During the
generation phase, sparse yet high-accuracy in-situ observational data are
utilized as guidance points for the reverse diffusion process, generating
accurate reconstruction results. Importantly, in regions lacking direct
observational data, the physically consistent spatial distribution patterns
learned during pre-training enable implicitly guided and physically plausible
reconstructions. Our method extends ML-based SST reconstruction to a global,
multi-layer setting, handling over 92.5% missing data while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy, spatial resolution, and superior generalization
capability. We pre-train our model on CMIP6 numerical simulation data and
conduct guided reconstruction experiments on CMIP6 and EN4 analysis data. The
results of mean squared error (MSE) values achieve 0.049 on guidance, 0.680 on
reconstruction, and 0.633 on total, respectively, demonstrating the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Our source code is

TL;DR: Pisces, a multimodal foundation model, uses decoupled visual encoding and tailored training to excel in both image understanding and generation, outperforming specialized models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the underperformance of unified models in image understanding and generation due to differing visual features and training needs.

Method: Introduces Pisces with a decoupled visual encoding architecture and optimized training techniques, along with data curation and finetuning.

Result: Achieves strong performance on 20+ image understanding benchmarks and robust generative capabilities on GenEval.

Conclusion: Pisces demonstrates the synergy between image understanding and generation, advancing unified multimodal models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal
foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform
compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing
unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features
needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct
training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce
Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this
challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored
training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with
meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves
competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We
evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it
demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on
GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits
robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic
relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of
using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal
models.

*Guoyi Zhang,Guangsheng Xu,Siyang Chen,Han Wang,Xiaohu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRRNet is a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework that leverages low-rank background properties for improved small target detection in complex infrared scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small target detection is challenging due to low SCR, diverse target shapes, and lack of visual cues. Existing deep learning methods struggle with variability and weak priors.

Method: LRRNet uses a compression-reconstruction-subtraction (CRS) paradigm to model low-rank backgrounds directly in the image domain, avoiding patch-based processing or matrix decomposition.

Result: LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and speed (82.34 FPS), and shows resilience to noise on the NoisySIRST dataset.

Conclusion: LRRNet is the first end-to-end deep learning approach to directly learn low-rank background structures, achieving superior performance and real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) remains a long-standing challenge in
complex backgrounds due to low signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR), diverse target
morphologies, and the absence of distinctive visual cues. While recent deep
learning approaches aim to learn discriminative representations, the intrinsic
variability and weak priors of small targets often lead to unstable
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end IRSTD framework,
termed LRRNet, which leverages the low-rank property of infrared image
backgrounds. Inspired by the physical compressibility of cluttered scenes, our
approach adopts a compression--reconstruction--subtraction (CRS) paradigm to
directly model structure-aware low-rank background representations in the image
domain, without relying on patch-based processing or explicit matrix
decomposition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly
learn low-rank background structures using deep neural networks in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets
demonstrate that LRRNet outperforms 38 state-of-the-art methods in terms of
detection accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Remarkably, it
achieves real-time performance with an average speed of 82.34 FPS. Evaluations
on the challenging NoisySIRST dataset further confirm the model's resilience to
sensor noise. The source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: MF2Summ is a multimodal video summarization model combining visual and auditory data, outperforming traditional single-modality methods with improved F1-scores on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional video summarization methods rely on a single modality, limiting semantic richness. MF2Summ addresses this by integrating visual and auditory information for better performance.

Method: MF2Summ uses a five-stage process: feature extraction (GoogLeNet for visuals, SoundNet for audio), cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key shot selection (NMS and KTS).

Result: MF2Summ achieves competitive results, improving F1-scores by 1.9% and 0.6% on SumMe and TVSum datasets compared to DSNet.

Conclusion: MF2Summ demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in video summarization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of online video content necessitates effective video
summarization techniques. Traditional methods, often relying on a single
modality (typically visual), struggle to capture the full semantic richness of
videos. This paper introduces MF2Summ, a novel video summarization model based
on multimodal content understanding, integrating both visual and auditory
information. MF2Summ employs a five-stage process: feature extraction,
cross-modal attention interaction, feature fusion, segment prediction, and key
shot selection. Visual features are extracted using a pre-trained GoogLeNet
model, while auditory features are derived using SoundNet. The core of our
fusion mechanism involves a cross-modal Transformer and an alignment-guided
self-attention Transformer, designed to effectively model inter-modal
dependencies and temporal correspondences. Segment importance, location, and
center-ness are predicted, followed by key shot selection using Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and the Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS) algorithm.
Experimental results on the SumMe and TVSum datasets demonstrate that MF2Summ
achieves competitive performance, notably improving F1-scores by 1.9\% and
0.6\% respectively over the DSNet model, and performing favorably against other
state-of-the-art methods.

*Guowei Zhong,Ruohong Huan,Mingzhen Wu,Ronghua Liang,Peng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIDer is a robust MER framework addressing modality missing and OOD data with MSSD and MACI modules, achieving efficient performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges in MER include modality missing and OOD data, with existing methods being impractical due to model specificity or excessive parameters.

Method: CIDer integrates MSSD for robustness under RMFM and MACI for OOD generalization, using self-distillation, causal inference, and efficient multimodal fusion.

Result: CIDer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in RMFM and OOD scenarios with fewer parameters and faster training.

Conclusion: CIDer provides a practical and efficient solution for robust MER, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) face challenges
in addressing both modality missing and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data
simultaneously. Existing methods often rely on specific models or introduce
excessive parameters, which limits their practicality. To address these issues,
we propose a novel robust MER framework, Causal Inference Distiller (CIDer),
and introduce a new task, Random Modality Feature Missing (RMFM), to generalize
the definition of modality missing. CIDer integrates two key components: a
Model-Specific Self-Distillation (MSSD) module and a Model-Agnostic Causal
Inference (MACI) module. MSSD enhances robustness under the RMFM task through a
weight-sharing self-distillation approach applied across low-level features,
attention maps, and high-level representations. Additionally, a Word-level
Self-aligned Attention Module (WSAM) reduces computational complexity, while a
Multimodal Composite Transformer (MCT) facilitates efficient multimodal fusion.
To tackle OOD challenges, MACI employs a tailored causal graph to mitigate
label and language biases using a Multimodal Causal Module (MCM) and
fine-grained counterfactual texts. Notably, MACI can independently enhance OOD
generalization with minimal additional parameters. Furthermore, we also
introduce the new repartitioned MER OOD datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that CIDer achieves robust performance in both RMFM and OOD
scenarios, with fewer parameters and faster training compared to
state-of-the-art methods. The implementation of this work is publicly
accessible at https://github.com/gw-zhong/CIDer.

### [96] [Rethinking Generative Human Video Coding with Implicit Motion Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10453)
*Bolin Chen,Ru-Ling Liao,Jie Chen,Yan Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Implicit Motion Transformation (IMT) to improve Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC) by addressing limitations of explicit motion-based methods for complex human body videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional generative video codecs struggle with human body videos due to complex motion patterns, leading to distortions and inaccurate motion in reconstruction.

Method: The proposed IMT transforms compact visual features into implicit motion guidance for better reconstruction, avoiding explicit motion fields.

Result: Experiments show IMT enhances GHVC, achieving efficient compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

Conclusion: IMT effectively addresses challenges in human body video compression, outperforming explicit motion-based approaches.

Abstract: Beyond traditional hybrid-based video codec, generative video codec could
achieve promising compression performance by evolving high-dimensional signals
into compact feature representations for bitstream compactness at the encoder
side and developing explicit motion fields as intermediate supervision for
high-quality reconstruction at the decoder side. This paradigm has achieved
significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial
videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and
diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for
Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer
severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the
limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video
compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of
Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to
characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and
transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal
reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency
compression and high-fidelity synthesis.

### [97] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability for Hyperspectral Image Classification Using 3D Structure-invariant Transformation and Intermediate Feature Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10459)
*Chun Liu,Bingqian Zhu,Tao Xu,Zheng Zheng,Zheng Li,Wei Yang,Zhigang Han,Jiayao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a method to improve transferability of adversarial attacks on hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models by dividing images into blocks and applying transformations, along with a feature distancing loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but existing methods struggle with their high-dimensional nature. The goal is to enhance attack transferability for HSI models.

Method: The method divides HSI into spatial-spectral blocks, applies transformations, and uses a feature distancing loss targeting intermediate layers to disrupt true class features.

Result: Adversarial examples generated by the method show effective transferability on public HSI datasets and robustness against defenses.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully enhances adversarial attack transferability for HSI classification, addressing limitations of current approaches.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
security challenges to hyperspectral image (HSI) classification technologies
based on DNNs. In the domain of natural images, numerous transfer-based
adversarial attack methods have been studied. However, HSIs differ from natural
images due to their high-dimensional and rich spectral information. Current
research on HSI adversarial examples remains limited and faces challenges in
fully utilizing the structural and feature information of images. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a novel method to enhance the transferability
of the adversarial examples for HSI classification models. First, while keeping
the image structure unchanged, the proposed method randomly divides the image
into blocks in both spatial and spectral dimensions. Then, various
transformations are applied on a block by block basis to increase input
diversity and mitigate overfitting. Second, a feature distancing loss targeting
intermediate layers is designed, which measures the distance between the
amplified features of the original examples and the features of the adversarial
examples as the primary loss, while the output layer prediction serves as the
auxiliary loss. This guides the perturbation to disrupt the features of the
true class in adversarial examples, effectively enhancing transferability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the adversarial examples generated by
the proposed method achieve effective transferability to black-box models on
two public HSI datasets. Furthermore, the method maintains robust attack
performance even under defense strategies.

*Stone Yun,Alexander Wong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the impact of weight initialization on DNN quantization robustness and introduces GHN-QAT, a method for quantization-robust CNN initialization using Graph Hypernetworks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improving DNN quantization robustness by focusing on weight initialization, an underexplored area, to enhance model efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Study of weight initialization effects on CNNs and introduction of GHN-QAT, which uses Graph Hypernetworks to predict quantized DNN parameters.

Result: GHN-QAT improves quantized accuracy, even for 4-bit and 2-bit quantization, outperforming random initialization.

Conclusion: GHN-QAT provides a novel approach to quantized DNN design, with potential for further improvements in quantization-aware training.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been
an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model
inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as
regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness
penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern
DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial
conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight
initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating
point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods
impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study
examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN
building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that
even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer
can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new
method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks
(GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that
GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32
pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters
for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized
accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for
even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN
weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model
design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for
quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel task, medical image reasoning segmentation, is introduced to generate segmentation masks from complex medical instructions. The proposed MedSeg-R framework leverages MLLMs for reasoning and mask generation, supported by a new dataset, MedSeg-QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing models lack active reasoning for complex clinical questions and struggle with precise segmentation masks, limiting their use in automatic diagnosis.

Method: MedSeg-R combines a global context understanding module for interpreting instructions and images, and a pixel-level grounding module for generating masks.

Result: MedSeg-R outperforms benchmarks, achieving high segmentation accuracy and interpretable textual analysis.

Conclusion: MedSeg-R advances medical image segmentation by integrating reasoning and precise mask generation, supported by the MedSeg-QA dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis, yet existing
models are limited by their reliance on explicit human instructions and lack
the active reasoning capabilities to understand complex clinical questions.
While recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
improved medical question-answering (QA) tasks, most methods struggle to
generate precise segmentation masks, limiting their application in automatic
medical diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce medical image reasoning
segmentation, a novel task that aims to generate segmentation masks based on
complex and implicit medical instructions. To address this, we propose
MedSeg-R, an end-to-end framework that leverages the reasoning abilities of
MLLMs to interpret clinical questions while also capable of producing
corresponding precise segmentation masks for medical images. It is built on two
core components: 1) a global context understanding module that interprets
images and comprehends complex medical instructions to generate multi-modal
intermediate tokens, and 2) a pixel-level grounding module that decodes these
tokens to produce precise segmentation masks and textual responses.
Furthermore, we introduce MedSeg-QA, a large-scale dataset tailored for the
medical image reasoning segmentation task. It includes over 10,000 image-mask
pairs and multi-turn conversations, automatically annotated using large
language models and refined through physician reviews. Experiments show
MedSeg-R's superior performance across several benchmarks, achieving high
segmentation accuracy and enabling interpretable textual analysis of medical
images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The study evaluates four vision-language models (VLMs) for deepfake detection, finding they lack standalone reliability but show promise in augmenting human expertise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the applicability of VLMs in detecting deepfakes due to their emerging capabilities in visual reasoning.

Method: A structured zero-shot evaluation of ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok on three deepfake types using a diverse benchmark of authentic and manipulated images.

Result: VLMs produce coherent explanations and detect surface-level anomalies but are unreliable alone, with vulnerabilities to misleading patterns.

Conclusion: VLMs are not yet dependable for autonomous deepfake detection but could enhance hybrid or human-in-the-loop frameworks.

Abstract: The growing sophistication of deepfakes presents substantial challenges to
the integrity of media and the preservation of public trust. Concurrently,
vision-language models (VLMs), large language models enhanced with visual
reasoning capabilities, have emerged as promising tools across various domains,
sparking interest in their applicability to deepfake detection. This study
conducts a structured zero-shot evaluation of four prominent VLMs: ChatGPT,
Claude, Gemini, and Grok, focusing on three primary deepfake types: faceswap,
reenactment, and synthetic generation. Leveraging a meticulously assembled
benchmark comprising authentic and manipulated images from diverse sources, we
evaluate each model's classification accuracy and reasoning depth. Our analysis
indicates that while VLMs can produce coherent explanations and detect
surface-level anomalies, they are not yet dependable as standalone detection
systems. We highlight critical failure modes, such as an overemphasis on
stylistic elements and vulnerability to misleading visual patterns like vintage
aesthetics. Nevertheless, VLMs exhibit strengths in interpretability and
contextual analysis, suggesting their potential to augment human expertise in
forensic workflows. These insights imply that although general-purpose models
currently lack the reliability needed for autonomous deepfake detection, they
hold promise as integral components in hybrid or human-in-the-loop detection
frameworks.

Motivation: To provide a standardized dataset and a fine-grained evaluation metric for OMR research, enabling better comparison of methods.

Method: Creation of the SMB dataset with diverse musical textures and introduction of OMR-NED, a normalized edit distance metric for detailed error analysis.

Result: SMB and OMR-NED offer a robust framework for benchmarking OMR methods, supported by baseline experiments.

Conclusion: The work fills a gap in OMR evaluation, facilitating clearer comparisons and identification of optimal approaches.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Sheet Music Benchmark (SMB), a dataset of six
hundred and eighty-five pages specifically designed to benchmark Optical Music
Recognition (OMR) research. SMB encompasses a diverse array of musical
textures, including monophony, pianoform, quartet, and others, all encoded in
Common Western Modern Notation using the Humdrum **kern format. Alongside SMB,
we introduce the OMR Normalized Edit Distance (OMR-NED), a new metric tailored
explicitly for evaluating OMR performance. OMR-NED builds upon the widely-used
Symbol Error Rate (SER), offering a fine-grained and detailed error analysis
that covers individual musical elements such as note heads, beams, pitches,
accidentals, and other critical notation features. The resulting numeric score
provided by OMR-NED facilitates clear comparisons, enabling researchers and
end-users alike to identify optimal OMR approaches. Our work thus addresses a
long-standing gap in OMR evaluation, and we support our contributions with
baseline experiments using standardized SMB dataset splits for training and
assessing state-of-the-art methods.

*Guyang Zhang,Waleed Abdulla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to distinguish honey botanical origins, proposing a novel method (CB) to enhance CIL performance by 1-7%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate honey origin differentiation is vital for consumer protection, but collecting all honey varieties for training is impractical.

Method: Researchers compared CIL algorithms on a honey hyperspectral dataset and introduced a continual backpropagation (CB) technique to reinitialize less-used neurons.

Result: CB improved most CIL methods by 1-7%.

Conclusion: The CB method effectively enhances CIL performance for honey origin classification.

Abstract: Honey is an important commodity in the global market. Honey types of
different botanical origins provide diversified flavors and health benefits,
thus having different market values. Developing accurate and effective
botanical origin-distinguishing techniques is crucial to protect consumers'
interests. However, it is impractical to collect all the varieties of honey
products at once to train a model for botanical origin differentiation.
Therefore, researchers developed class-incremental learning (CIL) techniques to
address this challenge. This study examined and compared multiple CIL
algorithms on a real-world honey hyperspectral imaging dataset. A novel
technique is also proposed to improve the performance of class-incremental
learning algorithms by combining with a continual backpropagation (CB)
algorithm. The CB method addresses the issue of loss-of-plasticity by
reinitializing a proportion of less-used hidden neurons to inject variability
into neural networks. Experiments showed that CB improved the performance of
most CIL methods by 1-7\%.

TL;DR: The paper proposes PSLG-SAM, a two-stage framework for Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS), addressing challenges like dense annotations and complex scenes by combining coarse localization and fine segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RRSIS methods struggle with dense annotation needs and complex scene interpretation, prompting the need for a more efficient and precise solution.

Method: PSLG-SAM decomposes RRSIS into coarse localization (using a visual grounding network) and fine segmentation (guided by SAM with clustering-based foreground points and iterative mask optimization). The second stage is train-free.

Result: PSLG-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art models on datasets RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M, with significant performance improvements.

Conclusion: The framework reduces annotation burden, handles complex scenes better, and achieves superior results, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates
segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual
descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest.
Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic
segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and
complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework
named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything
Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse
localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual
grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine
segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator
and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation.
Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the
annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS
task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation,
avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality,
multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two
datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant
performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our
code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: Manual aircraft inspections are inefficient and inconsistent; J-DDL aims to automate and improve the process for better scalability and precision.

Method: Integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds, using a YOLO-based network with Fasternet blocks, EMA modules, and Inner-CIOU loss for damage detection and 3D localization.

Result: J-DDL streamlines inspections, provides comprehensive coverage, and is validated through experimental evaluations.

Conclusion: The system advances automated aircraft inspection, supported by a new public dataset for further research.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety and extended operational life of fighter aircraft
necessitates frequent and exhaustive inspections. While surface defect
detection is feasible for human inspectors, manual methods face critical
limitations in scalability, efficiency, and consistency due to the vast surface
area, structural complexity, and operational demands of aircraft maintenance.
We propose a smart surface damage detection and localization system for fighter
aircraft, termed J-DDL. J-DDL integrates 2D images and 3D point clouds of the
entire aircraft surface, captured using a combined system of laser scanners and
cameras, to achieve precise damage detection and localization. Central to our
system is a novel damage detection network built on the YOLO architecture,
specifically optimized for identifying surface defects in 2D aircraft images.
Key innovations include lightweight Fasternet blocks for efficient feature
extraction, an optimized neck architecture incorporating Efficient Multiscale
Attention (EMA) modules for superior feature aggregation, and the introduction
of a novel loss function, Inner-CIOU, to enhance detection accuracy. After
detecting damage in 2D images, the system maps the identified anomalies onto
corresponding 3D point clouds, enabling accurate 3D localization of defects
across the aircraft surface. Our J-DDL not only streamlines the inspection
process but also ensures more comprehensive and detailed coverage of large and
complex aircraft exteriors. To facilitate further advancements in this domain,
we have developed the first publicly available dataset specifically focused on
aircraft damage. Experimental evaluations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, underscoring its potential to significantly advance automated

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving
multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due
to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all
available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a
significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the
inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper
introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning
(CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring
models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to
deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we
present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical
question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we
present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by
leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval.

pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal
structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species
occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate
statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured
templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and
a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project,
showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended
ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in
human-understandable language.

### [110] [Balancing Tails when Comparing Distributions: Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI) with Application to Bias Evaluation in Operational Face Biometrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10564)
*Imanol Solano,Julian Fierrez,Aythami Morales,Alejandro Peña,Ruben Tolosana,Francisco Zamora-Martinez,Javier San Agustin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric to detect subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems by analyzing genuine and impostor score distributions separately, focusing on tail probabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing metrics fail to detect subtle demographic biases in face recognition systems, especially in the tails of score distributions.

Method: CEI analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, with a configurable focus on tail probabilities. CEI^A automates this process for objectivity and ease of use.

Result: Experiments show CEI outperforms previous methods in detecting nuanced biases, and CEI^A enhances practicality.

Conclusion: CEI is a robust and sensitive tool for fairness assessment in face recognition, with broader applicability to other problems involving tail distribution analysis.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often
eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle
disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the
Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this
limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions
separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also
considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating
state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets)
confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods
fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric
that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a
robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed
methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics
but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in
any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense visual SLAM faces challenges in real-time performance, robustness, and scalability, especially with neural implicit representations. Existing methods like ESLAM struggle with memory growth.

Method: LRSLAM employs low-rank tensor decomposition (Six-axis and CP decompositions) for improved convergence, memory efficiency, and reconstruction/localization quality.

Result: LRSLAM shows superior performance in parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets.

Conclusion: LRSLAM offers a more efficient and scalable solution for dense visual SLAM, with plans to release the code publicly.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been crucial across various
domains, including autonomous driving, mobile robotics, and mixed reality.
Dense visual SLAM, leveraging RGB-D camera systems, offers advantages but faces
challenges in achieving real-time performance, robustness, and scalability for
large-scale scenes. Recent approaches utilizing neural implicit scene
representations show promise but suffer from high computational costs and
memory requirements. ESLAM introduced a plane-based tensor decomposition but
still struggled with memory growth. Addressing these challenges, we propose a
more efficient visual SLAM model, called LRSLAM, utilizing low-rank tensor
decomposition methods. Our approach, leveraging the Six-axis and CP
decompositions, achieves better convergence rates, memory efficiency, and
reconstruction/localization quality than existing state-of-the-art approaches.
Evaluation across diverse indoor RGB-D datasets demonstrates LRSLAM's superior
performance in terms of parameter efficiency, processing time, and accuracy,
retaining reconstruction and localization quality. Our code will be publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework is proposed to generate realistic human-product demonstration videos by preserving identities and spatial relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing frameworks struggle with preserving human-product identities and understanding spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations.

Method: Uses a DiT framework with paired human-product reference info, masked cross-attention, 3D body mesh, product bounding boxes, and structured text encoding for 3D consistency.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art in identity preservation and realistic motion generation.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses challenges in human-product video generation, offering improved realism and identity integrity.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product
demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However,
most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans
and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships,
leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address
these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our
method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details,
such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference
information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We
employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise
motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product
placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate
category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational
changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data
augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques
in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and
generating realistic demonstration motions. Project page:

*Jun Wang,Lixing Zhu,Xiaohan Yu,Abhir Bhalerao,Yulan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLACE framework improves medical visual representation learning by aligning pathological-level details between images and reports without extra annotations, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and complex report structures in medical imaging by focusing on pathological-level alignment, often overlooked in prior work.

Method: Proposes Pathological-Level Cross-Modal Alignment (PCMA) and a Visual Pathology Observation Extractor to align pathology observations. Introduces a proxy task for correlation exploration among image patches.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification, retrieval, segmentation, detection, and report generation.

Conclusion: PLACE effectively enhances fine-grained medical visual representation learning, demonstrating broad applicability in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations from image-report pairs through joint
learning has garnered increasing research attention due to its potential to
alleviate the data scarcity problem in the medical domain. The primary
challenges stem from the lengthy reports that feature complex discourse
relations and semantic pathologies. Previous works have predominantly focused
on instance-wise or token-wise cross-modal alignment, often neglecting the
importance of pathological-level consistency. This paper presents a novel
framework PLACE that promotes the Pathological-Level Alignment and enriches the
fine-grained details via Correlation Exploration without additional human
annotations. Specifically, we propose a novel pathological-level cross-modal
alignment (PCMA) approach to maximize the consistency of pathology observations
from both images and reports. To facilitate this, a Visual Pathology
Observation Extractor is introduced to extract visual pathological observation
representations from localized tokens. The PCMA module operates independently
of any external disease annotations, enhancing the generalizability and
robustness of our methods. Furthermore, we design a proxy task that enforces
the model to identify correlations among image patches, thereby enriching the
fine-grained details crucial for various downstream tasks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification,
image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, object detection and report
generation.

*Qing Wang,Xiaohang Yang,Yilan Dong,Naveen Raj Govindaraj,Gregory Slabaugh,Shanxin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DanceChat uses an LLM to guide music-to-dance generation, improving diversity and alignment with music by incorporating textual motion instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The semantic gap between music and dance, along with the one-to-many mapping challenge and limited paired data, necessitates additional guidance for diverse dance generation.

Method: DanceChat combines an LLM for textual motion instructions, multi-modal feature fusion, and diffusion-based motion synthesis with alignment loss.

Result: DanceChat outperforms state-of-the-art methods on AIST++ and in human evaluations.

Conclusion: LLM-guided dance generation enhances diversity and alignment with music, addressing key challenges in the field.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to synthesize human dance motion conditioned
on musical input. Despite recent progress, significant challenges remain due to
the semantic gap between music and dance motion, as music offers only abstract
cues, such as melody, groove, and emotion, without explicitly specifying the
physical movements. Moreover, a single piece of music can produce multiple
plausible dance interpretations. This one-to-many mapping demands additional
guidance, as music alone provides limited information for generating diverse
dance movements. The challenge is further amplified by the scarcity of paired
music and dance data, which restricts the model\^a\u{A}\'Zs ability to learn
diverse dance patterns. In this paper, we introduce DanceChat, a Large Language
Model (LLM)-guided music-to-dance generation approach. We use an LLM as a
choreographer that provides textual motion instructions, offering explicit,
high-level guidance for dance generation. This approach goes beyond implicit
learning from music alone, enabling the model to generate dance that is both
more diverse and better aligned with musical styles. Our approach consists of
three components: (1) an LLM-based pseudo instruction generation module that
produces textual dance guidance based on music style and structure, (2) a
multi-modal feature extraction and fusion module that integrates music, rhythm,
and textual guidance into a shared representation, and (3) a diffusion-based
motion synthesis module together with a multi-modal alignment loss, which
ensures that the generated dance is aligned with both musical and textual cues.
Extensive experiments on AIST++ and human evaluations show that DanceChat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T2I-PAL reduces the modality gap in CLIP by generating images from text captions, enhancing multi-label recognition with heatmaps and prototypes, and combining prompt tuning and adapter learning for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The modality gap between text and image features in CLIP limits performance in tasks like multi-label recognition (MLR). T2I-PAL aims to bridge this gap without requiring fully annotated training images.

Method: T2I-PAL uses text-to-image generation models to create diverse images from text captions, employs class-wise heatmaps and learnable prototypes for robust local feature representation, and integrates prompt tuning and adapter learning.

Result: T2I-PAL improves recognition performance by 3.47% on average over state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks like MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE.

Conclusion: T2I-PAL effectively bridges the modality gap, reduces annotation workload, and seamlessly integrates with CLIP, offering significant performance gains in multi-label recognition.

Abstract: Benefited from image-text contrastive learning, pre-trained vision-language
models, e.g., CLIP, allow to direct leverage texts as images (TaI) for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While CLIP is capable of making image
features to be similar to the corresponding text features, the modality gap
remains a nontrivial issue and limits image recognition performance of TaI.
Using multi-label image recognition (MLR) as an example, we present a novel
method, called T2I-PAL to tackle the modality gap issue when using only text
captions for PEFT. The core design of T2I-PAL is to leverage pre-trained
text-to-image generation models to generate photo-realistic and diverse images
from text captions, thereby reducing the modality gap. To further enhance MLR,
T2I-PAL incorporates a class-wise heatmap and learnable prototypes. This
aggregates local similarities, making the representation of local visual
features more robust and informative for multi-label recognition. For better
PEFT, we further combine both prompt tuning and adapter learning to enhance
classification performance. T2I-PAL offers significant advantages: it
eliminates the need for fully semantically annotated training images, thereby
reducing the manual annotation workload, and it preserves the intrinsic mode of
the CLIP model, allowing for seamless integration with any existing CLIP
framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, show that our T2I-PAL can boost recognition performance
by 3.47% in average above the top-ranked state-of-the-art methods.

*Muskan Dosi,Chiranjeev Chiranjeev,Kartik Thakral,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperSphereDiff improves diffusion models for hyperspherical data by using directional noise to preserve class geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard diffusion models use isotropic Gaussian noise, which is suboptimal for non-Euclidean data like hyperspherical manifolds.

Method: Introduces HyperSphereDiff, aligning hyperspherical structures with directional noise to capture angular uncertainty.

Result: Theoretical and empirical validation shows better alignment with hyperspherical geometry, improving generative performance.

Conclusion: HyperSphereDiff enhances accuracy and geometry-awareness in generative models for hyperspherical data.

Abstract: Do contemporary diffusion models preserve the class geometry of
hyperspherical data? Standard diffusion models rely on isotropic Gaussian noise
in the forward process, inherently favoring Euclidean spaces. However, many
real-world problems involve non-Euclidean distributions, such as hyperspherical
manifolds, where class-specific patterns are governed by angular geometry
within hypercones. When modeled in Euclidean space, these angular subtleties
are lost, leading to suboptimal generative performance. To address this
limitation, we introduce HyperSphereDiff to align hyperspherical structures
with directional noise, preserving class geometry and effectively capturing
angular uncertainty. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that
this approach aligns the generative process with the intrinsic geometry of
hyperspherical data, resulting in more accurate and geometry-aware generative
models. We evaluate our framework on four object datasets and two face
datasets, showing that incorporating angular uncertainty better preserves the
underlying hyperspherical manifold. Resources are available at:

*Jihyeon Seong,Hyunkyung Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper explores the role of random masking in self-distillation (DINO framework), proposing asymmetric masking for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Random masking in self-distillation may remove critical semantic info, prompting a need for smarter masking strategies.

Method: Apply random masking only to the student's global view, keeping local views and teacher's global view unmasked.

Result: Asymmetric masking improves attention maps and downstream performance on mini-ImageNet.

Conclusion: Targeted masking in self-distillation enhances robustness and performance.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a
wide range of vision tasks. In particular, self-distillation frameworks such as
DINO have contributed significantly to these advances. Within such frameworks,
random masking is often utilized to improve training efficiency and introduce
regularization. However, recent studies have raised concerns that
indiscriminate random masking may inadvertently eliminate critical semantic
information, motivating the development of more informed masking strategies. In
this study, we explore the role of random masking in the self-distillation
setting, focusing on the DINO framework. Specifically, we apply random masking
exclusively to the student's global view, while preserving the student's local
views and the teacher's global view in their original, unmasked forms. This
design leverages DINO's multi-view augmentation scheme to retain clean
supervision while inducing robustness through masked inputs. We evaluate our
approach using DINO-Tiny on the mini-ImageNet dataset and show that random
masking under this asymmetric setup yields more robust and fine-grained
attention maps, ultimately enhancing downstream performance.

TL;DR: Proposes HEA-MM, a hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models, using structured light scanners and multi-level error analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring high quality in aviation equipment requires precise error assessment of CAD models during manufacturing.

Method: HEA-MM uses structured light scanners for 3D measurements, registers point clouds with CAD models, and performs error analysis at global, part, and feature levels. Includes optimization-based primitive refinement and a two-stage circular hole detection algorithm.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on various aircraft CAD models.

Conclusion: HEA-MM provides a robust framework for hierarchical error assessment in aviation manufacturing.

Abstract: The most essential feature of aviation equipment is high quality, including
high performance, high stability and high reliability. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical error assessment framework for aircraft CAD models
within a manufacturing-and-measurement platform, termed HEA-MM. HEA-MM employs
structured light scanners to obtain comprehensive 3D measurements of
manufactured workpieces. The measured point cloud is registered with the
reference CAD model, followed by an error analysis conducted at three
hierarchical levels: global, part, and feature. At the global level, the error
analysis evaluates the overall deviation of the scanned point cloud from the
reference CAD model. At the part level, error analysis is performed on these
patches underlying the point clouds. We propose a novel optimization-based
primitive refinement method to obtain a set of meaningful patches of point
clouds. Two basic operations, splitting and merging, are introduced to refine
the coarse primitives. At the feature level, error analysis is performed on
circular holes, which are commonly found in CAD models. To facilitate it, a
two-stage algorithm is introduced for the detection of circular holes. First,
edge points are identified using a tensor-voting algorithm. Then, multiple
circles are fitted through a hypothesize-and-clusterize framework, ensuring
accurate detection and analysis of the circular features. Experimental results
on various aircraft CAD models demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

*Xinyuan Liu,Hang Xu,Yike Ma,Yucheng Zhang,Feng Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSP (Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition) is a framework for oriented object detection in remote sensing, improving sample assignment and box extraction to outperform existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-density scenes in remote sensing require costly annotations. Existing point-supervised methods suffer from poor sample assignment and instance confusion.

Method: SSP combines rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification, using pixel-level and semantic spatial partitioning for sample assignment and box extraction.

Result: SSP achieves 45.78% mAP, surpassing PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%, and integrates well with ORCNN (47.86% mAP) and ReDet (48.50% mAP).

Conclusion: SSP effectively addresses annotation challenges in dense scenes, offering a robust solution for oriented object detection.

Abstract: Recent remote sensing tech advancements drive imagery growth, making oriented
object detection rapid development, yet hindered by labor-intensive annotation
for high-density scenes. Oriented object detection with point supervision
offers a cost-effective solution for densely packed scenes in remote sensing,
yet existing methods suffer from inadequate sample assignment and instance
confusion due to rigid rule-based designs. To address this, we propose SSP
(Semantic-decoupled Spatial Partition), a unified framework that synergizes
rule-driven prior injection and data-driven label purification. Specifically,
SSP introduces two core innovations: 1) Pixel-level Spatial Partition-based
Sample Assignment, which compactly estimates the upper and lower bounds of
object scales and mines high-quality positive samples and hard negative samples
through spatial partitioning of pixel maps. 2) Semantic Spatial Partition-based
Box Extraction, which derives instances from spatial partitions modulated by
semantic maps and reliably converts them into bounding boxes to form
pseudo-labels for supervising the learning of downstream detectors. Experiments
on DOTA-v1.0 and others demonstrate SSP\' s superiority: it achieves 45.78% mAP
under point supervision, outperforming SOTA method PointOBB-v2 by 4.10%.
Furthermore, when integrated with ORCNN and ReDet architectures, the SSP
framework achieves mAP values of 47.86% and 48.50%, respectively. The code is

*Eshan Ramesh,Nishio Takayuki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LatentCSI uses WiFi CSI measurements and a latent diffusion model (LDM) to generate high-quality images efficiently, outperforming traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To simplify and improve image generation from WiFi CSI data by leveraging LDMs, avoiding complex techniques like GANs.

Method: A lightweight neural network maps CSI amplitudes into an LDM's latent space, followed by denoising diffusion and text-guided decoding.

Result: LatentCSI outperforms baselines in efficiency and quality, with added text-guided controllability.

Conclusion: LatentCSI offers a practical, efficient, and high-quality solution for WiFi CSI-based image generation.

Abstract: We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical
environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent
diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and
computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a
lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space
of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent
representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's
pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the
challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image
encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines,
enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach
on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi
devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The
results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable
complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational
efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical
advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.

TL;DR: MSTAR introduces a box-free scene text retrieval method with progressive vision embedding and multi-instance matching, outperforming state-of-the-art models while eliminating costly bounding box annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scene text retrieval methods rely on expensive bounding box annotations and struggle with diverse query types.

Method: MSTAR uses progressive vision embedding for multi-grained text representation and harmonizes free-style queries with style-aware instructions, enhanced by a multi-instance matching module.

Result: MSTAR surpasses previous models by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text and by 8.5% on the new MQTR benchmark.

Conclusion: MSTAR is a superior, cost-effective solution for multi-query scene text retrieval, validated by extensive experiments and a new benchmark.

Abstract: Scene text retrieval has made significant progress with the assistance of
accurate text localization. However, existing approaches typically require
costly bounding box annotations for training. Besides, they mostly adopt a
customized retrieval strategy but struggle to unify various types of queries to
meet diverse retrieval needs. To address these issues, we introduce Muti-query
Scene Text retrieval with Attention Recycling (MSTAR), a box-free approach for
scene text retrieval. It incorporates progressive vision embedding to
dynamically capture the multi-grained representation of texts and harmonizes
free-style text queries with style-aware instructions. Additionally, a
multi-instance matching module is integrated to enhance vision-language
alignment. Furthermore, we build the Multi-Query Text Retrieval (MQTR) dataset,
the first benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-query scene text retrieval
capability of models, comprising four query types and 16k images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method across seven public
datasets and the MQTR dataset. Notably, MSTAR marginally surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art model by 6.4% in MAP on Total-Text while eliminating box
annotation costs. Moreover, on the MQTR benchmark, MSTAR significantly
outperforms the previous models by an average of 8.5%. The code and datasets

*Suin Lee,Dae-Shik Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexTailor improves texture synthesis from text by integrating resampling and adaptive camera positioning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-texture methods suffer from texture inconsistency due to insufficient integration of synthesized textures and fixed camera positions.

Method: TexTailor uses resampling to integrate past textures and adapts camera positions based on object geometry, with a performance preservation loss.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on Objaverse and ShapeNet datasets in view-consistent texture synthesis.

Conclusion: TexTailor effectively addresses texture inconsistency and improves synthesis quality.

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object
textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis
approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate
images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However,
these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across
viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized
textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the
autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the
predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the
object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized
from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In
TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that
repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within
the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on
these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a
few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate
high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an
performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve
the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera
positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the
Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

TL;DR: The paper addresses the underperformance of text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models in medical imaging, proposing a fine-tuning framework to improve alignment between radiology reports and chest X-rays, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent Diffusion Models excel in text-guided image synthesis but are underexplored in medical imaging due to data limitations. This work aims to improve their alignment with clinical text for better downstream task performance.

Method: The authors propose a fine-tuning framework for pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models to enhance multi-modal alignment between radiology reports and chest X-rays, focusing on phrase grounding.

Result: The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MS-CXR benchmark and shows robustness on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR).

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively improves alignment in medical imaging, enabling better downstream task performance, with code to be made publicly available.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models have shown remarkable results in text-guided image
synthesis in recent years. In the domain of natural (RGB) images, recent works
have shown that such models can be adapted to various vision-language
downstream tasks with little to no supervision involved. On the contrary,
text-to-image Latent Diffusion Models remain relatively underexplored in the
field of medical imaging, primarily due to limited data availability (e.g., due
to privacy concerns). In this work, focusing on the chest X-ray modality, we
first demonstrate that a standard text-conditioned Latent Diffusion Model has
not learned to align clinically relevant information in free-text radiology
reports with the corresponding areas of the given scan. Then, to alleviate this
issue, we propose a fine-tuning framework to improve multi-modal alignment in a
pre-trained model such that it can be efficiently repurposed for downstream
tasks such as phrase grounding. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on a
standard benchmark dataset (MS-CXR), while also exhibiting robust performance
on out-of-distribution data (VinDr-CXR). Our code will be made publicly
available.

SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring
bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative
diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic
information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving
semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification
without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict
one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible
conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels.
Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves
state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores
of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps.
Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and
shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GigaVideo-1 is an efficient fine-tuning framework for video diffusion models, improving generation quality without human supervision or extra data, achieving a 4% average gain on VBench-2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fine-tuning methods for video diffusion models rely on human annotations and high computational costs, limiting practicality. GigaVideo-1 aims to address this by leveraging automatic feedback.

Method: GigaVideo-1 uses a prompt-driven data engine for diverse training samples and a reward-guided training strategy with pre-trained vision-language models for optimization.

Result: GigaVideo-1 improves performance on 17 VBench-2.0 dimensions by ~4% using only 4 GPU-hours, without manual annotations or extra real data.

Conclusion: GigaVideo-1 is an effective and efficient solution for fine-tuning video diffusion models, requiring minimal resources and no human supervision.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion models has greatly enhanced video generation
quality, yet these models still require fine-tuning to improve specific
dimensions like instance preservation, motion rationality, composition, and
physical plausibility. Existing fine-tuning approaches often rely on human
annotations and large-scale computational resources, limiting their
practicality. In this work, we propose GigaVideo-1, an efficient fine-tuning
framework that advances video generation without additional human supervision.
Rather than injecting large volumes of high-quality data from external sources,
GigaVideo-1 unlocks the latent potential of pre-trained video diffusion models
through automatic feedback. Specifically, we focus on two key aspects of the
fine-tuning process: data and optimization. To improve fine-tuning data, we
design a prompt-driven data engine that constructs diverse, weakness-oriented
training samples. On the optimization side, we introduce a reward-guided
training strategy, which adaptively weights samples using feedback from
pre-trained vision-language models with a realism constraint. We evaluate
GigaVideo-1 on the VBench-2.0 benchmark using Wan2.1 as the baseline across 17
evaluation dimensions. Experiments show that GigaVideo-1 consistently improves
performance on almost all the dimensions with an average gain of about 4% using
only 4 GPU-hours. Requiring no manual annotations and minimal real data,
GigaVideo-1 demonstrates both effectiveness and efficiency. Code, model, and
data will be publicly available.

*Marzieh Oghbaie,Teresa Araújoa,Hrvoje Bogunović*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PiPViT is an interpretable prototypical model for medical imaging that learns human-understandable prototypes using vision transformers and contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing prototype-based methods lack consistency with human-understandable biomarkers and often produce overly granular prototypes in medical imaging.

Method: PiPViT uses a vision transformer (ViT) to capture long-range dependencies, contrastive learning, and multi-resolution processing to learn interpretable prototypes.

Result: PiPViT achieved competitive performance on retinal OCT classification and produced clinically relevant prototypes.

Conclusion: PiPViT provides transparent explanations for diagnostic outcomes, aiding clinicians in understanding decisions.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by
learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the
input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable
biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn
extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging,
where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual
Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for
image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures
long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable
prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels.
Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution
input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across
scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four
datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations.
Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the
learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT
can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding
diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

*Subhram Dasgupta,Janelle Mason,Xiaohong Yuan,Olusola Odeyomi,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CNN with SE block attention is proposed for efficient deepfake detection, achieving high accuracy with minimal computational resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes challenge information authenticity; existing detection models are resource-heavy.

Method: Uses a lightweight CNN with SE block for dynamic feature recalibration, integrated into a sequential model.

Result: Achieved 94.14% accuracy and 0.985 AUC-ROC on Style GAN dataset.

Conclusion: The model offers an efficient, scalable solution for deepfake detection with low resource usage.

Abstract: In the digital age, Deepfake present a formidable challenge by using advanced
artificial intelligence to create highly convincing manipulated content,
undermining information authenticity and security. These sophisticated
fabrications surpass traditional detection methods in complexity and realism.
To address this issue, we aim to harness cutting-edge deep learning
methodologies to engineer an innovative deepfake detection model. However, most
of the models designed for deepfake detection are large, causing heavy storage
and memory consumption. In this research, we propose a lightweight convolution
neural network (CNN) with squeeze and excitation block attention (SE) for
Deepfake detection. The SE block module is designed to perform dynamic
channel-wise feature recalibration. The SE block allows the network to
emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones, which leads to a
more efficient and effective learning module. This module is integrated with a
simple sequential model to perform Deepfake detection. The model is smaller in
size and it achieves competing accuracy with the existing models for deepfake
detection tasks. The model achieved an overall classification accuracy of
94.14% and AUC-ROC score of 0.985 on the Style GAN dataset from the Diverse
Fake Face Dataset. Our proposed approach presents a promising avenue for
combating the Deepfake challenge with minimal computational resources,
developing efficient and scalable solutions for digital content verification.

*Xia Du,Xiaoyuan Liu,Jizhe Zhou,Zheng Lin,Chi-man Pun,Zhe Chen,Wei Ni,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UAC, a framework for generating adversarial CAPTCHAs using text prompts and LLMs, improving diversity and attack effectiveness. BP-UAC is proposed for black-box attacks, achieving high success rates while maintaining human readability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CAPTCHAs are vulnerable to DNN-based attacks, and existing adversarial methods often distort images or lack applicability without initial inputs. UAC addresses these issues by leveraging text prompts and LLMs.

Method: UAC uses LLMs to guide adversarial CAPTCHA generation. For targeted attacks, EDICT optimizes diffusion model latent variables. For untargeted black-box attacks, BP-UAC employs multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization.

Result: BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across systems, producing CAPTCHAs that fool DNNs while remaining natural to humans.

Conclusion: UAC and BP-UAC offer robust adversarial CAPTCHA solutions, enhancing security against automated attacks without compromising human usability.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are
increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks
(DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image
characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and
limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these
challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel
framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by
attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC
enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks.
For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a
diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially
for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA
(BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and
bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC
achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural
CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate automatic screening of minors in unconstrained images demands models
that are robust to distribution shift and resilient to the children
under-representation in publicly available data. To overcome these issues, we
propose a multi-task architecture with dedicated under/over-age discrimination
tasks based on a frozen FaRL vision-language backbone joined with a compact
two-layer MLP that shares features across one age-regression head and four
binary under-age heads for age thresholds of 12, 15, 18, and 21 years, focusing
on the legally critical age range. To address the severe class imbalance, we
introduce an $\alpha$-reweighted focal-style loss and age-balanced mini-batch
sampling, which equalizes twelve age bins during stochastic optimization.
Further improvement is achieved with an age gap that removes edge cases from
the loss.
  Moreover, we set a rigorous evaluation by proposing the Overall Under-Age
Benchmark, with 303k cleaned training images and 110k test images, defining
both the "ASORES-39k" restricted overall test, which removes the noisiest
domains, and the age estimation wild shifts test "ASWIFT-20k" of 20k-images,
stressing extreme pose ($>$45{\deg}), expression, and low image quality to
emulate real-world shifts.
  Trained on the cleaned overall set with resampling and age gap, our multiage
model "F" lowers the root-mean-square-error on the ASORES-39k restricted test
from 5.733 (age-only baseline) to 5.656 years and lifts under-18 detection from
F2 score of 0.801 to 0.857 at 1% false-adult rate. Under the domain shift to
the wild data of ASWIFT-20k, the same configuration nearly sustains 0.99 recall
while boosting F2 from 0.742 to 0.833 with respect to the age-only baseline,
demonstrating strong generalization under distribution shift. For the under-12
and under-15 tasks, the respective boosts in F2 are from 0.666 to 0.955 and
from 0.689 to 0.916, respectively.

*Melika Ayoughi,Mina Ghadimi Atigh,Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani,Cees G. M. Snoek,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm for hierarchical data, addressing the simultaneous learning of instances and classes in real-world applications like robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world applications require models to handle both instance and class learning simultaneously, which existing continual learning methods do not address.

Method: Proposes HyperCLIC, leveraging hyperbolic space for hierarchical data, with hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives.

Result: HyperCLIC shows improved hierarchical generalization on the EgoObjects dataset.

Conclusion: HyperCLIC effectively handles hierarchical continual learning, balancing instance recognition and class generalization.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances
or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving
cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life
scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and
classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple
levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance
recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we
identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To
model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual
learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited
for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with
low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic
classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of
hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities,
we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on
EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical
object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show
that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved
hierarchical generalization.

*Yuqi Shen,Fengyang Xiao,Sujie Hu,Youwei Pang,Yifan Pu,Chengyu Fang,Xiu Li,Chunming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces UMBD, a generative refinement framework for Camouflaged Object Detection (COD), using uncertainty-guided masking and Bernoulli diffusion to improve segmentation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing COD methods lack effective post-processing refinement, leaving room for improvement in segmentation accuracy.

Method: Proposes UMBD with an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism and HUQNet for uncertainty quantification, integrating with existing COD models.

Result: Achieves average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure across COD benchmarks.

Conclusion: UMBD effectively enhances COD performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a versatile refinement solution.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) presents inherent challenges due to the
subtle visual differences between targets and their backgrounds. While existing
methods have made notable progress, there remains significant potential for
post-processing refinement that has yet to be fully explored. To address this
limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-Masked Bernoulli Diffusion (UMBD) model,
the first generative refinement framework specifically designed for COD. UMBD
introduces an uncertainty-guided masking mechanism that selectively applies
Bernoulli diffusion to residual regions with poor segmentation quality,
enabling targeted refinement while preserving correctly segmented areas. To
support this process, we design the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification Network
(HUQNet), which employs a multi-branch architecture and fuses uncertainty from
multiple sources to improve estimation accuracy. This enables adaptive guidance
during the generative sampling process. The proposed UMBD framework can be
seamlessly integrated with a wide range of existing Encoder-Decoder-based COD
models, combining their discriminative capabilities with the generative
advantages of diffusion-based refinement. Extensive experiments across multiple
COD benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance improvements, achieving
average gains of 5.5% in MAE and 3.2% in weighted F-measure with only modest
computational overhead. Code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a deep-learning method to generate synthetic golden standards for defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing, outperforming traditional approaches and improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing is labor-intensive due to the lack of golden standards. The work aims to automate this process using synthetic data.

Method: A Deep Neural Network is trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data, evaluated on synthetic and real wafer images.

Result: The deep-learning method outperforms a baseline decision-tree approach, enabling efficient defect detection using simulated golden standards.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances defect detection in InP wafer manufacturing by leveraging synthetic golden standards, demonstrating practical utility in template matching.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template
matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project
wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to
such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn,
is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing
a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural
Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data.
We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated
images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our
deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach,
enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined
region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a
template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface
defect detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQE-CLIP improves zero- and few-shot anomaly detection in medical tasks by integrating textual and visual information with learnable prompts and instance-aware queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CLIP-based methods assume prior category knowledge and lack effectiveness in distinguishing anomalies in joint embedding space, especially in medical domains.

Method: Proposes IQE-CLIP with class-based and learnable prompting tokens, and an instance-aware query module for anomaly-sensitive embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on six medical datasets in zero- and few-shot settings.

Conclusion: IQE-CLIP addresses limitations of existing methods and excels in medical anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models, such as CLIP, have significantly
improved performance in zero- and few-shot anomaly detection (ZFSAD) tasks.
However, most existing CLIP-based methods assume prior knowledge of categories
and rely on carefully designed prompts tailored to specific scenarios. While
these text prompts capture semantic information in the textual space, they
often fail to distinguish normal and anomalous instances in the joint embedding
space. Moreover, most ZFSAD approaches focus on industrial domains, with
limited exploration in medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
IQE-CLIP, a novel framework for ZFSAD in the medical domain. We show that query
embeddings integrating both textual and instance-aware visual information serve
as more effective indicators of anomalies. Specifically, we introduce
class-based and learnable prompting tokens to better adapt CLIP to the medical
setting. Furthermore, we design an instance-aware query module that extracts
region-level contextual information from both modalities, enabling the
generation of anomaly-sensitive embeddings. Extensive experiments on six
medical datasets demonstrate that IQE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Code and data are

TL;DR: PosterCraft is a unified framework for generating aesthetic posters, outperforming baselines in accuracy, layout coherence, and visual appeal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating aesthetic posters requires seamless integration of text, artistic content, and layout, which existing modular pipelines fail to address.

Method: PosterCraft uses a cascaded workflow: text-rendering optimization, region-aware fine-tuning, aesthetic-text reinforcement learning, and joint vision-language feedback refinement.

Result: PosterCraft outperforms baselines in rendering accuracy, layout coherence, and visual appeal, nearing SOTA commercial systems.

Conclusion: PosterCraft offers a robust, automated solution for high-quality poster generation, with open-sourced code and datasets.

Abstract: Generating aesthetic posters is more challenging than simple design images:
it requires not only precise text rendering but also the seamless integration
of abstract artistic content, striking layouts, and overall stylistic harmony.
To address this, we propose PosterCraft, a unified framework that abandons
prior modular pipelines and rigid, predefined layouts, allowing the model to
freely explore coherent, visually compelling compositions. PosterCraft employs
a carefully designed, cascaded workflow to optimize the generation of
high-aesthetic posters: (i) large-scale text-rendering optimization on our
newly introduced Text-Render-2M dataset; (ii) region-aware supervised
fine-tuning on HQ-Poster100K; (iii) aesthetic-text-reinforcement learning via
best-of-n preference optimization; and (iv) joint vision-language feedback
refinement. Each stage is supported by a fully automated data-construction
pipeline tailored to its specific needs, enabling robust training without
complex architectural modifications. Evaluated on multiple experiments,
PosterCraft significantly outperforms open-source baselines in rendering
accuracy, layout coherence, and overall visual appeal-approaching the quality
of SOTA commercial systems. Our code, models, and datasets can be found in the

TL;DR: Proposes Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA) for ultra-large image upsampling, addressing performance decline in prior ASISR methods by decomposing images into vector strokes and restoring details iteratively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior ASISR methods struggle with performance decline and blurring when upsampling beyond training data ranges.

Method: SbCA uses a stroke vector amplifier to decompose images into vector strokes and a detail completion module for high-fidelity reconstruction, iteratively refining details.

Result: Outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling (e.g., ×100), eliminating artifacts and blurring.

Conclusion: SbCA delivers superior visual quality and addresses distribution drift, making it effective for high-resolution image reconstruction.

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience
a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range
covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this
issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for
ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier,
which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector
graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores
missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic
strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with
this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales
within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution
drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing
high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations
on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks
(e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art
techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gaps in integrating physical knowledge and validating adaptability in dynamic scenarios, especially involving fluids and objects.

Method: SlotPi combines a Hamiltonian-based physical module with a spatio-temporal prediction module.

Result: Strong performance in prediction and VQA tasks across benchmark and fluid datasets, with adaptability demonstrated.

Conclusion: SlotPi's robustness and adaptability pave the way for advanced world models in dynamic reasoning.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through
visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses
significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods,
which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two
critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans
gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to
accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model
adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those
involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object
interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these
gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric
reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian
principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting.
Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and
Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore,
we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid
dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's
capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores
its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world
models.

Motivation: Overcome limitations of conventional image-based controllers, such as motion blur and latency, by leveraging event cameras' asynchronous nature.

Method: Integrates event-based perception, range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, with an initial imitation learning phase.

Result: Achieves robust navigation, pedestrian following, and obstacle avoidance in simulated environments.

Conclusion: The framework shows promise for adaptive, real-time navigation using event cameras and reinforcement learning.

Abstract: This work introduces a robot navigation controller that combines event
cameras and other sensors with reinforcement learning to enable real-time
human-centered navigation and obstacle avoidance. Unlike conventional

blur and latency, this approach leverages the asynchronous nature of event
cameras to process visual information over flexible time intervals, enabling
adaptive inference and control. The framework integrates event-based
perception, additional range sensing, and policy optimization via Deep

improve sample efficiency. Promising results are achieved in simulated

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for flexible, user-controllable video summarization tools without domain-specific training data, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Method: Pipeline includes video segmentation, scene-level description generation via VidLM, LLM-judged importance scoring, and score propagation using consistency and uniqueness metrics.

Result: Surpasses unsupervised methods on SumMe and TVSum; competitive on QFVS benchmark. Introduces VidSum-Reason dataset for further research.

Conclusion: Pretrained multimodal models, with principled prompting and score propagation, enable universal, text-queryable video summarization.

Abstract: The explosive growth of video data intensified the need for flexible
user-controllable summarization tools that can operate without domain-specific
training data. Existing methods either rely on datasets, limiting
generalization, or cannot incorporate user intent expressed in natural
language. We introduce Prompts-to-Summaries: the first zero-shot,
text-queryable video summarizer that converts off-the-shelf video-language
models (VidLMs) captions into user-guided skims via large language models
(LLMs) judging, without the use of training data at all, beating all
unsupervised and matching supervised methods. Our pipeline (i) segments raw
video footage into coherent scenes, (ii) generates rich scene-level
descriptions through a memory-efficient, batch-style VidLM prompting scheme
that scales to hours-long videos on a single GPU, (iii) leverages an LLM as a
judge to assign scene-level importance scores under a carefully crafted prompt,
and finally, (iv) propagates those scores to short segments level via two new
metrics: consistency (temporal coherency) and uniqueness (novelty), yielding
fine-grained frame importance. On SumMe and TVSum, our data-free approach
surpasses all prior data-hungry unsupervised methods. It also performs
competitively on the Query-Focused Video Summarization (QFVS) benchmark,
despite using no training data and the competing methods requiring supervised
frame-level importance. To spur further research, we release VidSum-Reason, a
new query-driven dataset featuring long-tailed concepts and multi-step
reasoning; our framework attains robust F1 scores and serves as the first
challenging baseline. Overall, our results demonstrate that pretrained
multimodal models, when orchestrated with principled prompting and score
propagation, already provide a powerful foundation for universal,
text-queryable video summarization.

TL;DR: SmoothProper is a neural module for deformable image registration (DIR) that enforces smoothness and message passing, addressing challenges like sparse features and large displacements in unsupervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsupervised DIR methods struggle with images containing sparse features (e.g., retinal vessels) due to unconstrained deformation fields post-training. SmoothProper aims to solve this by integrating smoothness and structural consistency.

Method: SmoothProper integrates a duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms to propagate flow signals, enforce smoothness, and preserve structure. It is model-agnostic and requires no hyperparameter tuning.

Result: On a retinal vessel dataset, SmoothProper reduces registration error to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, effectively addressing aperture and large-displacement challenges.

Conclusion: SmoothProper is the first unsupervised DIR method to handle sparse features and large displacements efficiently, offering a plug-and-play solution for existing frameworks.

Abstract: Learning-based deformable image registration (DIR) accelerates alignment by
amortizing traditional optimization via neural networks. Label supervision
further enhances accuracy, enabling efficient and precise nonlinear alignment
of unseen scans. However, images with sparse features amid large smooth
regions, such as retinal vessels, introduce aperture and large-displacement
challenges that unsupervised DIR methods struggle to address. This limitation
occurs because neural networks predict deformation fields in a single forward
pass, leaving fields unconstrained post-training and shifting the
regularization burden entirely to network weights. To address these issues, we
introduce SmoothProper, a plug-and-play neural module enforcing smoothness and
promoting message passing within the network's forward pass. By integrating a
duality-based optimization layer with tailored interaction terms, SmoothProper
efficiently propagates flow signals across spatial locations, enforces
smoothness, and preserves structural consistency. It is model-agnostic,
seamlessly integrates into existing registration frameworks with minimal
parameter overhead, and eliminates regularizer hyperparameter tuning.
Preliminary results on a retinal vessel dataset exhibiting aperture and
large-displacement challenges demonstrate our method reduces registration error
to 1.88 pixels on 2912x2912 images, marking the first unsupervised DIR approach
to effectively address both challenges. The source code will be available at

*Hui Yang,Wei Sun,Jian Liu,Jin Zheng,Jian Xiao,Ajmal Mian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOMAE is an occlusion-aware method for hand-object pose estimation using masked autoencoders, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods lack global structural perception, limiting effectiveness in occluded hand-object interactions.

Method: Proposes a target-focused masking strategy and integrates multi-scale features to predict SDF, combining it with point clouds for robust occlusion handling.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks.

Conclusion: HOMAE effectively addresses occlusion challenges in hand-object pose estimation and will release code and model.

Abstract: Hand-object pose estimation from monocular RGB images remains a significant
challenge mainly due to the severe occlusions inherent in hand-object
interactions. Existing methods do not sufficiently explore global structural
perception and reasoning, which limits their effectiveness in handling occluded
hand-object interactions. To address this challenge, we propose an
occlusion-aware hand-object pose estimation method based on masked
autoencoders, termed as HOMAE. Specifically, we propose a target-focused
masking strategy that imposes structured occlusion on regions of hand-object
interaction, encouraging the model to learn context-aware features and reason
about the occluded structures. We further integrate multi-scale features
extracted from the decoder to predict a signed distance field (SDF), capturing
both global context and fine-grained geometry. To enhance geometric perception,
we combine the implicit SDF with an explicit point cloud derived from the SDF,
leveraging the complementary strengths of both representations. This fusion
enables more robust handling of occluded regions by combining the global
context from the SDF with the precise local geometry provided by the point
cloud. Extensive experiments on challenging DexYCB and HO3Dv2 benchmarks
demonstrate that HOMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand-object
pose estimation. We will release our code and model.

*Huaying Yuan,Zheng Liu,Junjie Zhou,Ji-Rong Wen,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoDeepResearch, a text-only agentic framework with modular tools, outperforms MLLMs in long video understanding tasks without needing extended context windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenges the assumption that long video understanding requires MLLMs with extended context windows and strong visual perception.

Method: Uses a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) with a modular multi-modal toolkit (retrievers, perceivers) to selectively access and utilize video content.

Result: Achieves SOTA improvements of 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU, LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively.

Conclusion: Agentic systems like VideoDeepResearch can effectively address LVU challenges without relying on complex MLLMs.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity
and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks
requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual
perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we
challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic
framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a
text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal
toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which
are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a
problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and
utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive
experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench.
Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial
improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and
LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic
systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

### [142] [Post-Training Quantization for Video Matting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10840)
*Tianrui Zhu,Houyuan Chen,Ruihao Gong,Michele Magno,Haotong Qin,Kai Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper proposes a novel Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) framework for video matting, addressing accuracy and temporal coherence challenges with a two-stage strategy, global affine calibration, and optical flow assistance, achieving near full-precision performance even at 4-bit quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video matting is computationally intensive, and deploying it on resource-constrained devices is challenging. Existing PTQ methods for video matting are nascent and struggle with accuracy and temporal coherence.

Method: The paper introduces a two-stage PTQ strategy: block-reconstruction-based optimization for initial quantization and global calibration. It also includes a Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method and Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) to enhance temporal coherence and accuracy.

Result: PTQ4VM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across bit-widths, with 4-bit quantization performing close to full-precision models while reducing FLOPs by 8x. GAC reduces errors by up to 20%.

Conclusion: The proposed PTQ framework effectively addresses challenges in video matting quantization, offering high accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual
reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on
resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key
technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach,
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video
matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal
coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general
PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the
best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our
contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines
block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization
and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization
parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine
Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative
statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer
effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks
up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages
temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing
the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and
ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit
quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our
PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different
bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the
4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart
while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

TL;DR: VRBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-step reasoning in large models using long narrative videos, human-labeled QA pairs, and a multi-phase evaluation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluations lack focus on temporal reasoning and procedural validity, which VRBench addresses.

Method: VRBench includes 1,010 long videos, 9,468 QA pairs, and 30,292 reasoning steps. It uses a human-AI framework for coherent reasoning chains and a multi-phase evaluation pipeline.

Result: Evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench provide insights into multi-step reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: VRBench advances the field by offering a comprehensive tool for assessing multi-step reasoning in large models.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for
evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing
limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and
procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration
of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering
pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via
a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to
prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that
generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally
grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit
inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses
models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the
final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to
evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions
comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on
VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that
advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

*Zhao Zhang,Yutao Cheng,Dexiang Hong,Maoke Yang,Gonglei Shi,Lei Ma,Hui Zhang,Jie Shao,Xinglong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CreatiPoster is a framework for generating editable, multi-layer graphic designs from natural-language instructions or assets, outperforming existing tools and releasing a large copyright-free dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tools for graphic design lack accuracy in incorporating user assets, maintaining editability, and achieving professional appeal, prompting the need for a better solution.

Method: CreatiPoster uses a protocol model (RGBA large multimodal model) to generate a JSON specification for layers and a conditional background model to synthesize coherent backgrounds.

Result: CreatiPoster surpasses open-source and commercial systems in generating professional designs and includes a benchmark with automated metrics.

Conclusion: The framework advances AI-assisted graphic design, supporting diverse applications and democratizing access to high-quality design tools.

Abstract: Graphic design plays a crucial role in both commercial and personal contexts,
yet creating high-quality, editable, and aesthetically pleasing graphic
compositions remains a time-consuming and skill-intensive task, especially for
beginners. Current AI tools automate parts of the workflow, but struggle to
accurately incorporate user-supplied assets, maintain editability, and achieve
professional visual appeal. Commercial systems, like Canva Magic Design, rely
on vast template libraries, which are impractical for replicate. In this paper,
we introduce CreatiPoster, a framework that generates editable, multi-layer
compositions from optional natural-language instructions or assets. A protocol
model, an RGBA large multimodal model, first produces a JSON specification
detailing every layer (text or asset) with precise layout, hierarchy, content
and style, plus a concise background prompt. A conditional background model
then synthesizes a coherent background conditioned on this rendered foreground
layers. We construct a benchmark with automated metrics for graphic-design
generation and show that CreatiPoster surpasses leading open-source approaches
and proprietary commercial systems. To catalyze further research, we release a
copyright-free corpus of 100,000 multi-layer designs. CreatiPoster supports
diverse applications such as canvas editing, text overlay, responsive resizing,
multilingual adaptation, and animated posters, advancing the democratization of
AI-assisted graphic design. Project homepage:

### [145] [AIR: Zero-shot Generative Model Adaptation with Iterative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10895)
*Guimeng Liu,Milad Abdollahzadeh,Ngai-Man Cheung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) to improve zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) by addressing offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ZSGM methods assume perfect alignment between image and text offsets in CLIP space, leading to degraded image quality. The study aims to analyze and mitigate this misalignment.

Method: The authors empirically study offset misalignment in CLIP space, finding it correlates with concept distance. They propose AIR, an iterative refinement approach to improve target domain image quality.

Result: AIR outperforms existing methods in 26 setups, demonstrating superior performance through qualitative, quantitative, and user studies.

Conclusion: AIR addresses the limitations of current ZSGM methods by leveraging insights on offset misalignment, achieving SOTA results in zero-shot generative model adaptation.

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained
generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples
from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss
which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text
offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is
similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of
words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the
offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM
methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between
image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality
degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by
the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform
an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image
offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets.
Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is
correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset
misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our
second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR)
which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image
quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative,
quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate
the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are
in Supp.

*Jiancheng Huang,Gengwei Zhang,Zequn Jie,Siyu Jiao,Yinlong Qian,Ling Chen,Yunchao Wei,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M4V introduces a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for efficient text-to-video generation, reducing FLOPs by 45% and improving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the computational inefficiency of Transformers in spatiotemporal modeling for video generation.

Method: Proposes a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block for seamless multi-modal integration and spatiotemporal modeling.

Result: Achieves 45% FLOPs reduction and enhanced visual realism in video generation.

Conclusion: M4V offers a computationally efficient and high-quality solution for text-to-video generation.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and
holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling
the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly
when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence
processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in
linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a
more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct
applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To
address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for
text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion
Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal
information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token
re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45%
compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at
768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality
degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a
reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism.
Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to
produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs.

TL;DR: A scalable method for in-context image editing learns directly from videos using a block-causal diffusion transformer, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on task-specific pipelines and expert models, limiting scalability and flexibility.

Method: Uses videos to annotate interleaved multimodal sequences and trains a block-causal diffusion transformer on three proxy tasks.

Result: Demonstrates strong in-context editing capabilities and state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.

Conclusion: The model shows promise for multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing, despite being trained only on videos.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence
comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically
depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and
inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an
in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We
introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal
sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal
diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction,
current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction.
Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance
research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves
state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite
being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities
in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpectralAR introduces a causality-aware autoregressive visual generation framework using spectral tokens for efficient and detailed image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the contradiction between parallel image patches and the causal nature of autoregressive modeling by leveraging spectral perspectives.

Method: Transform images into ordered spectral tokens (Nested Spectral Tokenization) and perform autoregressive generation from lower to higher frequency components.

Result: Achieves 3.02 gFID with 64 tokens and 310M parameters on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and generation.

Conclusion: SpectralAR successfully combines causality and efficiency in autoregressive visual generation, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its
scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion
models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for
autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel,
contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we
propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework,
which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective.
Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with
Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency
components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels
of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token
efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on
ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and
SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces knowledge image generation as a new task and the MMMG benchmark to evaluate image generation models' reasoning capabilities. It highlights challenges in generating knowledge images and proposes a unified KG representation for evaluation. A new metric, MMMG-Score, is introduced, and evaluations reveal significant reasoning deficits in current models. The paper also releases a baseline model, FLUX-Reason, to encourage progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge images are vital for human learning, but generating them requires complex multimodal reasoning. Current image generation models lack the capability to produce such images effectively, necessitating a benchmark to evaluate and improve their reasoning abilities.

Method: The paper introduces the MMMG benchmark with 4,456 expert-validated image-prompt pairs across 10 disciplines and 6 educational levels. It uses a unified KG representation for evaluation and proposes MMMG-Score, combining factual fidelity (graph-edit distance) and visual clarity.

Result: Evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art models reveal poor reasoning capabilities, with GPT-4o scoring only 50.20 on MMMG-Score. The baseline model, FLUX-Reason, achieves a score of 34.45.

Conclusion: The MMMG benchmark exposes the limitations of current image generation models in reasoning tasks. The release of FLUX-Reason aims to drive further research and improvements in knowledge image generation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce knowledge image generation as a new task,
alongside the Massive Multi-Discipline Multi-Tier Knowledge-Image Generation
Benchmark (MMMG) to probe the reasoning capability of image generation models.
Knowledge images have been central to human civilization and to the mechanisms
of human learning--a fact underscored by dual-coding theory and the
picture-superiority effect. Generating such images is challenging, demanding
multimodal reasoning that fuses world knowledge with pixel-level grounding into
clear explanatory visuals. To enable comprehensive evaluation, MMMG offers
4,456 expert-validated (knowledge) image-prompt pairs spanning 10 disciplines,
6 educational levels, and diverse knowledge formats such as charts, diagrams,
and mind maps. To eliminate confounding complexity during evaluation, we adopt
a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) representation. Each KG explicitly delineates a
target image's core entities and their dependencies. We further introduce
MMMG-Score to evaluate generated knowledge images. This metric combines factual
fidelity, measured by graph-edit distance between KGs, with visual clarity
assessment. Comprehensive evaluations of 16 state-of-the-art text-to-image
generation models expose serious reasoning deficits--low entity fidelity, weak
relations, and clutter--with GPT-4o achieving an MMMG-Score of only 50.20,
underscoring the benchmark's difficulty. To spur further progress, we release
FLUX-Reason (MMMG-Score of 34.45), an effective and open baseline that combines
a reasoning LLM with diffusion models and is trained on 16,000 curated
knowledge image-prompt pairs.

*Qizhe Zhang,Mengzhen Liu,Lichen Li,Ming Lu,Yuan Zhang,Junwen Pan,Qi She,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CDPruner is a novel visual token pruning method for MLLMs that maximizes conditional diversity, improving efficiency while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency of current visual token pruning methods in MLLMs, which either retain redundant tokens or ignore instruction relevance.

Method: Proposes CDPruner, a training-free, model-agnostic method using determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize conditional diversity of retained tokens.

Result: Achieves SOTA on vision-language benchmarks, reducing FLOPs by 95% and latency by 78% while retaining 94% accuracy.

Conclusion: CDPruner effectively balances efficiency and performance in MLLMs by focusing on conditional diversity.

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual
tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts,
leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by
removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on
attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use
similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently
causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or
similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner,
which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define
the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the
instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal
point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected
subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing
easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs
show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language
benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected
subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user
instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction
ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency
by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available

TL;DR: The paper introduces GenWorld, a high-quality real-world dataset for AI-generated video detection, and SpannDetector, a model leveraging multi-view consistency for improved detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of realistic AI-generated videos threatens information credibility, but existing detectors lack reliable datasets.

Method: GenWorld is created with real-world simulation, high-quality forged videos, and cross-prompt diversity. SpannDetector uses multi-view consistency for detection.

Result: SpannDetector outperforms existing methods, especially for high-quality videos.

Conclusion: GenWorld and SpannDetector advance AI-generated video detection, emphasizing physical plausibility.

Abstract: The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuadricFormer introduces superquadrics for efficient 3D occupancy prediction, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing voxel-based and object-centric representations are inefficient or limited in modeling diverse geometries in driving scenes.

Method: Proposes a probabilistic superquadric mixture model and QuadricFormer, with a pruning-and-splitting module for efficiency.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset with superior efficiency.

Conclusion: Superquadrics enable efficient and accurate 3D occupancy prediction for autonomous driving.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is crucial for robust autonomous driving systems as
it enables comprehensive perception of environmental structures and semantics.
Most existing methods employ dense voxel-based scene representations, ignoring
the sparsity of driving scenes and resulting in inefficiency. Recent works
explore object-centric representations based on sparse Gaussians, but their
ellipsoidal shape prior limits the modeling of diverse structures. In
real-world driving scenes, objects exhibit rich geometries (e.g., cuboids,
cylinders, and irregular shapes), necessitating excessive ellipsoidal Gaussians
densely packed for accurate modeling, which leads to inefficient
representations. To address this, we propose to use geometrically expressive
superquadrics as scene primitives, enabling efficient representation of complex
structures with fewer primitives through their inherent shape diversity. We
develop a probabilistic superquadric mixture model, which interprets each
superquadric as an occupancy probability distribution with a corresponding
geometry prior, and calculates semantics through probabilistic mixture.
Building on this, we present QuadricFormer, a superquadric-based model for
efficient 3D occupancy prediction, and introduce a pruning-and-splitting module
to further enhance modeling efficiency by concentrating superquadrics in

that QuadricFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining

*Donghoon Ahn,Jiwon Kang,Sanghyun Lee,Minjae Kim,Jaewon Min,Wooseok Jang,Saungwu Lee,Sayak Paul,Susung Hong,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces 'HeadHunter' and 'SoftPAG' for fine-grained control in diffusion models by perturbing specific attention heads, improving generation quality and style manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining perturbation locations, especially in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures.

Method: Investigates granularity of attention perturbations, proposes 'HeadHunter' for head selection and 'SoftPAG' for tuning perturbation strength.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance in quality enhancement and style-specific guidance on models like Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1.

Conclusion: Provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation, enabling interpretable specialization and practical perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by
perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation
away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated
strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free
guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods
lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be
applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where
quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we
investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer
level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads
govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality.
Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for
iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives,
enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In
addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected
head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to
tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only
mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but
also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through
compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale
DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1,
demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and
style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of
attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable
specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of
effective perturbation strategies.

*Junqi You,Chieh Hubert Lin,Weijie Lyu,Zhengbo Zhang,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaInpaint is a fast, reference-based 3D scene inpainting framework that achieves real-time performance (0.4s) and outperforms prior methods by 1000x in speed while maintaining high quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene inpainting methods are slow and computationally intensive, making them impractical for real-time applications.

Method: Proposes InstaInpaint, a feed-forward framework using a 2D inpainting proposal and a self-supervised masked-finetuning strategy with a custom large reconstruction model (LRM).

Result: Achieves 1000x speed-up over prior methods with state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and generalizes well to applications like object insertion.

Conclusion: InstaInpaint enables real-time 3D scene inpainting with high quality and flexibility for interactive applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene reconstruction enable real-time viewing in
virtual and augmented reality. To support interactive operations for better
immersiveness, such as moving or editing objects, 3D scene inpainting methods
are proposed to repair or complete the altered geometry. However, current
approaches rely on lengthy and computationally intensive optimization, making
them impractical for real-time or online applications. We propose InstaInpaint,
a reference-based feed-forward framework that produces 3D-scene inpainting from
a 2D inpainting proposal within 0.4 seconds. We develop a self-supervised
masked-finetuning strategy to enable training of our custom large
reconstruction model (LRM) on the large-scale dataset. Through extensive
experiments, we analyze and identify several key designs that improve
generalization, textural consistency, and geometric correctness. InstaInpaint
achieves a 1000x speed-up from prior methods while maintaining a
state-of-the-art performance across two standard benchmarks. Moreover, we show
that InstaInpaint generalizes well to flexible downstream applications such as
object insertion and multi-region inpainting. More video results are available

### [155] [SceneCompleter: Dense 3D Scene Completion for Generative Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10981)
*Weiliang Chen,Jiayi Bi,Yuanhui Huang,Wenzhao Zheng,Yueqi Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneCompleter is a framework for 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis, combining RGBD space synthesis and holistic scene understanding to improve coherence and plausibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for novel view synthesis rely on 2D completion followed by 3D recovery, leading to smooth surfaces and distorted geometry due to lack of 3D structure inference from RGB data.

Method: SceneCompleter uses a geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model for RGBD space synthesis and a scene embedder for holistic understanding.

Result: The method achieves superior coherence and plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: SceneCompleter effectively fuses structural and textural information, outperforming conventional paradigms in 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis.

Abstract: Generative models have gained significant attention in novel view synthesis
(NVS) by alleviating the reliance on dense multi-view captures. However,
existing methods typically fall into a conventional paradigm, where generative
models first complete missing areas in 2D, followed by 3D recovery techniques
to reconstruct the scene, which often results in overly smooth surfaces and
distorted geometry, as generative models struggle to infer 3D structure solely
from RGB data. In this paper, we propose SceneCompleter, a novel framework that
achieves 3D-consistent generative novel view synthesis through dense 3D scene
completion. SceneCompleter achieves both visual coherence and 3D-consistent
generative scene completion through two key components: (1) a
geometry-appearance dual-stream diffusion model that jointly synthesizes novel
views in RGBD space; (2) a scene embedder that encodes a more holistic scene
understanding from the reference image. By effectively fusing structural and
textural information, our method demonstrates superior coherence and
plausibility in generative novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

*Kyubyung Chae,Hyunbin Jin,Taesup Kim*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: RAAI is a training-free, model-agnostic framework that uses LLM attack techniques to generate synthetic data for safety alignment, improving harmful response rates and model robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aligning LLMs with human preferences is costly and time-consuming; synthetic data offers a scalable alternative.

Method: RAAI detects refusal signals and injects predefined phrases to elicit harmful completions, repurposing attack techniques.

Result: RAAI increases harmful response rates from 2.15% to 61.04% and enhances model robustness without compromising general capabilities.

Conclusion: LLM attack methods can be repurposed for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.

*Elena Sofia Ruzzetti,Giancarlo A. Xompero,Davide Venditti,Fabio Massimo Zanzotto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PME turns LLMs' memorization into a privacy defense by detecting and editing memorized PII, reducing leakage without harming model performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs may memorize and leak PII from uncontrolled data, posing privacy risks.

Method: Detect memorized PII and edit the model's knowledge to mitigate memorization.

Result: PME reduces PII leakage, sometimes nullifying privacy attack accuracy, without affecting model performance.

Conclusion: PME effectively leverages memorization for privacy defense, enhancing robustness against data extraction attacks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of
uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII),
which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we
introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing
private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs'
memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks
against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their
training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order
to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the
memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We
verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while
making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We
demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a
number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the
privacy attacks to zero.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address cybersecurity challenges posed by LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini, including prompt injection, jailbreaking, and misinformation.

Method: Comparative analysis of ChatGPT and Gemini's security, plus taxonomy and experiments on jailbreak techniques.

Result: Findings likely highlight vulnerabilities and differences in security between the two models.

Conclusion: The study underscores the need for improved security measures in LLMs to mitigate risks like jailbreaking and misinformation.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) are transforming digital usage, particularly in
text generation, image creation, information retrieval and code development.
ChatGPT, launched by OpenAI in November 2022, quickly became a reference,
prompting the emergence of competitors such as Google's Gemini. However, these
technological advances raise new cybersecurity challenges, including prompt
injection attacks, the circumvention of regulatory measures (jailbreaking), the
spread of misinformation (hallucinations) and risks associated with deep fakes.

### [159] [GenBreak: Red Teaming Text-to-Image Generators Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10047)
*Zilong Wang,Xiang Zheng,Xiaosen Wang,Bo Wang,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GenBreak is a framework to systematically test vulnerabilities in text-to-image (T2I) models by fine-tuning an LLM to craft adversarial prompts that evade safety filters while producing harmful content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for evaluating T2I model safety are limited, either failing to bypass filters or not generating genuinely harmful content. GenBreak aims to address this gap.

Method: The framework fine-tunes an LLM using supervised learning and reinforcement learning, integrating multiple rewards to craft effective adversarial prompts.

Result: GenBreak successfully generates prompts that evade commercial T2I model defenses and produce harmful images, exposing safety weaknesses.

Conclusion: GenBreak provides a reliable tool for assessing T2I model safety, highlighting significant vulnerabilities in current defenses.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models such as Stable Diffusion have advanced rapidly and
are now widely used in content creation. However, these models can be misused
to generate harmful content, including nudity or violence, posing significant
safety risks. While most platforms employ content moderation systems,
underlying vulnerabilities can still be exploited by determined adversaries.
Recent research on red-teaming and adversarial attacks against T2I models has
notable limitations: some studies successfully generate highly toxic images but
use adversarial prompts that are easily detected and blocked by safety filters,
while others focus on bypassing safety mechanisms but fail to produce genuinely
harmful outputs, neglecting the discovery of truly high-risk prompts.
Consequently, there remains a lack of reliable tools for evaluating the safety
of defended T2I models. To address this gap, we propose GenBreak, a framework
that fine-tunes a red-team large language model (LLM) to systematically explore
underlying vulnerabilities in T2I generators. Our approach combines supervised
fine-tuning on curated datasets with reinforcement learning via interaction
with a surrogate T2I model. By integrating multiple reward signals, we guide
the LLM to craft adversarial prompts that enhance both evasion capability and
image toxicity, while maintaining semantic coherence and diversity. These
prompts demonstrate strong effectiveness in black-box attacks against
commercial T2I generators, revealing practical and concerning safety
weaknesses.

*Saswat Das,Jameson Sandler,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper introduces the CMPL framework, an auditing tool for conversational privacy risks in LLM agents, focusing on multi-turn interactions to uncover vulnerabilities missed by single-turn defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents handle sensitive data, increasing risks of unauthorized disclosures. Existing defenses focus on single-turn interactions, leaving multi-turn vulnerabilities unaddressed.

Method: Proposes the CMPL framework, an iterative probing strategy to stress-test agents by simulating realistic multi-turn interactions.

Result: CMPL reveals privacy risks undeterred by single-turn defenses, validated across diverse domains and configurations.

Conclusion: CMPL serves as a diagnostic tool, offering quantifiable risk metrics and an open benchmark for evaluating conversational privacy in LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants,
customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver
substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to
sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures.
This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that
quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for
Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to
stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing
solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn
interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation
on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the
auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by
existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic
tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable
risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy
across agent implementations.

*Yeonwoo Jang,Shariqah Hossain,Ashwin Sreevatsa,Diogo Cruz*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Some machine unlearning methods fail under prompt attacks, with ELM being particularly vulnerable. Robust methods like RMU and TAR exist, but evaluation frameworks are needed to ensure true knowledge removal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the vulnerability of machine unlearning methods to prompt attacks and determine if unlearned knowledge can still be retrieved.

Method: Systematic evaluation of eight unlearning techniques across three model families using output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis.

Result: ELM is vulnerable (57.3% accuracy recovery), while RMU and TAR are robust. Logit analysis shows unlearned models don't hide knowledge via output formatting.

Conclusion: Current unlearning assumptions are challenged; better evaluation frameworks are needed to distinguish true knowledge removal from output suppression.

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when
subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight
unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based,
logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly
unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR
demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt
attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy).
Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding
knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation
between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing
assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for
evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge
removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our
evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve
unlearning knowledge.

*S. Vasavi Venkata Lakshmi,Ziaul Haque Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper proposes using quantum cryptography (QKD, BB84, and QOTP) to secure cloud data against future quantum threats.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data security methods may fail against quantum computers, necessitating quantum-resistant solutions.

Method: Uses Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with the BB84 protocol and Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP) for encryption.

Result: Demonstrates a secure framework for cloud data protection, resistant to quantum attacks.

Conclusion: Quantum cryptography ensures robust, future-proof security for cloud computing.

Abstract: Cloud computing has made storing and accessing data easier but keeping it
secure is a big challenge nowadays. Traditional methods of ensuring data may
not be strong enough in the future when powerful quantum computers become
available. To solve this problem, this study uses quantum cryptography to
protect data in the cloud environment. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) creates
secure keys by sending information using quantum particles like photons.
Specifically, we use the BB84 protocol, a simple and reliable way to make
secure keys that cannot be stolen without detection. To protect the data, we
use the Quantum One Time pad (QOTP) for encryption and decryption, ensuring the
data stays completely private. This study shows how these Quantum methods can
be applied in cloud systems to provide a strong defense against hackers, even
if they have access to quantum computers. The combination of QKD, BB84, and
QOTP creates a safe and reliable way to keep data secure when it is stored or
shared in the cloud. Using quantum cryptography, this paper provides a way to
ensure data security now and in the future, making cloud computing safer for
everyone to store their data securely and safely.

TL;DR: The paper presents an encoding of Levy's CBPV in the pi-calculus, proving its soundness and completeness, and discusses its alignment with Gorla's criteria and similarities to Milner's encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in formalizing CBPV in the pi-calculus, particularly with de Bruijn indices, and to explore bisimulation properties.

Method: Specialized encoding in the internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus), informal proofs, and partial Coq formalization.

Result: The encoding is sound, complete, and meets Gorla's criteria, with bisimulation congruence properties.

Conclusion: The work provides a robust encoding framework and lays groundwork for future formal proofs.

Abstract: In this report we define an encoding of Levys call-by-push-value
lambda-calculus (CBPV) in the pi-calculus, and prove that our encoding is both
sound and complete. We present informal (by-hand) proofs of soundness,
completeness, and all required lemmas. The encoding is specialized to the
internal pi-calculus (pi-i-calculus) to circumvent certain challenges
associated with using de Bruijn index in a formalization, and it also helps
with bisimulation as early-, late- and open-bisimulation coincide in this
setting, furthermore bisimulation is a congruence. Additionally, we argue that
our encoding also satisfies the five criteria for good encodings proposed by
Gorla, as well as show similarities between Milners and our encoding. This
paper includes encodings from CBPV in the pi-i-calculus, asynchronous polyadic
pi-calculus and the local pi-calculus. We begin a formalization of the proof in
Coq for the soundness and completeness of the encoding in the pi-i-calculus.
Not all lemmas used in the formalization are themselves formally proven.
However, we argue that the non-proven lemmas are reasonable, as they are proven
by hand, or amount to Coq formalities that are straightforward given informal
arguments.

TL;DR: A Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework improves GRF estimation from wearable insole sensors by leveraging temporal and similarity features, outperforming current baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of high-cost treadmills and noisy insole sensors for accurate GRF measurement in gait analysis.

Method: Proposes a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework to enhance GRF estimation by capturing feature relationships and sequential properties.

Result: Empirical results show the framework outperforms existing methods in GRF estimation from insole sensor data.

Conclusion: The framework provides a portable, cost-effective solution for accurate GRF measurement in gait analysis applications.

Abstract: Human gait analysis with wearable sensors has been widely used in various
applications, such as daily life healthcare, rehabilitation, physical therapy,
and clinical diagnostics and monitoring. In particular, ground reaction force
(GRF) provides critical information about how the body interacts with the
ground during locomotion. Although instrumented treadmills have been widely
used as the gold standard for measuring GRF during walking, their lack of
portability and high cost make them impractical for many applications. As an
alternative, low-cost, portable, wearable insole sensors have been utilized to
measure GRF; however, these sensors are susceptible to noise and disturbance
and are less accurate than treadmill measurements. To address these challenges,
we propose a Time-aware Knowledge Distillation framework for GRF estimation
from insole sensor data. This framework leverages similarity and temporal
features within a mini-batch during the knowledge distillation process,
effectively capturing the complementary relationships between features and the
sequential properties of the target and input data. The performance of the
lightweight models distilled through this framework was evaluated by comparing
GRF estimations from insole sensor data against measurements from an
instrumented treadmill. Empirical results demonstrated that Time-aware
Knowledge Distillation outperforms current baselines in GRF estimation from
wearable sensor data.

*Rongfei Li,Francis Assadian*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: The paper proposes an algorithm for optimizing camera location in eye-to-hand visual servoing to minimize image noise, improving observation accuracy with limited energy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing research neglects the impact of camera location on image noise in eye-to-hand configurations, which affects estimation quality in manufacturing environments.

Method: An adaptive algorithm explores the camera workspace to find optimal or suboptimal locations, using image averaging to enhance accuracy without filtering high-frequency data.

Result: Simulations demonstrate improved observation precision with limited energy, validating the algorithm's effectiveness.

Conclusion: The algorithm efficiently optimizes camera placement, enhancing visual servoing performance in automated manufacturing.

Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many
automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a
full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or
eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing
environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control
and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have
discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration.
In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the
camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches
for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this
algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is
unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy
available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the
algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the
search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging
technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation
accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering
out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated
manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success
of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.

Conclusion: The new CP and STP-based CNN effectively avoid padding issues and are applicable to practical identification tasks.

Abstract: The semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors is a generalization of conventional
inner product of vectors, which allows the factor vectors to of different

Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since

Motivation: To address the lack of unified comparisons in existing studies and provide a comprehensive evaluation of discrete audio tokenizers.

Method: Proposes a taxonomy of tokenization approaches, evaluates tokenizers on benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and conducts ablation studies.

Result: Highlights key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges in discrete audio tokenization.

Conclusion: Provides insights and guidance for future research in token-based audio processing.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve
perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while
enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance
across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to
continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern
large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing
grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have
reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often
focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various
benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete
audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We
propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder,
quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application
domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction,
downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs
through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations,
practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and optimize the mechanisms for transferring rich semantic audio representations to LLMs, as current methods are under-explored.

Method: Proposes modifications to a standard audio-LLM architecture, testing hypotheses about delayed integration, attention-only probing, and diverse encoder ensembles.

Result: Delayed audio integration and attention-only probing enhance performance; an ensemble of encoders broadens information capacity, yielding 10-60% improvements.

Conclusion: The proposed architectural modifications significantly optimize cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs, validated by controlled experiments.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models

underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic

conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to
proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual
queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural
design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style
audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by
hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM
operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio
integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that
enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant
information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations
exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring
propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently
integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary
representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider
spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical
three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs,
ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all
proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over
the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information
transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

### [169] [Rethinking Brain Tumor Segmentation from the Frequency Domain Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10142)
*Minye Shao,Zeyu Wang,Haoran Duan,Yawen Huang,Bing Zhai,Shizheng Wang,Yang Long,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces HFF-Net, a frequency-domain approach for precise brain tumor segmentation in MRI, addressing challenges in contrast-enhancing regions with novel modules like FDD, ALC, and FDCA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with segmenting contrast-enhancing brain tumor regions due to insufficient consideration of MRI-specific features like textures and directional variations.

Method: Proposes HFF-Net with Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD), Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC), and Frequency Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) modules to analyze and fuse tumor features in the frequency domain.

Result: HFF-Net improves mean Dice scores by 4.48% on average and enhances contrast-enhancing tumor segmentation by 7.33%, with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: HFF-Net offers a robust, frequency-domain solution for brain tumor segmentation, validated by experiments and clinical applicability.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors, particularly contrast-enhancing regions
visible in post-contrast MRI (areas highlighted by contrast agent injection),
is crucial for accurate clinical diagnosis and treatment planning but remains
challenging. However, current methods exhibit notable performance degradation
in segmenting these enhancing brain tumor areas, largely due to insufficient
consideration of MRI-specific tumor features such as complex textures and
directional variations. To address this, we propose the Harmonized Frequency
Fusion Network (HFF-Net), which rethinks brain tumor segmentation from a
frequency-domain perspective. To comprehensively characterize tumor regions, we
develop a Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) module that separates MRI images
into low-frequency components, capturing smooth tumor contours and
high-frequency components, highlighting detailed textures and directional
edges. To further enhance sensitivity to tumor boundaries, we introduce an
Adaptive Laplacian Convolution (ALC) module that adaptively emphasizes critical
high-frequency details using dynamically updated convolution kernels. To
effectively fuse tumor features across multiple scales, we design a Frequency
Domain Cross-Attention (FDCA) integrating semantic, positional, and
slice-specific information. We further validate and interpret frequency-domain
improvements through visualization, theoretical reasoning, and experimental
analyses. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that
HFF-Net achieves an average relative improvement of 4.48\% (ranging from 2.39\%
to 7.72\%) in the mean Dice scores across the three major subregions, and an
average relative improvement of 7.33% (ranging from 5.96% to 8.64%) in the
segmentation of contrast-enhancing tumor regions, while maintaining favorable
computational efficiency and clinical applicability. Code:

*Emerson P. Grabke,Masoom A. Haider,Babak Taati*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CCELLA, a dual-head conditioning approach for LDMs in medical imaging, improving performance and accessibility with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations in medical LDM training, such as reliance on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes.

Method: Proposes CCELLA, a dual-head conditioning method combining text features and pathology classification, alongside a joint loss function and data-efficient training framework.

Result: Achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025, outperforms a foundation model (FID 0.071), and improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%.

Conclusion: CCELLA enables high-quality medical image synthesis with limited data, enhancing LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges
affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical
LDM training typically relies on performance- or scientific
accessibility-limiting strategies including a reliance on short-prompt text
encoders, the reuse of non-medical LDMs, or a requirement for fine-tuning with
large data volumes. We propose a Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language
model Adapter (CCELLA) to address these limitations. CCELLA is a novel
dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net
with non-medical large language model-encoded text features through
cross-attention and with pathology classification through the timestep
embedding. We also propose a joint loss function and a data-efficient LDM
training framework. In combination, these strategies enable
pathology-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis
given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance
and scientific accessibility. Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a
size-limited prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent
foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer
prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method to the training
dataset improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier
solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to
training on real images alone.

*Ana Lawry Aguila,Peirong Liu,Oula Puonti,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A novel conditional diffusion model for unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI, outperforming existing methods by integrating synthetic pseudo-pathologies for better reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised learning requires diseased training data, which is scarce for rare diseases. Unsupervised methods often fail to reconstruct anomalies accurately.

Method: A weakly supervised approach using synthetic pseudo-pathologies generated via fluid-driven anomaly randomization, integrated into a conditional diffusion model.

Result: Outperforms variational autoencoders, latent diffusion models, and even supervised inpainting methods on synthetic and real pathology datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework improves anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction, addressing limitations of existing unsupervised methods.

Abstract: Supervised machine learning has enabled accurate pathology detection in brain
MRI, but requires training data from diseased subjects that may not be readily
available in some scenarios, for example, in the case of rare diseases.
Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection, in particular using
diffusion models, has gained popularity in the medical field as it allows for
training on healthy images alone, eliminating the need for large
disease-specific cohorts. These methods assume that a model trained on normal
data cannot accurately represent or reconstruct anomalies. However, this
assumption often fails with models failing to reconstruct healthy tissue or
accurately reconstruct abnormal regions i.e., failing to remove anomalies. In
this work, we introduce a novel conditional diffusion model framework for
anomaly detection and healthy image reconstruction in brain MRI. Our weakly
supervised approach integrates synthetically generated pseudo-pathology images
into the modeling process to better guide the reconstruction of healthy images.
To generate these pseudo-pathologies, we apply fluid-driven anomaly
randomization to augment real pathology segmentation maps from an auxiliary
dataset, ensuring that the synthetic anomalies are both realistic and
anatomically coherent. We evaluate our model's ability to detect pathology,
using both synthetic anomaly datasets and real pathology from the ATLAS
dataset. In our extensive experiments, our model: (i) consistently outperforms
variational autoencoders, and conditional and unconditional latent diffusion;
and (ii) surpasses on most datasets, the performance of supervised inpainting
methods with access to paired diseased/healthy images.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DUN-SRE, a novel deep unrolling network, integrates spatiotemporal rotation equivariance for dynamic MRI reconstruction, improving image quality under aggressive undersampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ECNNs fail to model temporal symmetry, a key prior in dynamic MRI. DUN-SRE addresses this gap by incorporating spatiotemporal symmetry.

Method: DUN-SRE uses a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture, combining data consistency and proximal mapping in a deep unrolling framework.

Result: DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cardiac CINE MRI, preserving rotation-symmetric structures and generalizing well.

Conclusion: DUN-SRE effectively models spatiotemporal symmetry, enhancing dynamic MRI reconstruction quality and accuracy.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries,
including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal
symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry
priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality,
especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant
convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting
spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model
temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior
in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep
Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for
Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance
through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it
integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified
deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of
spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction
process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics
in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization
mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing
symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets
demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization
capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

*Cheng Wang,Siqi Chen,Donghua Mi,Yang Chen,Yudong Zhang,Yinsheng Li*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SWDL-Net, a semi-supervised learning framework, combines Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling for superior intracranial hemorrhage segmentation with minimal labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of scarce labeled data in intracranial hemorrhage segmentation by leveraging semi-supervised learning.

Method: Proposes SWDL-Net, integrating Laplacian pyramid for edge sharpening and deep convolutions for detail precision via difference learning.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only 2% labeled data on ICH dataset and 5% on BHSD.

Conclusion: SWDL-Net effectively combines complementary techniques for high-quality segmentation with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical imaging have established deep learning-based
segmentation as the predominant approach, though it typically requires large
amounts of manually annotated data. However, obtaining annotations for
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) remains particularly challenging due to the
tedious and costly labeling process. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged
as a promising solution to address the scarcity of labeled data, especially in
volumetric medical image segmentation. Unlike conventional SSL methods that
primarily focus on high-confidence pseudo-labels or consistency regularization,
we propose SWDL-Net, a novel SSL framework that exploits the complementary
advantages of Laplacian pyramid and deep convolutional upsampling. The
Laplacian pyramid excels at edge sharpening, while deep convolutions enhance
detail precision through flexible feature mapping. Our framework achieves
superior segmentation of lesion details and boundaries through a difference
learning mechanism that effectively integrates these complementary approaches.
Extensive experiments on a 271-case ICH dataset and public benchmarks
demonstrate that SWDL-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
scenarios with only 2% labeled data. Additional evaluations on the publicly
available Brain Hemorrhage Segmentation Dataset (BHSD) with 5% labeled data
further confirm the superiority of our approach. Code and data have been
released at https://github.com/SIAT-CT-LAB/SWDL.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: ConStyX improves medical image segmentation by augmenting both content and style in training data, enhancing domain generalization while mitigating over-augmentation effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts in medical images impair segmentation models; existing domain randomization methods are limited by style-only augmentation and over-augmentation issues.

Method: Proposes ConStyX, which augments both content and style of training data and mitigates negative effects of over-augmented features.

Result: ConStyX achieves superior generalization performance across multiple domains.

Conclusion: ConStyX effectively addresses domain generalization challenges in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Medical images are usually collected from multiple domains, leading to domain
shifts that impair the performance of medical image segmentation models. Domain
Generalization (DG) aims to address this issue by training a robust model with
strong generalizability. Recently, numerous domain randomization-based DG
methods have been proposed. However, these methods suffer from the following
limitations: 1) constrained efficiency of domain randomization due to their
exclusive dependence on image style perturbation, and 2) neglect of the adverse
effects of over-augmented images on model training. To address these issues, we
propose a novel domain randomization-based DG method, called content style
augmentation (ConStyX), for generalizable medical image segmentation.
Specifically, ConStyX 1) augments the content and style of training data,
allowing the augmented training data to better cover a wider range of data
domains, and 2) leverages well-augmented features while mitigating the negative
effects of over-augmented features during model training. Extensive experiments
across multiple domains demonstrate that our ConStyX achieves superior
generalization performance. The code is available at

Result: Generalist models show promise but face challenges in compliance, privacy, and performance compared to specialized models.

Conclusion: Future directions include synthetic data, early fusion, and lessons from NLP, with emphasis on clinical translation and trustworthy AI.

Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging
pre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different
downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision.
The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on
segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of
architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a
comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image
segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts
underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different
declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on
the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and
others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their
performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature,
followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific
models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with
regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy
artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future

generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI,
and clinical translation.

*Zhenhuan Zhou*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Med-URWKV is a pure RWKV-based medical image segmentation model leveraging pre-trained VRWKV encoders, outperforming scratch-trained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods (CNNs, Transformers, hybrids) have limitations like restricted receptive fields or high computational costs. RWKV offers linear complexity and strong long-range modeling, but its potential in medical segmentation via pre-training is unexplored.

Method: Proposes Med-URWKV, a U-Net-based pure RWKV architecture with ImageNet pre-training, reusing a pre-trained VRWKV encoder.

Result: Outperforms scratch-trained RWKV models on seven datasets, validating pre-training's effectiveness.

Conclusion: Med-URWKV demonstrates the advantages of pre-trained RWKV encoders in medical segmentation, achieving competitive or superior performance.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a fundamental and key technology in
computer-aided diagnosis and treatment. Previous methods can be broadly
classified into three categories: convolutional neural network (CNN) based,
Transformer based, and hybrid architectures that combine both. However, each of
them has its own limitations, such as restricted receptive fields in CNNs or
the computational overhead caused by the quadratic complexity of Transformers.
Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model has emerged as a
promising alternative for various vision tasks, offering strong long-range
modeling capabilities with linear computational complexity. Some studies have
also adapted RWKV to medical image segmentation tasks, achieving competitive
performance. However, most of these studies focus on modifications to the
Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) mechanism and train models from scratch, without exploring
the potential advantages of leveraging pre-trained VRWKV models for medical
image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose Med-URWKV, a pure
RWKV-based architecture built upon the U-Net framework, which incorporates
ImageNet-based pretraining to further explore the potential of RWKV in medical
image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Med-URWKV is the first
pure RWKV segmentation model in the medical field that can directly reuse a
large-scale pre-trained VRWKV encoder. Experimental results on seven datasets
demonstrate that Med-URWKV achieves comparable or even superior segmentation
performance compared to other carefully optimized RWKV models trained from
scratch. This validates the effectiveness of using a pretrained VRWKV encoder
in enhancing model performance. The codes will be released.

TL;DR: An AI algorithm is proposed for detecting and localizing artifacts in digital pathology slides, using deep learning to improve accuracy and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current quality assurance methods in digital pathology are manual and lack deep learning integration, creating a need for more efficient and scalable solutions.

Method: The algorithm analyzes tiles of digital pathology slides, categorizing them into 10 artifact types or background, and uses InceptionResNet for training. A hybrid design of single and multiple instance models is suggested.

Result: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid model in detecting artifacts like chatter, fold, and pen, optimizing detection accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed AI algorithm enhances quality assurance by reducing manual review time and improving artifact detection in digital pathology.

Abstract: Quality assurance is a critical but underexplored area in digital pathology,
where even minor artifacts can have significant effects. Artifacts have been
shown to negatively impact the performance of AI diagnostic models. In current
practice, trained staff manually review digitized images prior to release of
these slides to pathologists which are then used to render a diagnosis.
Conventional image processing approaches, provide a foundation for detecting
artifacts on digital pathology slides. However, current tools do not leverage
deep learning, which has the potential to improve detection accuracy and
scalability. Despite these advancements, methods for quality assurance in
digital pathology remain limited, presenting a gap for innovation.
  We propose an AI algorithm designed to screen digital pathology slides by
analyzing tiles and categorizing them into one of 10 predefined artifact types
or as background. This algorithm identifies and localizes artifacts, creating a
map that highlights regions of interest. By directing human operators to
specific tiles affected by artifacts, the algorithm minimizes the time and
effort required to manually review entire slides for quality issues.
  From internal archives and The Cancer Genome Atlas, 133 whole slide images
were selected and 10 artifacts were annotated using an internally developed
software ZAPP (Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL). Ablation study of multiple
models at different tile sizes and magnification was performed. InceptionResNet
was selected. Single artifact models were trained and tested, followed by a
limited multiple instance model with artifacts that performed well together
(chatter, fold, and pen). From the results of this study we suggest a hybrid
design for artifact screening composed of both single artifact binary models as
well as multiple instance models to optimize detection of each artifact.

TL;DR: Medical foundation models (e.g., language, vision-language, multimodal) assist in clinical tasks but struggle with contextual errors due to lack of dynamic adaptation. The paper proposes context-switching AI to improve adaptability without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current medical AI models lack dynamic adaptation to new contexts, leading to errors. The goal is to enhance their ability to adjust across specialties, populations, and workflows.

Method: Proposes context-switching AI that dynamically adapts reasoning without retraining, addressing limitations of fine-tuning and prompting.

Result: Envisions AI capable of diagnosing and treating diverse diseases across specialties and regions, improving access to care.

Conclusion: Context-switching AI could overcome current limitations, enabling more flexible and accurate medical applications.

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical
notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on
electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical
questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new
populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful
prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and
limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical
situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to
contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for
critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a
fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting
their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective,
we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that
dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties,
populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to
diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and
regions, and expand access to medical care.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning

Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this
discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific

through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific
attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE
comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning
66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08%

Result: Specialized LLMs for mathematical reasoning outperform general-purpose models on TeleMath.

Conclusion: TeleMath fills a research gap and supports future work, with dataset and code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has
raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements
have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their
effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network
optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically
designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with
numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500
question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the
telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation
pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter
Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best
performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for
mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even
those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges.
We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result
reproducibility and support future research.

Motivation: Toxicity is a major cause of drug development failure, but molecular toxicity repair lacks systematic definition and benchmarking.

Method: ToxiMol provides a standardized dataset and prompt annotation pipeline, while ToxiEval integrates multiple metrics for evaluation.

Result: Current MLLMs show potential in toxicity understanding and molecule editing but face significant challenges.

Conclusion: The work establishes a foundation for future improvements in molecular toxicity repair using MLLMs.

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure.
Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of
molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular
alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or
benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task
for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on
molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11
primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse
mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with
mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert
toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation
framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic
accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput
evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30
mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to
analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and
failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs
still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate
promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint
adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

Conclusion: Dialogue continuation effectively captures caption meaning and enables versatile instruction-following.

Abstract: We propose an instruction-following audio comprehension model that leverages
the dialogue continuation ability of large language models (LLMs). Instead of
directly generating target captions in training data, the proposed method
trains a model to produce responses as if the input caption triggered a
dialogue. This dialogue continuation training mitigates the caption variation
problem. Learning to continue a dialogue effectively captures the caption's
meaning beyond its surface-level words. As a result, our model enables
zero-shot instruction-following capability without multitask instruction
tuning, even trained solely on audio captioning datasets. Experiments on
AudioCaps, WavCaps, and Clotho datasets with AudioBench audio-scene
question-answering tests demonstrate our model's ability to follow various
unseen instructions.

### [183] [Robust Unsupervised Adaptation of a Speech Recogniser Using Entropy Minimisation and Speaker Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10653)
*Rogier C. van Dalen,Shucong Zhang,Titouan Parcollet,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: A robust adaptation method for speech recognizers using conditional entropy and speaker codes improves word error rates with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Speech recognizers often underperform in new environments or with new speakers due to limited labeled data.

Method: Proposes a novel loss function (conditional entropy over complete hypotheses) and a compact 'speaker code' for adaptation.

Result: Achieves 20% relative improvement in word error rate with one minute of data, increasing to 29% with 10 minutes.

Conclusion: The proposed method enhances adaptation robustness and performance with minimal unlabeled data.

Abstract: Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment
and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new
speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that
data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to
make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating
the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis
or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional
entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation
more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code"
characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data
to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the
proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one
minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.

*Shangpin Peng,Weinong Wang,Zhuotao Tian,Senqiao Yang,Xing Wu,Haotian Xu,Chengquan Zhang,Takashi Isobe,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omni-DPO improves DPO by adaptively weighting preference pairs based on quality and model performance, outperforming baselines and Claude 3 Opus.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DPO methods treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal performance.

Method: Omni-DPO uses a dual-perspective framework to weight samples by data quality and model learning dynamics.

Result: Omni-DPO outperforms baselines, beating Claude 3 Opus by 6.7 points on Arena-Hard and excelling in mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Omni-DPO is effective and robust, with superior performance and generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and
efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all
preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent
quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective
optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of
each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs.
By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's
learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training
data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on
various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization
capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it
finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant
margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning
tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all
benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and
robustness of our approach. Code and models will be available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning improves sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia by adapting to author-specific behaviors, outperforming pre-trained models in precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sockpuppet detection by addressing limitations of prior methods, which lack adaptability to author-specific behaviors and struggle with limited text data.

Method: Proposes meta-learning to train models across multiple tasks for rapid adaptation to new sockpuppet-group writing styles.

Result: Meta-learning significantly boosts prediction precision compared to pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Meta-learning advances sockpuppet detection, especially in data-scarce settings, and a new dataset is released for future research.

Abstract: Malicious sockpuppet detection on Wikipedia is critical to preserving access
to reliable information on the internet and preventing the spread of
disinformation. Prior machine learning approaches rely on stylistic and
meta-data features, but do not prioritise adaptability to author-specific
behaviours. As a result, they struggle to effectively model the behaviour of
specific sockpuppet-groups, especially when text data is limited. To address
this, we propose the application of meta-learning, a machine learning technique
designed to improve performance in data-scarce settings by training models
across multiple tasks. Meta-learning optimises a model for rapid adaptation to
the writing style of a new sockpuppet-group. Our results show that
meta-learning significantly enhances the precision of predictions compared to
pre-trained models, marking an advancement in combating sockpuppetry on open
editing platforms. We release a new dataset of sockpuppet investigations to
foster future research in both sockpuppetry and meta-learning fields.

*Wanqiao Xu,Allen Nie,Ruijie Zheng,Aditya Modi,Adith Swaminathan,Ching-An Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper formalizes Learning from Language Feedback (LLF), introduces a complexity measure (transfer eluder dimension), and presents a no-regret algorithm (HELiX) for solving LLF problems with performance guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled framework for learning from language feedback, addressing the lack of formalization in this area despite empirical progress.

Method: Formalizes LLF, introduces transfer eluder dimension as a complexity measure, and develops the HELiX algorithm for no-regret learning.

Result: Demonstrates cases where language feedback accelerates learning exponentially compared to rewards, with HELiX performing well empirically.

Conclusion: The work lays foundational principles for interactive learning from language feedback, validated by theoretical and empirical results.

Abstract: Interactively learning from observation and language feedback is an
increasingly studied area driven by the emergence of large language model (LLM)
agents. While impressive empirical demonstrations have been shown, so far a
principled framing of these decision problems remains lacking. In this paper,
we formalize the Learning from Language Feedback (LLF) problem, assert
sufficient assumptions to enable learning despite latent rewards, and introduce
$\textit{transfer eluder dimension}$ as a complexity measure to characterize
the hardness of LLF problems. We show that transfer eluder dimension captures
the intuition that information in the feedback changes the learning complexity
of the LLF problem. We demonstrate cases where learning from rich language
feedback can be exponentially faster than learning from reward. We develop a
no-regret algorithm, called $\texttt{HELiX}$, that provably solves LLF problems
through sequential interactions, with performance guarantees that scale with
the transfer eluder dimension of the problem. Across several empirical domains,
we show that $\texttt{HELiX}$ performs well even when repeatedly prompting LLMs
does not work reliably. Our contributions mark a first step towards designing
principled interactive learning algorithms from generic language feedback.

*Penguin Huang,Chhavi Yadav,Ruihan Wu,Kamalika Chaudhuri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper introduces PropInfer, a benchmark for evaluating property inference attacks on LLMs, demonstrating vulnerabilities in fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess if property inference attacks, previously studied in other models, apply to LLMs, especially when fine-tuned on sensitive domain-specific data.

Method: Developed PropInfer benchmark with two fine-tuning paradigms (question-answering and chat-completion) and proposed two attacks: prompt-based generation and shadow-model attacks.

Result: Empirical evaluations confirmed the success of the attacks, revealing vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Conclusion: LLMs are susceptible to property inference attacks, highlighting a new security concern for fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on domain-specific
datasets to support applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and
law. These fine-tuning datasets often have sensitive and confidential
dataset-level properties -- such as patient demographics or disease prevalence
-- that are not intended to be revealed. While prior work has studied property
inference attacks on discriminative models (e.g., image classification models)
and generative models (e.g., GANs for image data), it remains unclear if such
attacks transfer to LLMs. In this work, we introduce PropInfer, a benchmark
task for evaluating property inference in LLMs under two fine-tuning paradigms:
question-answering and chat-completion. Built on the ChatDoctor dataset, our
benchmark includes a range of property types and task configurations. We
further propose two tailored attacks: a prompt-based generation attack and a
shadow-model attack leveraging word frequency signals. Empirical evaluations
across multiple pretrained LLMs show the success of our attacks, revealing a
previously unrecognized vulnerability in LLMs.

*Jikai Jin,Vasilis Syrgkanis,Sham Kakade,Hanlin Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A causal representation learning framework is proposed to evaluate language model capabilities by modeling benchmark performance as linear transformations of latent factors, revealing a three-node causal structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address methodological challenges in causal evaluations of language models, such as confounding effects and computational costs.

Method: A causal representation learning framework identifies latent capability factors, controlling for base model confounders, applied to 1500+ models across six benchmarks.

Result: A concise three-node linear causal structure explains performance variations, revealing a causal progression from problem-solving to mathematical reasoning.

Conclusion: Controlling for base model variations is critical for uncovering causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving
actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal
evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges,
including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs
associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance
is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors.
Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after
appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying
this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models
evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a
concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed
performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure
provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings:
specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general
problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following
proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results
underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations
during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying
causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-IMM is a dataset for irregular multimodal time series, and IMM-TSF is a benchmark library for forecasting on such data, showing performance gains when modeling multimodality explicitly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world time series data are often irregular and messy, but existing benchmarks assume clean, regular data, creating a gap between research and practical applications.

Method: Time-IMM captures nine types of irregularity, and IMM-TSF provides fusion modules (timestamp-to-text and multimodality) with recency-aware and attention-based strategies.

Result: Explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular data improves forecasting performance.

Conclusion: Time-IMM and IMM-TSF advance time series analysis under real-world conditions, with publicly available resources.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate
modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying
sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However,
existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data,
creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We
introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven
irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine
distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based,
constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we
introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal
time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation.
IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text
fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both
recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical
results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time
series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and
IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under
real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the

*Reza Karbasi,Masoud Rahimi,Abdol-Hossein Vahabie,Hadi Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline for digitizing paper-based ECG recordings, handling signal overlaps with a U-Net segmentation and adaptive digitization, outperforming baselines in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing the challenge of digitizing ECG recordings with overlapping signals, a common but under-addressed issue in existing methods.

Method: A U-Net segmentation network isolates the primary ECG trace, followed by adaptive digitization with grid detection for varied ECG formats.

Result: U-Net achieves 0.87 IoU; digitization outperforms baselines (MSE 0.0010 vs. 0.0015, rho 0.9644 vs. 0.9366 for non-overlapping; MSE 0.0029 vs. 0.0178, rho 0.9641 vs. 0.8676 for overlapping).

Conclusion: The method enhances digitization accuracy, especially for overlapping signals, supporting reliable conversion of analog ECG data for research and clinical use.

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing
paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on
robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet
under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage
pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net
based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping
signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the
primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into
a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an
adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG
formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained
segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior
performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both
non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping
signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366,
respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method
achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the
baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to
significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of
signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion
of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research
and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this
GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

TL;DR: The paper presents Neural, a method for clinical QA over EHRs, decoupling evidence retrieval and answer synthesis, achieving high performance with prompt optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge information gaps in healthcare by improving automated QA over EHRs with precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited supervision.

Method: Decouples QA into sentence-level evidence identification and answer synthesis with citations, using DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer for prompt tuning and a self-consistency voting scheme.

Result: Achieved an overall score of 51.5 on the test set, outperforming zero-shot and few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively.

Conclusion: Data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative to fine-tuning for clinical QA, enhancing AI reliability in healthcare.

Abstract: Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can
bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands
both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited
supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025
ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method
decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2)
answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically
explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning
instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A
self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without
sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall
score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and
few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results
indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative
to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of
AI assistants in healthcare.

TL;DR: The paper introduces Duo, a method to improve uniform-state discrete diffusion models by leveraging insights from Gaussian diffusion, achieving faster training and sampling while outperforming autoregressive models in some benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models underperform compared to autoregressive and masked diffusion models despite their self-correcting potential. The paper aims to bridge this gap by exploiting connections to Gaussian diffusion.

Method: Duo transfers techniques from Gaussian diffusion to discrete diffusion. It uses curriculum learning guided by Gaussian processes for faster training and introduces Discrete Consistency Distillation for efficient few-step generation.

Result: Models trained with Duo's curriculum learning outperform autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Sampling speed improves by two orders of magnitude with Discrete Consistency Distillation.

Conclusion: Duo successfully narrows the performance gap between uniform-state diffusion models and autoregressive/masked diffusion models, demonstrating the potential of Gaussian-inspired techniques in discrete settings.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text
generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are
typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In
this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight:
Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian
diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian
diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a
curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training
speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass
autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we
present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency
distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm
unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating
sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints

*Adam Karvonen,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper highlights that simple anti-bias prompts fail in realistic hiring scenarios for LLMs, introduces internal bias mitigation to reduce biases, and shows its effectiveness across multiple models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the failure of existing anti-bias prompts in realistic hiring contexts and ensure equitable outcomes in high-stakes LLM applications.

Method: Internal bias mitigation by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions in model activations, using affine concept editing at inference time.

Result: Significant racial and gender biases emerge in realistic contexts (up to 12% differences), but internal mitigation reduces biases to under 2.5% while maintaining performance.

Conclusion: Practitioners should adopt realistic evaluations and internal mitigation strategies for fair LLM deployment in hiring.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring
applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and
livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate
demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail
when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures
through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive
attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction
across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4
Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3,
Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names,
culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring
constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces
significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview
rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White
candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and
scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from
subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible
even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these
limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated
directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using
directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes
robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%,
always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings
suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more
realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies
for equitable outcomes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUARD is a novel framework for LLM unlearning that uses data attribution to mitigate unintended forgetting while preserving model utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing unintended forgetting in LLM unlearning due to regulatory, copyright, and privacy concerns, focusing on data-level factors.

Method: Introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric and an adaptive unlearning objective with nonuniform weights.

Result: GUARD improves retention significantly (up to 194.92% in Truth Ratio) while maintaining unlearning effectiveness.

Conclusion: GUARD offers a robust solution for LLM unlearning by balancing retention and forgetting through data attribution.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important
due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns.
However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the
removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its
retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily
focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on
unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods
often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To
address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And
Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight
proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the
"alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally
efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that
assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely
proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of
unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide
rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention
while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive
experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate
that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective
unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to
194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

TL;DR: The paper proposes a shift in web agent research towards Agentic Web Interfaces (AWI), designed specifically for AI agents, to overcome limitations of human-designed interfaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current web agents struggle with human-designed interfaces, prompting the need for interfaces optimized for AI capabilities.

Method: Introduces the concept of AWI, outlining six design principles focusing on safety, efficiency, and standardization.

Result: AWI aims to improve efficiency, reliability, and transparency in web agent interactions.

Conclusion: The paper advocates for collaborative efforts to develop AWI, addressing fundamental limitations of existing interfaces.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.

TL;DR: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings improve out-of-distribution recognition, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance discrimination between in- and out-of-distribution samples in deep learning.

Method: Introduces Balanced Hyperbolic Learning, optimizing hierarchical distortion and balance, and generalizes scoring functions for hyperbolic prototypes.

Result: Outperforms 13 datasets and scoring functions, beating state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Hierarchical hyperbolic embeddings are superior for out-of-distribution recognition.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution recognition forms an important and well-studied problem
in deep learning, with the goal to filter out samples that do not belong to the
distribution on which a network has been trained. The conclusion of this paper
is simple: a good hierarchical hyperbolic embedding is preferred for
discriminating in- and out-of-distribution samples. We introduce Balanced
Hyperbolic Learning. We outline a hyperbolic class embedding algorithm that
jointly optimizes for hierarchical distortion and balancing between shallow and
wide subhierarchies. We then use the class embeddings as hyperbolic prototypes
for classification on in-distribution data. We outline how to generalize
existing out-of-distribution scoring functions to operate with hyperbolic
prototypes. Empirical evaluations across 13 datasets and 13 scoring functions
show that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform existing out-of-distribution
approaches when trained on the same data with the same backbones. We also show
that our hyperbolic embeddings outperform other hyperbolic approaches, beat
state-of-the-art contrastive methods, and natively enable hierarchical
out-of-distribution generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals a geometric regularity in diffusion-based generative models' sampling trajectories, showing they lie in low-dimensional subspaces and share a 'boomerang' shape. It proposes a dynamic programming-based scheme to optimize sampling time schedules, improving performance with minimal computational overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover and leverage the geometric regularity in deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion-based generative models, enhancing efficiency and performance.

Method: Analyzes sampling trajectories, characterizes their properties, and introduces a dynamic programming-based scheme to align sampling time schedules with trajectory structure.

Result: Demonstrates that trajectories are low-dimensional and uniform in shape, and the proposed scheme improves image generation, especially with few function evaluations.

Conclusion: The discovered trajectory regularity and the dynamic programming-based scheme offer a simple yet effective way to enhance sampling efficiency and performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models employ stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) and their equivalent probability flow ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) to establish a smooth transformation between complex high-dimensional
data distributions and tractable prior distributions. In this paper, we reveal
a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics: each
simulated sampling trajectory lies within an extremely low-dimensional
subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical ''boomerang'' shape,
regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content.
We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories,
particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data
modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered
trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better
align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This
simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing ODE-based numerical
solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image
generation performance, especially in regions with only $5 \sim 10$ function
evaluations.

*Alexander Lobashev,Dmitry Guskov,Maria Larchenko,Mikhail Tamm*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel method analyzes latent space geometry in generative models by reconstructing the Fisher information metric, validated on Ising and TASEP models, and revealing fractal phase transitions in diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complex structure of latent spaces in generative models, particularly diffusion models, and their connection to phenomena like phase transitions.

Method: Approximates the posterior distribution of latent variables to learn the log-partition function, defining the Fisher metric for exponential families, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: Outperforms baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities and reveals fractal phase transitions in diffusion models, with divergent Lipschitz constants at phase boundaries.

Conclusion: The method provides new insights into diffusion model latent spaces, highlighting their complex structure and connection to phase transitions.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for analyzing the latent space geometry of
generative models, including statistical physics models and diffusion models,
by reconstructing the Fisher information metric. The method approximates the
posterior distribution of latent variables given generated samples and uses
this to learn the log-partition function, which defines the Fisher metric for
exponential families. Theoretical convergence guarantees are provided, and the
method is validated on the Ising and TASEP models, outperforming existing
baselines in reconstructing thermodynamic quantities. Applied to diffusion
models, the method reveals a fractal structure of phase transitions in the
latent space, characterized by abrupt changes in the Fisher metric. We
demonstrate that while geodesic interpolations are approximately linear within
individual phases, this linearity breaks down at phase boundaries, where the
diffusion model exhibits a divergent Lipschitz constant with respect to the
latent space. These findings provide new insights into the complex structure of
diffusion model latent spaces and their connection to phenomena like phase
transitions. Our source code is available at

### [199] [ReGuidance: A Simple Diffusion Wrapper for Boosting Sample Quality on Hard Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10955)
*Aayush Karan,Kulin Shah,Sitan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReGuidance is a wrapper method to improve sample realism and reward in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, outperforming baselines in hard tasks like in-painting and super-resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training-free methods like DPS fail in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratios, producing unrealistic outputs.

Method: ReGuidance inverts a candidate solution using the unconditional probability flow ODE, then reinitializes DPS with the resulting latent.

Result: ReGuidance significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency in challenging tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: ReGuidance offers a theoretically backed solution to enhance DPS performance, ensuring better alignment with the data manifold and reward optimization.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models
as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around
steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion
posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic
algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough,
e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques
veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work,
we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism
and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$
produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the
solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting
from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for
DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box
in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art
baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these
baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We
complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data
distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the
candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this
constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

### [200] [Learning-based density-equalizing map](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10027)
*Yanwen Huang,Lok Ming Lui,Gary P. T. Choi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel learning-based density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks is proposed, outperforming traditional methods in accuracy, bijectivity, and scalability from 2D to 3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DEM methods face challenges like limited accuracy, overlapping artifacts, and difficulty extending from 2D to 3D. This work aims to address these issues with a learning-based approach.

Method: LDEM uses deep neural networks with a loss function enforcing density uniformity and geometric regularity, employing a hierarchical approach for coarse and dense-level transformations.

Result: LDEM shows superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties, generalizes seamlessly to 3D, and is effective for surface remeshing.

Conclusion: The work enables scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps, opening new possibilities for practical applications.

Abstract: Density-equalizing map (DEM) serves as a powerful technique for creating
shape deformations with the area changes reflecting an underlying density
function. In recent decades, DEM has found widespread applications in fields
such as data visualization, geometry processing, and medical imaging.
Traditional approaches to DEM primarily rely on iterative numerical solvers for
diffusion equations or optimization-based methods that minimize handcrafted
energy functionals. However, these conventional techniques often face several
challenges: they may suffer from limited accuracy, produce overlapping
artifacts in extreme cases, and require substantial algorithmic redesign when
extended from 2D to 3D, due to the derivative-dependent nature of their energy
formulations. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based
density-equalizing mapping framework (LDEM) using deep neural networks.
Specifically, we introduce a loss function that enforces density uniformity and
geometric regularity, and utilize a hierarchical approach to predict the
transformations at both the coarse and dense levels. Our method demonstrates
superior density-equalizing and bijectivity properties compared to prior
methods for a wide range of simple and complex density distributions, and can
be easily applied to surface remeshing with different effects. Also, it
generalizes seamlessly from 2D to 3D domains without structural changes to the
model architecture or loss formulation. Altogether, our work opens up new
possibilities for scalable and robust computation of density-equalizing maps
for practical applications.

### [201] [Low-Barrier Dataset Collection with Real Human Body for Interactive Per-Garment Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10468)
*Zaiqiang Wu,Yechen Li,Jingyuan Liu,Yuki Shibata,Takayuki Hori,I-Chao Shen,Takeo Igarashi*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A low-barrier method for virtual try-on uses real human bodies for dataset collection and improves garment alignment with a hybrid person representation, outperforming existing methods in quality and consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing virtual try-on methods are limited to front views, lack real-time performance, and rely on expensive robotic mannequins with inaccurate body deformation.

Method: Proposes using real human bodies for dataset collection and a hybrid person representation combining intermediate representation with a simplified DensePose map.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image quality and temporal consistency, with user studies confirming its usefulness for garment purchasing decisions.

Conclusion: The method addresses practical limitations of existing approaches and proves effective for virtual try-on applications.

Abstract: Existing image-based virtual try-on methods are often limited to the front
view and lack real-time performance. While per-garment virtual try-on methods
have tackled these issues by capturing per-garment datasets and training
per-garment neural networks, they still encounter practical limitations: (1)
the robotic mannequin used to capture per-garment datasets is prohibitively
expensive for widespread adoption and fails to accurately replicate natural
human body deformation; (2) the synthesized garments often misalign with the
human body. To address these challenges, we propose a low-barrier approach for
collecting per-garment datasets using real human bodies, eliminating the
necessity for a customized robotic mannequin. We also introduce a hybrid person
representation that enhances the existing intermediate representation with a
simplified DensePose map. This ensures accurate alignment of synthesized
garment images with the human body and enables human-garment interaction
without the need for customized wearable devices. We performed qualitative and
quantitative evaluations against other state-of-the-art image-based virtual
try-on methods and conducted ablation studies to demonstrate the superiority of
our method regarding image quality and temporal consistency. Finally, our user
study results indicated that most participants found our virtual try-on system
helpful for making garment purchasing decisions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Edit360 is a tuning-free framework for multi-view consistent 3D editing using 2D diffusion models, ensuring coherence across all viewpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending diffusion models to 3D editing is challenging, especially for fine-grained, multi-view consistent edits. Existing methods lack flexibility.

Method: Edit360 uses video diffusion models, anchor-view editing propagation, and latent/attention space alignment for multi-view consistency.

Result: Enables high-quality 3D asset reconstruction from edited multi-view sequences, supporting customizable 3D content creation.

Conclusion: Edit360 advances 3D editing by ensuring multi-view consistency and flexibility, overcoming limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image
generation and editing, but extending these capabilities to 3D assets remains
challenging, especially for fine-grained edits that require multi-view
consistency. Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined
viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications.
We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to
multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360
enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring
structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for
2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To
achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation
mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within
the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited
multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets,
enabling customizable 3D content creation.

*Chengxu Zuo,Jiawei Huang,Xiao Jiang,Yuan Yao,Xiangren Shi,Rui Cao,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo,Yipeng Qin*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: A novel dynamic calibration method for sparse inertial motion capture systems relaxes absolute static assumptions, enabling real-time estimation of coordinate drift and measurement offset with Transformer-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the restrictive absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, which limits application scenarios, by proposing a dynamic method.

Method: Uses relaxed assumptions (minor matrix changes in short windows and diverse human movements) and a Transformer-based model to estimate RG'G and RBS in real time.

Result: Achieves implicit IMU calibration and enables long-term, accurate motion capture with sparse IMUs.

Conclusion: The method expands IMU application scenarios and is the first to achieve implicit calibration and long-term accuracy with sparse IMUs.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic calibration method for sparse
inertial motion capture systems, which is the first to break the restrictive
absolute static assumption in IMU calibration, i.e., the coordinate drift RG'G
and measurement offset RBS remain constant during the entire motion, thereby
significantly expanding their application scenarios. Specifically, we achieve
real-time estimation of RG'G and RBS under two relaxed assumptions: i) the
matrices change negligibly in a short time window; ii) the human movements/IMU
readings are diverse in such a time window. Intuitively, the first assumption
reduces the number of candidate matrices, and the second assumption provides
diverse constraints, which greatly reduces the solution space and allows for
accurate estimation of RG'G and RBS from a short history of IMU readings in
real time. To achieve this, we created synthetic datasets of paired RG'G, RBS
matrices and IMU readings, and learned their mappings using a Transformer-based
model. We also designed a calibration trigger based on the diversity of IMU
readings to ensure that assumption ii) is met before applying our method. To
our knowledge, we are the first to achieve implicit IMU calibration (i.e.,
seamlessly putting IMUs into use without the need for an explicit calibration
process), as well as the first to enable long-term and accurate motion capture
using sparse IMUs. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: A modular VLN framework decouples vision-language understanding from action planning, using a frozen LVLM and lightweight logic for fast, adaptable navigation. Initial results show challenges in generalization but highlight scalability potential.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational cost and real-time deployment challenges in VLN by leveraging LVLMs without extensive fine-tuning.

Method: Integrates Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with lightweight planning, prompt engineering, structured history, and two-frame visual input for decision continuity.

Result: Tested on Room-to-Room benchmark; shows generalization challenges but proves modularity's scalability.

Conclusion: Modular approach is promising for efficient navigation, with future improvements possible via better environmental priors and multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied
AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate
through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large
vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly
improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to
computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a
modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language
understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language
model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to
achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model
fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history
management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making
continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room
benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and
Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal
challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation
settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient
navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement
through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input
integration.

Result: Produces scalable, interactive 3D worlds with accurate physics, supporting training and evaluation in embodied AI.

Conclusion: EmbodiedGen offers a cost-effective, realistic solution for 3D asset generation, advancing embodied intelligence research.

Abstract: Constructing a physically realistic and accurately scaled simulated 3D world
is crucial for the training and evaluation of embodied intelligence tasks. The

TL;DR: EyeRobot is a robotic system with gaze behavior trained via reinforcement learning to facilitate hand-eye coordination for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inspired by human active vision, the system aims to improve robotic manipulation by integrating gaze behavior with task completion.

Method: A mechanical eyeball is trained using a BC-RL loop, combining teleoperated demonstrations and simulation for joint hand-eye coordination.

Result: EyeRobot shows effective hand-eye coordination, stable fixation, and improved object tracking in panoramic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates the potential of active gaze behavior for enhancing robotic manipulation in large workspaces.

Abstract: Humans do not passively observe the visual world -- we actively look in order
to act. Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system
with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We
develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings
and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We
accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a
360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports
rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze
on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the
hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye
observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct
action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks
towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements
a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small
compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable
fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors.
We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring
manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest
EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate
manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera. See project site for

TL;DR: The paper introduces MAGIC, a modality-agnostic deep learning model for cardiac substructure segmentation, outperforming comparison models in accuracy and efficiency across multiple imaging modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of generalizability in deep learning for cardiac substructure segmentation across different imaging modalities and overlapping structures.

Method: MAGIC uses a replicated encoding and decoding nnU-Net-based backbone to segment 20 cardiac substructures from Sim-CT, MR-Linac, and CCTA modalities, validated against 12 comparison models.

Result: MAGIC achieved average DSC scores of 0.75 (Sim-CT), 0.68 (MR-Linac), and 0.80 (CCTA), outperforming comparisons in 57% of cases.

Conclusion: MAGIC is an efficient, lightweight solution for multi-modal cardiac segmentation, simplifying clinical implementation.

Abstract: Cardiac substructures are essential in thoracic radiation therapy planning to
minimize risk of radiation-induced heart disease. Deep learning (DL) offers
efficient methods to reduce contouring burden but lacks generalizability across
different modalities and overlapping structures. This work introduces and
validates a Modality-AGnostic Image Cascade (MAGIC) for comprehensive and
multi-modal cardiac substructure segmentation. MAGIC is implemented through
replicated encoding and decoding branches of an nnU-Net-based, U-shaped
backbone conserving the function of a single model. Twenty cardiac
substructures (heart, chambers, great vessels (GVs), valves, coronary arteries
(CAs), and conduction nodes) from simulation CT (Sim-CT), low-field MR-Linac,
and cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) modalities were manually delineated and used
to train (n=76), validate (n=15), and test (n=30) MAGIC. Twelve comparison
models (four segmentation subgroups across three modalities) were equivalently
trained. All methods were compared for training efficiency and against
reference contours using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and two-tailed
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (threshold, p<0.05). Average DSC scores were
0.75(0.16) for Sim-CT, 0.68(0.21) for MR-Linac, and 0.80(0.16) for CCTA. MAGIC
outperforms the comparison in 57% of cases, with limited statistical
differences. MAGIC offers an effective and accurate segmentation solution that
is lightweight and capable of segmenting multiple modalities and overlapping
structures in a single model. MAGIC further enables clinical implementation by
simplifying the computational requirements and offering unparalleled
flexibility for clinical settings.

Method: Analysis of over 50 research papers, identifying trends, limitations, and inconsistencies in evaluation metrics and datasets.

Result: Findings reveal dataset similarities and metric inconsistencies leading to overestimated performances. A new PLM-based model is released.

Conclusion: The paper provides a thorough review of keyphrase generation, identifies gaps, and introduces a model to aid future research.

Abstract: Keyphrase generation refers to the task of producing a set of words or
phrases that summarises the content of a document. Continuous efforts have been
dedicated to this task over the past few years, spreading across multiple lines
of research, such as model architectures, data resources, and use-case
scenarios. Yet, the current state of keyphrase generation remains unknown as
there has been no attempt to review and analyse previous work. In this paper,
we bridge this gap by presenting an analysis of over 50 research papers on
keyphrase generation, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress,
limitations, and open challenges. Our findings highlight several critical
issues in current evaluation practices, such as the concerning similarity among
commonly-used benchmark datasets and inconsistencies in metric calculations
leading to overestimated performances. Additionally, we address the limited
availability of pre-trained models by releasing a strong PLM-based model for
keyphrase generation as an effort to facilitate future research.

*Haoyuan Shi,Yunxin Li,Xinyu Chen,Longyue Wang,Baotian Hu,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: AniMaker is a multi-agent framework for generating coherent storytelling videos from text, using specialized agents and novel techniques like MCTS-Gen and AniEval to improve quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation methods produce disjointed narratives and pacing issues, and instability in models degrades coherence. AniMaker addresses these challenges.

Method: AniMaker employs specialized agents (Director, Photography, Reviewer, Post-Production) with MCTS-Gen for clip generation and AniEval for multi-shot evaluation.

Result: AniMaker outperforms in quality (VBench, AniEval) and efficiency, enhancing storytelling animation.

Conclusion: AniMaker advances AI-generated storytelling animation toward production standards by ensuring coherence and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent
storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains
challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into
fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues.
Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that
even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output
animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these
obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient
multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus
creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text
input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the
Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip
generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent
for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical
components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to
generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in
Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot
animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level
consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering
each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments
demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular
metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while
significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing
AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

*Rudy Alexandro Garrido Veliz,Martin Semmann,Chris Biemann,Seid Muhie Yimam*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: The paper introduces a neo-fascist coding scheme for digital discourse, bridging NLP and political science, and tests it on data from neo-fascist forums, achieving the first classification models for such content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neo-fascism's rise threatens democracy and minorities, necessitating tools to detect and counteract its discourse.

Method: Developed a coding scheme, collected and annotated forum posts, and fine-tuned SLMs and LLMs for classification.

Result: Prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric confirmed; first classification models for neo-fascist discourse created.

Conclusion: Continued research and action against neo-fascist discourse are vital for democratic societies.

Abstract: Neo-fascism is a political and societal ideology that has been having
remarkable growth in the last decade in the United States of America (USA), as
well as in other Western societies. It poses a grave danger to democracy and
the minorities it targets, and it requires active actions against it to avoid
escalation. This work presents the first-of-its-kind neo-fascist coding scheme
for digital discourse in the USA societal context, overseen by political
science researchers. Our work bridges the gap between Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and political science against this phenomena. Furthermore, to
test the coding scheme, we collect a tremendous amount of activity on the
internet from notable neo-fascist groups (the forums of Iron March and
Stormfront.org), and the guidelines are applied to a subset of the collected
posts. Through crowdsourcing, we annotate a total of a thousand posts that are
labeled as neo-fascist or non-neo-fascist. With this labeled data set, we
fine-tune and test both Small Language Models (SLMs) and Large Language Models
(LLMs), obtaining the very first classification models for neo-fascist
discourse. We find that the prevalence of neo-fascist rhetoric in this kind of
forum is ever-present, making them a good target for future research. The
societal context is a key consideration for neo-fascist speech when conducting

Motivation: To provide a unified perspective on the evolution of MLLMs, their cross-modal capabilities, and the foundational techniques enabling them, while identifying open challenges for future research.

Method: Categorizes six generative modalities and examines key techniques (SSL, MoE, RLHF, CoT) and architectural innovations (transformers, diffusion models) that enable cross-modal capabilities.

Result: Identifies trends in MLLM development, emergent cross-modal synergies, and transferable techniques, alongside unresolved challenges in evaluation, modularity, and reasoning.

Conclusion: The survey outlines critical paths for advancing MLLMs toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text
generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music,
video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory
modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary
generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends,
and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques
and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and
diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and
modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify
open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This
survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical
paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal
systems.

### [213] [EQ-TAA: Equivariant Traffic Accident Anticipation via Diffusion-Based Accident Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10002)
*Jianwu Fang,Lei-Lei Li,Zhedong Zheng,Hongkai Yu,Jianru Xue,Zhengguo Li,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model to synthesize accident video clips for Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA), addressing data bias and background confounding issues. It introduces EQ-TAA with an equivariant triple loss, achieving competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TAA methods suffer from data bias and background confounding due to the long-tailed, uncertain nature of traffic scenes. The need for laborious annotations and difficulty in identifying causal parts of accidents motivates the proposed solution.

Method: The AVD model generates causal video frames from normal to accident clips using text prompts, preserving style and content. EQ-TAA uses an equivariant triple loss with pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips for training.

Result: AVD and EQ-TAA achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, validated through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: The proposed AVD and EQ-TAA effectively address TAA challenges by synthesizing accident clips and leveraging equivariant learning, offering a promising direction for zero-fatality goals.

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging
problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches
typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious
annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed,
uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real
causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by
data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an
Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident
video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal
clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on
accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content
of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using
datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations.
Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant
triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated
pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA,
and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been
obtained.

### [214] [HER2 Expression Prediction with Flexible Multi-Modal Inputs via Dynamic Bidirectional Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10006)
*Jie Qin,Wei Yang,Yan Su,Yiran Zhu,Weizhen Li,Yunyue Pan,Chengchang Pan,Honggang Qi*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper proposes an adaptive bimodal framework for HER2 prediction in breast cancer, improving accuracy and reliability with flexible single-/dual-modality inputs, while reducing costs and computational demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HER2 assessment models analyze H&E or IHC images separately, missing the clinical benefit of their combined use. Workflow and cost challenges hinder concurrent acquisition of both modalities.

Method: The framework includes: 1) A dynamic branch selector for input-based modality handling, 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN for feature-space reconstruction, and 3) A hybrid training protocol combining adversarial learning and multi-task optimization.

Result: Single-modality H&E accuracy rose from 71.44% to 94.25%, dual-modality accuracy reached 95.09%, and IHC-only reliability was 90.28%. Cross-modal reconstruction improved F1-scores (0.9609 for HE to IHC, 0.9251 for IHC to HE).

Conclusion: The framework offers near-bimodal performance without synchronized acquisition, reducing costs and democratizing HER2 assessment, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&E or
IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic
interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often
hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive
bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction
through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either
single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input
completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware
feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training
protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This
architecture elevates single-modality H&E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to
94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28%
reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred,
single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring
synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings
through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms
22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&E/IHC baselines respectively, with
cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251
(IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or
native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from
missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter
reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates
significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse
healthcare settings.

### [215] [Controllable Expressive 3D Facial Animation via Diffusion in a Unified Multimodal Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10007)
*Kangwei Liu,Junwu Liu,Xiaowei Yi,Jinlin Guo,Yun Cao*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework for expressive 3D facial animation addresses challenges of single-modal control and deterministic mapping by using multimodal emotion binding and an attention-based latent diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of single-modal control signals and deterministic regression-based mapping in emotional 3D facial animation.

Method: FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding and an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers.

Result: Outperforms existing methods with a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while maintaining natural facial dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances expressiveness and flexibility in 3D facial animation by leveraging multimodal signals and stochastic modeling.

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant
challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or
emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for
comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based
mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and
non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To
address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for
controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that
aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive
learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and
(2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and
emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining
temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most
metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving
physiologically plausible facial dynamics. Project Page:

### [216] [Structured Graph Representations for Visual Narrative Reasoning: A Hierarchical Framework for Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10008)
*Yi-Chun Chen*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: A hierarchical knowledge graph framework for understanding visual narratives in comics, decomposing content into levels and integrating semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable structured understanding and reasoning over visual narratives in multimodal media like comics.

Method: Decomposes narratives into macro and fine-grained levels, representing them via integrated knowledge graphs. Multimodal graphs link visual and textual elements at the panel level.

Result: Applied to Manga109, the framework supports tasks like action retrieval and dialogue tracing with high precision and recall.

Conclusion: Provides a scalable foundation for narrative analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal reasoning in visual media.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the
structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media
such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple
levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It
represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic,
spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct
multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and
actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions.
These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over
story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset
and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse
narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character
appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show
high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and
interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation
for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal
reasoning in visual media.

### [217] [WDMIR: Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10011)
*Weiyin Gong,Kai Zhang,Yanghai Zhang,Qi Liu,Xinjie Sun,Junyu Lu,Linbo Zhu*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: The paper introduces WDMIR, a wavelet-driven framework for multimodal intent recognition, improving accuracy by leveraging frequency-domain analysis of non-verbal cues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods focus on text, neglecting non-verbal cues. This work aims to enhance intent recognition by integrating video, audio, and text with wavelet-driven fusion.

Method: Proposes (1) wavelet-driven fusion for synchronized video-audio feature decomposition and (2) cross-modal interaction for progressive feature enhancement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods by 1.13% accuracy on MIntRec. Ablation shows 0.41% improvement in recognizing subtle emotional cues.

Conclusion: WDMIR effectively bridges the semantic gap between verbal and non-verbal information, demonstrating superior performance in multimodal intent recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user
intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio
and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they
often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This
paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR)
framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis
of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a
wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and
integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling
fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction
mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to
trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and
non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by
1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven
fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information
from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when
analyzing subtle emotional cues.
