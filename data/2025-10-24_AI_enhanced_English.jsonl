There have been many works\nassessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark\nforging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and\napplied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we\ninvestigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image\nwatermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a\npreference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is\ntrained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without\nany need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to\nremove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through\nbackpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and\nworks without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much\nsimpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work.
