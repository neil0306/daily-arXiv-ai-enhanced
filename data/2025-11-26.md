### [1] [Efficient Multi-Hop Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs via LLM Planning and Embedding-Guided Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19648)
*Manil Shrestha,Edward Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hybrid algorithms combining LLM-guided planning and embedding-based neural search for efficient, verifiable multi-hop QA over knowledge graphs, achieving high accuracy with 100x speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational challenges and lack of verifiability in multi-hop QA over knowledge graphs, where current LLM-based approaches are inefficient and produce ungrounded answers.

Method: Two complementary approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Planning with single LLM call for relation sequence prediction executed via BFS, (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search using 6.7M-parameter edge scorer fusing text and graph embeddings without LLM calls.

Result: Achieved micro-F1 > 0.90 with grounded answers, 100x speedup, and successfully distilled planning capability into 4B-parameter model matching large-model performance at zero API cost.

Conclusion: Verifiable multi-hop reasoning doesn't require massive models but the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation.

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs remains computationally challenging due to the combinatorial explosion of possible reasoning paths. Recent approaches rely on expensive Large Language Model (LLM) inference for both entity linking and path ranking, limiting their practical deployment. Additionally, LLM-generated answers often lack verifiable grounding in structured knowledge. We present two complementary hybrid algorithms that address both efficiency and verifiability: (1) LLM-Guided Planning that uses a single LLM call to predict relation sequences executed via breadth-first search, achieving near-perfect accuracy (micro-F1 > 0.90) while ensuring all answers are grounded in the knowledge graph, and (2) Embedding-Guided Neural Search that eliminates LLM calls entirely by fusing text and graph embeddings through a lightweight 6.7M-parameter edge scorer, achieving over 100 times speedup with competitive accuracy. Through knowledge distillation, we compress planning capability into a 4B-parameter model that matches large-model performance at zero API cost. Evaluation on MetaQA demonstrates that grounded reasoning consistently outperforms ungrounded generation, with structured planning proving more transferable than direct answer generation. Our results show that verifiable multi-hop reasoning does not require massive models at inference time, but rather the right architectural inductive biases combining symbolic structure with learned representations.

### [2] [Can LLMs Faithfully Explain Themselves in Low-Resource Languages? A Case Study on Emotion Detection in Persian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19719)
*Mobina Mehrazar,Mohammad Amin Yousefi,Parisa Abolfath Beygi,Behnam Bahrak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM-generated explanations in Persian emotion classification show poor faithfulness, with models agreeing more with each other than human judgments, despite good classification performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in low-resource languages like Persian, where concerns exist about whether explanations reflect actual reasoning.

Method: Compare LLM-identified influential words with human annotations in Persian emotion classification, using confidence scores from token-level log-probabilities and testing two prompting strategies (Predict-then-Explain vs Explain-then-Predict).

Result: LLMs achieve strong classification performance but generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater inter-model agreement than alignment with human judgments.

Conclusion: Current explanation methods and metrics have limitations, highlighting need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate self-explanations alongside their predictions, a practice that raises concerns about the faithfulness of these explanations, especially in low-resource languages. This study evaluates the faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in the context of emotion classification in Persian, a low-resource language, by comparing the influential words identified by the model against those identified by human annotators. We assess faithfulness using confidence scores derived from token-level log-probabilities. Two prompting strategies, differing in the order of explanation and prediction (Predict-then-Explain and Explain-then-Predict), are tested for their impact on explanation faithfulness. Our results reveal that while LLMs achieve strong classification performance, their generated explanations often diverge from faithful reasoning, showing greater agreement with each other than with human judgments. These results highlight the limitations of current explanation methods and metrics, emphasizing the need for more robust approaches to ensure LLM reliability in multilingual and low-resource contexts.

### [3] [Comparative Analysis of LoRA-Adapted Embedding Models for Clinical Cardiology Text Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19739)
*Richard J. Young,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Encoder-only models like BioLinkBERT outperform larger decoder models for cardiology text embeddings using LoRA fine-tuning, challenging the assumption that bigger models are always better for domain-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a lack of systematic comparisons of transformer-based embedding models for clinical NLP, particularly in cardiology, where domain-specific embeddings are crucial but model architecture trade-offs are not well understood.

Method: Fine-tuned ten transformer-based models using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on 106,535 cardiology text pairs from medical textbooks, comparing encoder-only vs decoder-based architectures.

Result: Encoder-only architectures, especially BioLinkBERT, achieved superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) while requiring significantly fewer computational resources than larger decoder models.

Conclusion: Larger language models don't necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings; encoder-only architectures are more efficient and effective for clinical NLP tasks, with all models and code made publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Domain-specific text embeddings are critical for clinical natural language processing, yet systematic comparisons across model architectures remain limited. This study evaluates ten transformer-based embedding models adapted for cardiology through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on 106,535 cardiology text pairs derived from authoritative medical textbooks. Results demonstrate that encoder-only architectures, particularly BioLinkBERT, achieve superior domain-specific performance (separation score: 0.510) compared to larger decoder-based models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources. The findings challenge the assumption that larger language models necessarily produce better domain-specific embeddings and provide practical guidance for clinical NLP system development. All models, training code, and evaluation datasets are publicly available to support reproducible research in medical informatics.

### [4] [What does it mean to understand language?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19757)
*Colton Casto,Anna Ivanova,Evelina Fedorenko,Nancy Kanwisher*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Language understanding requires exporting information from the brain's language system to other regions for rich mental model construction, due to fundamental processing limitations in the core language system.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain that true language understanding goes beyond surface-level meaning extraction and requires constructing comprehensive mental models of described situations.

Method: Review existing evidence and propose using recent cognitive neuroscience advances to test the hypothesis that language understanding involves information export from language regions to other brain areas.

Result: The paper presents a conceptual framework where perceptual, motor, memory, and world knowledge systems contribute to deep language comprehension beyond core language processing.

Conclusion: Recent cognitive neuroscience progress provides tools to directly test this hypothesis, offering a new strategy to uncover the cognitive and neural basis of language understanding.

Abstract: Language understanding entails not just extracting the surface-level meaning of the linguistic input, but constructing rich mental models of the situation it describes. Here we propose that because processing within the brain's core language system is fundamentally limited, deeply understanding language requires exporting information from the language system to other brain regions that compute perceptual and motor representations, construct mental models, and store our world knowledge and autobiographical memories. We review the existing evidence for this hypothesis, and argue that recent progress in cognitive neuroscience provides both the conceptual foundation and the methods to directly test it, thus opening up a new strategy to reveal what it means, cognitively and neurally, to understand language.

### [5] [Gender Bias in Emotion Recognition by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19785)
*Maureen Herbert,Katie Sun,Angelica Lim,Yasaman Etesam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper examines gender bias in LLMs' emotional theory of mind and shows that training-based interventions are more effective than prompt engineering for debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become more integrated into daily life, it's crucial to evaluate and ensure their fairness, particularly regarding gender bias in emotional understanding.

Method: The study investigates whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when asked how a person feels based on descriptions, and evaluates various debiasing strategies including prompt engineering and training-based interventions.

Result: The research demonstrates that meaningful bias reduction requires training-based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches.

Conclusion: Achieving substantial fairness improvements in LLMs' emotional theory of mind necessitates training-based debiasing methods rather than just prompt engineering techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and their growing integration into daily life underscore the importance of evaluating and ensuring their fairness. In this work, we examine fairness within the domain of emotional theory of mind, investigating whether LLMs exhibit gender biases when presented with a description of a person and their environment and asked, "How does this person feel?". Furthermore, we propose and evaluate several debiasing strategies, demonstrating that achieving meaningful reductions in bias requires training based interventions rather than relying solely on inference-time prompt-based approaches such as prompt engineering.

### [6] [Breaking Bad: Norms for Valence, Arousal, and Dominance for over 10k English Multiword Expressions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19816)
*Saif M. Mohammad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper presents NRC VAD Lexicon v2, an expanded version with human ratings for 10k multiword expressions and 25k words, improving coverage and reliability for valence, arousal, and dominance dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To complement existing VAD lexicons by adding ratings for multiword expressions and increasing coverage of modern vocabulary, enabling better analysis of emotional characteristics in language.

Method: Created human ratings for valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English multiword expressions and their constituent words, while expanding unigram coverage with contemporary vocabulary.

Result: The lexicon now contains 10k MWEs and 25k words with highly reliable associations, enabling analysis of emotional characteristics and compositionality in multiword expressions.

Conclusion: The expanded lexicon supports diverse research applications in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences, and is freely available for use.

Abstract: Factor analysis studies have shown that the primary dimensions of word meaning are Valence (V), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Existing lexicons such as the NRC VAD Lexicon, published in 2018, include VAD association ratings for words. Here, we present a complement to it, which has human ratings of valence, arousal, and dominance for 10k English Multiword Expressions (MWEs) and their constituent words. We also increase the coverage of unigrams, especially words that have become more common since 2018. In all, the new NRC VAD Lexicon v2 now has entries for 10k MWEs and 25k words, in addition to the entries in v1. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicon to examine emotional characteristics of MWEs, including: 1. The degree to which MWEs (idioms, noun compounds, and verb particle constructions) exhibit strong emotionality; 2. The degree of emotional compositionality in MWEs. The lexicon enables a wide variety of research in NLP, Psychology, Public Health, Digital Humanities, and Social Sciences. The NRC VAD Lexicon v2 is freely available through the project webpage: http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/nrc-vad.html

### [7] [Language-Independent Sentiment Labelling with Distant Supervision: A Case Study for English, Sepedi and Setswana](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19818)
*Koena Ronny Mabokela,Tim Schlippe,Mpho Raborife,Turgay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Automatic sentiment labeling method using emojis and sentiment words for low-resource African languages, achieving 66% accuracy for English, 69% for Sepedi, and 63% for Setswana tweets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of labeled sentiment data for African languages by reducing manual labeling effort through automated processes.

Method: Language-independent sentiment labeling leveraging sentiment-bearing emojis and words from tweets in SAfriSenti corpus.

Result: 66% accuracy for English, 69% for Sepedi, 63% for Setswana tweets, requiring only 34% manual correction on average.

Conclusion: The approach effectively reduces manual labeling effort for low-resource languages while maintaining reasonable accuracy.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a helpful task to automatically analyse opinions and emotions on various topics in areas such as AI for Social Good, AI in Education or marketing. While many of the sentiment analysis systems are developed for English, many African languages are classified as low-resource languages due to the lack of digital language resources like text labelled with corresponding sentiment classes. One reason for that is that manually labelling text data is time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, automatic and rapid processes are needed to reduce the manual effort as much as possible making the labelling process as efficient as possible. In this paper, we present and analyze an automatic language-independent sentiment labelling method that leverages information from sentiment-bearing emojis and words. Our experiments are conducted with tweets in the languages English, Sepedi and Setswana from SAfriSenti, a multilingual sentiment corpus for South African languages. We show that our sentiment labelling approach is able to label the English tweets with an accuracy of 66%, the Sepedi tweets with 69%, and the Setswana tweets with 63%, so that on average only 34% of the automatically generated labels remain to be corrected.

### [8] [Profile-LLM: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19852)
*Shi-Wei Dai,Yan-Wei Shie,Tsung-Huan Yang,Lun-Wei Ku,Yung-Hui Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaPulse is a framework that optimizes prompts to maximize personality expression in LLMs using iterative enhancement and situational response benchmarks for realistic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous studies used prompts to elicit personality traits in LLMs but didn't optimize them to maximize personality expression, creating a gap in achieving realistic personality modeling.

Method: Leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while using a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool for contextually grounded evaluation.

Result: Quantitative evaluations show PersonaPulse-generated prompts outperform prior work based on psychological descriptions. Experiments reveal model size affects personality modeling, and optimization can be controlled for certain traits.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization is crucial for shaping personality expression in LLMs, providing insights for future adaptive AI interaction research.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be an effective way to create more engaging and enjoyable user-AI interactions. While previous studies have explored using prompts to elicit specific personality traits in LLMs, they have not optimized these prompts to maximize personality expression. To address this limitation, we propose PersonaPulse: Dynamic Profile Optimization for Realistic Personality Expression in LLMs, a framework that leverages LLMs' inherent knowledge of personality traits to iteratively enhance role-play prompts while integrating a situational response benchmark as a scoring tool, ensuring a more realistic and contextually grounded evaluation to guide the optimization process. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the prompts generated by PersonaPulse outperform those of prior work, which were designed based on personality descriptions from psychological studies. Additionally, we explore the relationship between model size and personality modeling through extensive experiments. Finally, we find that, for certain personality traits, the extent of personality evocation can be partially controlled by pausing the optimization process. These findings underscore the importance of prompt optimization in shaping personality expression within LLMs, offering valuable insights for future research on adaptive AI interactions.

### [9] [A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models with RAG-enabled Dynamic Prompting for Medical Error Detection and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19858)
*Farzad Ahmed,Joniel Augustine Jerome,Meliha Yetisgen,Özlem Uzuner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RDP outperforms zero-shot and static prompting for medical error detection and correction, reducing false positives by 15% and improving recall by 5-10%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical documentation errors compromise patient safety, and LLMs may help detect/correct them, but their performance under different prompting strategies is unclear.

Method: Evaluated 9 LLMs on MEDEC dataset using zero-shot, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.

Result: RDP reduced FPR by ~15%, improved recall by 5-10% in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections compared to other methods.

Conclusion: RDP outperforms other prompting strategies across diverse LLMs, improving detection accuracy, reducing false positives, and enhancing reliability of medical error correction.

Abstract: Objective: Clinical documentation contains factual, diagnostic, and management errors that can compromise patient safety. Large language models (LLMs) may help detect and correct such errors, but their behavior under different prompting strategies remains unclear. We evaluate zero-shot prompting, static prompting with random exemplars (SPR), and retrieval-augmented dynamic prompting (RDP) for three subtasks of medical error processing: error flag detection, error sentence detection, and error correction.
  Methods: Using the MEDEC dataset, we evaluated nine instruction-tuned LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI o-series models). We measured performance using accuracy, recall, false-positive rate (FPR), and an aggregate score of ROUGE-1, BLEURT, and BERTScore for error correction. We also analyzed example outputs to identify failure modes and differences between LLM and clinician reasoning.
  Results: Zero-shot prompting showed low recall in both detection tasks, often missing abbreviation-heavy or atypical errors. SPR improved recall but increased FPR. Across all nine LLMs, RDP reduced FPR by about 15 percent, improved recall by 5 to 10 percent in error sentence detection, and generated more contextually accurate corrections.
  Conclusion: Across diverse LLMs, RDP outperforms zero-shot and SPR prompting. Using retrieved exemplars improves detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and enhances the reliability of medical error correction.

### [10] [AppSelectBench: Application-Level Tool Selection Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19957)
*Tianyi Chen,Michael Solodko,Sen Wang,Jongwoo Ko,Junheng Hao,Colby Banbury,Sara Abdali,Saeed Amizadeh,Qing Xiao,Yinheng Li,Tianyu Ding,Kamran Ghasedi Dizaji,Suzhen Zheng,Hao Fan,Justin Wagle,Pashmina Cameron,Kazuhito Koishida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AppSelectBench is a new benchmark for evaluating application selection in Computer Using Agents (CUAs), addressing the gap in assessing models' ability to reason across and choose between different applications rather than just fine-grained API selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection but offer limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications, which is fundamental for CUAs to operate effectively by initializing correct environments and avoiding orchestration confusion.

Method: Introduced AppSelectBench with a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, covering 100 widely used desktop applications and over 100,000 user tasks. Includes unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented settings.

Result: Extensive experiments across closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices.

Conclusion: AppSelectBench establishes a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

Abstract: Computer Using Agents (CUAs) are increasingly equipped with external tools, enabling them to perform complex and realistic tasks. For CUAs to operate effectively, application selection, which refers to deciding which application to use before invoking fine-grained tools such as APIs, is a fundamental capability. It determines whether the agent initializes the correct environment, avoids orchestration confusion, and efficiently focuses on relevant context. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess fine-grained API selection, offering limited insight into whether models can reason across and choose between different applications. To fill this gap, we introduce AppSelectBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating application selection in CUAs. AppSelectBench contains a novel user task generation pipeline that produces realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user intents at scale, together with unified evaluation protocols covering random, heuristic, zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented-settings. AppSelectBench covers one hundred widely used desktop applications and includes more than one hundred thousand realistic, diverse, and semantically grounded user tasks. Extensive experiments across both closed-source and open-source large language models reveal systematic strengths and weaknesses in inter-application reasoning, showing that even the most capable models still struggle to make consistent application choices. Together, these results establish AppSelectBench as a foundation for studying and advancing application level reasoning, an essential yet underexplored capability of intelligent CUAs.

### [11] [$\text{R}^2\text{R}$: A Route-to-Rerank Post-Training Framework for Multi-Domain Decoder-Only Rerankers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19987)
*Xinyu Wang,Hanwei Wu,Qingchen Hu,Zhenghan Tai,Jingrui Tian,Lei Ding,Jijun Chi,Hailin He,Tung Sum Thomas Kwok,Yufei Cui,Sicheng Lyu,Muzhi Li,Mingze Li,Xinyue Yu,Ling Zhou,Peng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R2R is a domain-aware reranking framework that uses dynamic expert routing and Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG) to prevent surface-form overfitting and improve cross-domain robustness in high-stakes fields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalist rerankers miss domain-specific nuances in critical fields like finance and law, while naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Uses dynamic expert routing with two-stage EAG training that masks predictive surface cues, and a lightweight Latent Semantic Router to select optimal LoRA experts per query from frozen backbone.

Result: Consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines across legal, medical, and financial domains with different reranker backbones.

Conclusion: R2R is a model-agnostic, modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.

Abstract: Decoder-only rerankers are central to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). However, generalist models miss domain-specific nuances in high-stakes fields like finance and law, and naive fine-tuning causes surface-form overfitting and catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we introduce R2R, a domain-aware framework that combines dynamic expert routing with a two-stage training strategy, Entity Abstraction for Generalization (EAG). EAG introduces a counter-shortcut mechanism by masking the most predictive surface cues, forcing the reranker to learn domain-invariant relevance patterns rather than memorizing dataset-specific entities. To efficiently activate domain experts, R2R employs a lightweight Latent Semantic Router that probes internal representations from the frozen backbone decoder to select the optimal LoRA expert per query. Extensive experiments across different reranker backbones and diverse domains (legal, medical, and financial) demonstrate that R2R consistently surpasses generalist and single-domain fine-tuned baselines. Our results confirm that R2R is a model-agnostic and modular approach to domain specialization with strong cross-domain robustness.

### [12] [Directional Optimization Asymmetry in Transformers: A Synthetic Stress Test](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19997)
*Mihir Sahasrabudhe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformers exhibit a 'reversal curse' - they learn forward mappings much better than inverse mappings, even on synthetic data without linguistic biases, revealing an intrinsic directional optimization gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve whether directional failures in Transformers stem from linguistic statistics or the architecture itself, by testing on synthetic data that removes real-world biases.

Method: Created a synthetic benchmark with random string mappings, using tunable branching factor K to construct forward tasks (zero conditional entropy) and inverse tasks (analytically determined entropy floors). Trained GPT-2 models from scratch and with pre-training, comparing against MLP baselines.

Result: Found a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (1.16 nats at K=5) where Transformers perform much worse on inverse mappings. Pre-training shifts but doesn't eliminate the gap, and LoRA hits capacity limits on high-entropy inverses.

Conclusion: Transformers have an intrinsic directional friction that persists even when linguistic priors and corpus asymmetries are removed, making inversion fundamentally harder for the architecture.

Abstract: Transformers are theoretically reversal-invariant: their function class does not prefer left-to-right over right-to-left mappings. Yet empirical studies on natural language repeatedly report a "reversal curse," and recent work on temporal asymmetry in LLMs suggests that real-world corpora carry their own arrow of time. This leaves an unresolved question: do directional failures stem from linguistic statistics, or from the architecture itself? We cut through this ambiguity with a fully synthetic, entropy-controlled benchmark designed as a clean-room stress test for directional learning. Using random string mappings with tunable branching factor K, we construct forward tasks with zero conditional entropy and inverse tasks with analytically determined entropy floors. Excess loss above these floors reveals that even scratch-trained GPT-2 models exhibit a strong, reproducible directional optimization gap (e.g., 1.16 nats at K=5), far larger than that of an MLP trained on the same data. Pre-trained initializations shift optimization behavior but do not eliminate this gap, while LoRA encounters a sharp capacity wall on high-entropy inverse mappings. Together, these results isolate a minimal, semantics-free signature of directional friction intrinsic to causal Transformer training-one that persists even when linguistic priors, token frequencies, and corpus-level temporal asymmetries are removed. Our benchmark provides a controlled instrument for dissecting directional biases in modern sequence models and motivates deeper mechanistic study of why inversion remains fundamentally harder for Transformers.

### [13] [A Machine Learning Approach for Detection of Mental Health Conditions and Cyberbullying from Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20001)
*Edward Ajayi,Martha Kachweka,Mawuli Deku,Emily Aiken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified multiclass classification framework for detecting 10 mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media using domain-adapted transformers, achieving high accuracy with ethical human-in-the-loop implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the growing prevalence of mental health challenges and cyberbullying in digital spaces by creating scalable, interpretable detection systems for social media content.

Method: Curated datasets from Twitter and Reddit using split-then-balance pipeline, compared lexical models, hybrid approaches, and fine-tuned transformers including domain-adapted MentalBERT, with hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework.

Result: MentalBERT achieved best performance with 0.92 accuracy and 0.76 Macro F1 score, outperforming generic transformers and zero-shot LLM baseline. Prototype dashboard "Social Media Screener" developed for practical implementation.

Conclusion: End-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with domain-adapted models showing superiority. Framework serves as human-in-the-loop screening aid, highlighting need for multi-label clinically-validated datasets in online safety and mental health intersection.

Abstract: Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.

*Huiyu Bai,Runze Wang,Zhuoyun Du,Yiyang Zhao,Fengji Zhang,Haoyu Chen,Xiaoyong Zhu,Bo Zheng,Xuejiao Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Online-PVLM enables real-time concept learning for personalized VLMs using hyperbolic representations, eliminating the need for separate embeddings per concept and supporting scalable online adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing personalized VLM methods require learning separate embeddings for each new concept, which doesn't support real-time adaptation during testing and fails to scale efficiently in large-scale scenarios.

Method: Proposed Online-PVLM framework using hyperbolic representations for train-free concept embeddings generation at test time, enabling online concept learning without separate embedding training.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on OP-Eval benchmark (1,292 concepts, 30K+ instances), demonstrating scalable and efficient online concept learning.

Conclusion: Online-PVLM provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-time concept learning in personalized VLMs, with the framework and comprehensive benchmark enabling future research in this area.

Abstract: Personalized Visual Language Models (VLMs) are gaining increasing attention for their formidable ability in user-specific concepts aligned interactions (e.g., identifying a user's bike). Existing methods typically require the learning of separate embeddings for each new concept, which fails to support real-time adaptation during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced in large-scale scenarios, where efficient retrieval of concept embeddings is not achievable. To alleviate this gap, we propose Online-PVLM, a framework for online concept learning by leveraging hyperbolic representations. Our approach makes a train-free paradigm for concept embeddings generation at test time, making the use of personalized VLMs both scalable and efficient. In addition, we develop OP-Eval, a comprehensive and large-scale benchmark comprising 1,292 concepts and over 30K high-quality instances with diverse question types, designed to rigorously assess online concept learning in realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed framework. Our source code and dataset will be made available.

Conclusion: MTA provides an effective solution for scalable and flexible personalization in LLMs, eliminating user-specific storage requirements and enabling efficient adaptation even with sparse user data.

Abstract: Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs) aim to align model outputs with individual user preferences, a crucial capability for user-centric applications. However, the prevalent approach of fine-tuning a separate module for each user faces two major limitations: (1) storage costs scale linearly with the number of users, rendering the method unscalable; and (2) fine-tuning a static model from scratch often yields suboptimal performance for users with sparse data. To address these challenges, we propose MTA, a Merge-then-Adapt framework for PLLMs. MTA comprises three key stages. First, we construct a shared Meta-LoRA Bank by selecting anchor users and pre-training meta-personalization traits within meta-LoRA modules. Second, to ensure scalability and enable dynamic personalization combination beyond static models, we introduce an Adaptive LoRA Fusion stage. This stage retrieves and dynamically merges the most relevant anchor meta-LoRAs to synthesize a user-specific one, thereby eliminating the need for user-specific storage and supporting more flexible personalization. Third, we propose a LoRA Stacking for Few-Shot Personalization stage, which applies an additional ultra-low-rank, lightweight LoRA module on top of the merged LoRA. Fine-tuning this module enables effective personalization under few-shot settings. Extensive experiments on the LaMP benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing SOTA methods across multiple tasks.

*Duc Anh Vu,Thong Nguyen,Cong-Duy Nguyen,Viet Anh Nguyen,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiasPrompting is a novel inference framework that improves LLM performance on multiple-choice questions by generating and evaluating reasoning for all answer options before final prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches present answer choices to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation, leading to incomplete exploration of options and degraded reasoning capabilities.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) reasoning generation where LLMs produce supportive reasoning for each answer option, 2) reasoning-guided agreement where generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer.

Result: Significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks, particularly enhancing performance in challenging settings where existing methods underperform.

Conclusion: BiasPrompting enhances LLM reasoning capabilities and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex multiple-choice questions through comprehensive option evaluation.

Abstract: With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), their performance on multiple-choice question (MCQ) tasks has improved significantly. However, existing approaches face key limitations: answer choices are typically presented to LLMs without contextual grounding or explanation. This absence of context can lead to incomplete exploration of all possible answers, ultimately degrading the models' reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce BiasPrompting, a novel inference framework that guides LLMs to generate and critically evaluate reasoning across all plausible answer options before reaching a final prediction. It consists of two components: first, a reasoning generation stage, where the model is prompted to produce supportive reasonings for each answer option, and then, a reasoning-guided agreement stage, where the generated reasonings are synthesized to select the most plausible answer. Through comprehensive evaluations, BiasPrompting demonstrates significant improvements in five widely used multiple-choice question answering benchmarks. Our experiments showcase that BiasPrompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and provides a strong foundation for tackling complex and challenging questions, particularly in settings where existing methods underperform.

### [17] [SSA: Sparse Sparse Attention by Aligning Full and Sparse Attention Outputs in Feature Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20102)
*Zhenyi Shen,Junru Lu,Lin Gui,Jiazheng Li,Yulan He,Di Yin,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SSA is a unified training framework that addresses gradient deficiency in sparse attention by enforcing bidirectional alignment between sparse and full attention, achieving state-of-the-art performance and enabling flexible compute-performance trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attention methods suffer from a paradox where they produce lower sparsity than full attention despite aiming to approximate it, due to gradient update deficiency where excluded key-value pairs never learn proper suppression.

Method: SSA considers both sparse and full attention simultaneously and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer, preserving gradient flow to all tokens while encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with full-attention counterparts.

Result: SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple benchmarks, enables smooth adaptation to varying sparsity budgets, and demonstrates the strongest long-context extrapolation capability by mitigating attention over-allocation in sink areas.

Conclusion: SSA successfully overcomes the limitations of existing sparse attention methods by addressing gradient deficiency through bidirectional alignment, enabling efficient long-context processing with flexible performance-compute trade-offs and improved extrapolation capabilities.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of full attention limits efficient long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). Sparse attention mitigates this cost by restricting each query to attend to a subset of previous tokens; however, training-free approaches often lead to severe performance degradation. Native sparse-attention methods (e.g., NSA, MoBA) alleviate this issue, yet exhibit a critical paradox: they produce lower attention sparsity than full-attention models, despite aiming to approximate full attention, which may constrain their effectiveness. We attribute this paradox to gradient update deficiency: low-ranked key-value pairs excluded during sparse training receive neither forward contribution nor backward gradients, and thus never learn proper suppression. To overcome this limitation, we propose SSA (Sparse Sparse Attention), a unified training framework that considers both sparse and full attention and enforces bidirectional alignment at every layer. This design preserves gradient flow to all tokens while explicitly encouraging sparse-attention outputs to align with their full-attention counterparts, thereby promoting stronger sparsity. As a result, SSA achieves state-of-the-art performance under both sparse and full attention inference across multiple commonsense benchmarks. Furthermore, SSA enables models to adapt smoothly to varying sparsity budgets; performance improves consistently as more tokens are allowed to attend, supporting flexible compute-performance trade-offs at inference time. Finally, we show that native sparse-attention training surprisingly improves long-context extrapolation by mitigating the over-allocation of attention values in sink areas, with SSA demonstrating the strongest extrapolation capability.

*Somsubhra De,Harsh Kumar,Arun Prakash A*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper explores prompting-based approaches using large language models (LLMs) for grammatical error correction in low-resource Indic languages, achieving state-of-the-art results through few-shot learning strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grammatical error correction (GEC) has made significant progress for high-resource languages like English, but most Indic languages face challenges due to limited resources, linguistic diversity, and complex morphology, creating a need for effective solutions for low-resource settings.

Method: The authors use prompting-based approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5, LLaMA-4) combined with few-shot strategies, employing basic prompting techniques like zero-shot and few-shot approaches with carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation.

Result: The approach achieved leading results in a shared task: 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97), substantially outperforming fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B.

Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC and highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques in bridging resource gaps for multilingual grammatical error correction.

Abstract: Grammatical error correction (GEC) is an important task in Natural Language Processing that aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical mistakes in text. While recent advances in transformer-based models and large annotated datasets have greatly improved GEC performance for high-resource languages such as English, the progress has not extended equally. For most Indic languages, GEC remains a challenging task due to limited resources, linguistic diversity and complex morphology. In this work, we explore prompting-based approaches using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4.1, Gemini-2.5 and LLaMA-4, combined with few-shot strategy to adapt them to low-resource settings. We observe that even basic prompting strategies, such as zero-shot and few-shot approaches, enable these LLMs to substantially outperform fine-tuned Indic-language models like Sarvam-22B, thereby illustrating the exceptional multilingual generalization capabilities of contemporary LLMs for GEC. Our experiments show that carefully designed prompts and lightweight adaptation significantly enhance correction quality across multiple Indic languages. We achieved leading results in the shared task--ranking 1st in Tamil (GLEU: 91.57) and Hindi (GLEU: 85.69), 2nd in Telugu (GLEU: 85.22), 4th in Bangla (GLEU: 92.86), and 5th in Malayalam (GLEU: 92.97). These findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt-driven NLP techniques and underscore the potential of large-scale LLMs to bridge resource gaps in multilingual GEC.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Grid-tagging models enhanced with image data augmentation techniques improve discontinuous entity recognition by addressing segmentation issues, achieving 1-2.5% overall F1 improvement and 3.7-8.4% gain for discontinuous entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional NER methods struggle with discontinuous entities due to text segmentation problems, particularly missing cross-sentence entities, which significantly impacts recognition accuracy.

Method: Integrate image data augmentation techniques (cropping, scaling, padding) into grid-tagging models to enhance discontinuous entity recognition and handle segmentation challenges.

Result: Traditional segmentation methods fail on cross-sentence discontinuous entities, while augmented grid models achieve F1 score improvements of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% specifically for discontinuous entities on CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets.

Conclusion: Image data augmentation combined with grid-tagging models effectively addresses segmentation issues in discontinuous entity recognition, demonstrating significant performance improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing, yet it remains particularly challenging for discontinuous entities. The primary difficulty lies in text segmentation, as traditional methods often missegment or entirely miss cross-sentence discontinuous entities, significantly affecting recognition accuracy. Therefore, we aim to address the segmentation and omission issues associated with such entities. Recent studies have shown that grid-tagging methods are effective for information extraction due to their flexible tagging schemes and robust architectures. Building on this, we integrate image data augmentation techniques, such as cropping, scaling, and padding, into grid-based models to enhance their ability to recognize discontinuous entities and handle segmentation challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that traditional segmentation methods often fail to capture cross-sentence discontinuous entities, leading to decreased performance. In contrast, our augmented grid models achieve notable improvements. Evaluations on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets show F1 score gains of 1-2.5% overall and 3.7-8.4% for discontinuous entities, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.

*Chuyi Kong,Gao Wei,Jing Ma,Hongzhan Lin,Zhiyuan Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REFLEX is a plug-and-play paradigm for automated fact-checking that uses internal model knowledge instead of external sources, improving both verdict accuracy and explanation quality through role-play dialogue and contrastive activation pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based fact-checking systems rely heavily on external knowledge sources, causing latency and hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and real-time responsiveness.

Method: REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as role-play dialogue, jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation, and extracts contrastive activation pairs between backbone model and fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance.

Result: Experiments show REFLEX outperforms previous methods, achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 465 self-refined training samples, and yields up to 7.57% improvement by guiding models without explanatory objectives.

Conclusion: Internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning, enabling more faithful and efficient fact-checking without external knowledge dependencies.

Abstract: The prevalence of misinformation on social media threatens public trust, demanding automated fact-checking systems that provide accurate verdicts with interpretable explanations. However, existing large language model-based (LLM-based) approaches often rely heavily on external knowledge sources, introducing substantial latency and even hallucinations that undermine reliability, interpretability, and responsiveness, which is crucial for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose REason-guided Fact-checking with Latent EXplanations REFLEX paradigm, a plug-and-play, self-refining paradigm that leverages the internal knowledge in backbone model to improve both verdict accuracy and explanation quality. REFLEX reformulates fact-checking as a role-play dialogue and jointly trains verdict prediction and explanation generation. It adaptively extracts contrastive activation pairs between the backbone model and its fine-tuned variant to construct steering vectors that disentangle truth into style and substance naturally. These activation-level signals guide inference and suppress noisy explanations, enabling more faithful and efficient reasoning. Experiments on real-world datasets show that REFLEX outperforms previous methods that steer toward a single truth direction and underscores the challenge traditional approaches face when handling the subtle, human-unknown truth in fact-checking tasks. Remarkably, with only 465 self-refined training samples, RELFEX achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, models trained with explanatory objectives can effectively guide those without them, yielding up to a 7.57% improvement, highlighting that internal explanation signals play a dual role in both interpreting and enhancing factual reasoning.

TL;DR: SpecFormer is a novel architecture that combines unidirectional and bidirectional attention for speculative decoding, enabling efficient LLM inference without large draft trees and achieving consistent acceleration even in large-batch scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current speculative decoding methods require significant computing power and complex draft trees, which conflict with batching techniques that compress idle computing power. There's a need for speculative decoding with low verification resources and scheduling costs.

Method: Proposed SpecFormer architecture integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms, combining autoregressive model's ability to extract information from entire input sequences with parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models.

Result: SpecFormer achieves consistent acceleration across models of various scales through lossless speculative decoding experiments, setting new standards for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.

Conclusion: SpecFormer eliminates reliance on large prefix trees and provides an effective solution for speculative decoding in resource-constrained environments, making it suitable for large-batch inference scenarios.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by utilizing otherwise idle computational resources during memory-to-chip data transfer. Current speculative decoding methods typically assume a considerable amount of available computing power, then generate a complex and massive draft tree using a small autoregressive language model to improve overall prediction accuracy. However, methods like batching have been widely applied in mainstream model inference systems as a superior alternative to speculative decoding, as they compress the available idle computing power. Therefore, performing speculative decoding with low verification resources and low scheduling costs has become an important research problem. We believe that more capable models that allow for parallel generation on draft sequences are what we truly need. Recognizing the fundamental nature of draft models to only generate sequences of limited length, we propose SpecFormer, a novel architecture that integrates unidirectional and bidirectional attention mechanisms. SpecFormer combines the autoregressive model's ability to extract information from the entire input sequence with the parallel generation benefits of non-autoregressive models. This design eliminates the reliance on large prefix trees and achieves consistent acceleration, even in large-batch scenarios. Through lossless speculative decoding experiments across models of various scales, we demonstrate that SpecFormer sets a new standard for scaling LLM inference with lower training demands and reduced computational costs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs can encode relational concepts in analogical reasoning but struggle to apply them to novel situations, showing both emerging capabilities and limitations compared to human cognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether LLMs can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them through structured comparisons in analogical reasoning, which is fundamental to human cognition.

Method: Used proportional and story analogies to analyze LLMs' reasoning patterns, examining how relational information propagates through model layers and testing strategic patching of hidden representations.

Result: LLMs effectively encode relationships between analogous entities but struggle with applying relational information to new entities; strategic patching can partially facilitate information transfer.

Conclusion: LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, showing both parallels and gaps with human analogical reasoning.

Abstract: Analogical reasoning is at the core of human cognition, serving as an important foundation for a variety of intellectual activities. While prior work has shown that LLMs can represent task patterns and surface-level concepts, it remains unclear whether these models can encode high-level relational concepts and apply them to novel situations through structured comparisons. In this work, we explore this fundamental aspect using proportional and story analogies, and identify three key findings. First, LLMs effectively encode the underlying relationships between analogous entities; both attributive and relational information propagate through mid-upper layers in correct cases, whereas reasoning failures reflect missing relational information within these layers. Second, unlike humans, LLMs often struggle not only when relational information is missing, but also when attempting to apply it to new entities. In such cases, strategically patching hidden representations at critical token positions can facilitate information transfer to a certain extent. Lastly, successful analogical reasoning in LLMs is marked by strong structural alignment between analogous situations, whereas failures often reflect degraded or misplaced alignment. Overall, our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit emerging but limited capabilities in encoding and applying high-level relational concepts, highlighting both parallels and gaps with human cognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating LLMs on figurative and culturally grounded reasoning in low-resource languages like Bengali, which is widely spoken but under-resourced.

Method: Created a dataset of 435 Bengali riddles from oral/literary traditions, annotated across 5 dimensions, and converted to multiple-choice format using AI-assisted pipeline. Evaluated 8 frontier LLMs with zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting.

Result: LLMs showed consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning, highlighting limitations in low-resource cultural contexts.

Conclusion: BengaliFig provides a diagnostic tool for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural settings and advances inclusive, heritage-aware NLP evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models excel on broad multilingual benchmarks but remain to be evaluated extensively in figurative and culturally grounded reasoning, especially in low-resource contexts. We present BengaliFig, a compact yet richly annotated challenge set that targets this gap in Bengali, a widely spoken low-resourced language. The dataset contains 435 unique riddles drawn from Bengali oral and literary traditions. Each item is annotated along five orthogonal dimensions capturing reasoning type, trap type, cultural depth, answer category, and difficulty, and is automatically converted to multiple-choice format through a constraint-aware, AI-assisted pipeline. We evaluate eight frontier LLMs from major providers under zero-shot and few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, revealing consistent weaknesses in metaphorical and culturally specific reasoning. BengaliFig thus contributes both a diagnostic probe for evaluating LLM robustness in low-resource cultural contexts and a step toward inclusive and heritage-aware NLP evaluation.

*Md Abdullah Al Kafi,Raka Moni,Sumit Kumar Banshal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel task-oriented evaluation framework for stemming methods using three metrics: Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), Model Performance Delta (MPD), and Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD) to comprehensively assess stemming utility, downstream task impact, and semantic preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation approaches for stemming methods are limited and fail to capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming, making it essential to develop new comprehensive evaluation approaches.

Method: Developed a task-oriented evaluation framework with three metrics: SES for stemming utility, MPD for downstream task impact, and ANLD for semantic similarity between stemmed and original words.

Result: Applied framework to Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball) stemmers. Bangla stemmer achieved highest SES (1.67) but showed harmful over-stemming (ANLD=0.26) and decreased downstream performance. English stemmer achieved moderate SES (1.31) with safe meaning distance (ANLD=0.14) and positive downstream performance.

Conclusion: The framework effectively distinguishes between efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD), revealing that SES alone is insufficient and ANLD is crucial for identifying harmful over-stemming.

Abstract: Text normalization is an essential preprocessing step in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and stemming is one such normalization technique that reduces words to their base or root form. However, evaluating stemming methods is challenging because current evaluation approaches are limited and do not capture the potential harm caused by excessive stemming; therefore, it is essential to develop new approaches to evaluate stemming methods. To address this issue, this study propose a novel, task-oriented approach to evaluate stemming methods, which considers three aspects: (1) the utility of stemming using Stemming Effectiveness Score (SES), (2) the impact of stemming on downstream tasks using Model Performance Delta (MPD), and (3) the semantic similarity between stemmed and original words using Average Normalized Levenshtein Distance (ANLD), thus providing a comprehensive evaluation framework. We apply our evaluation framework to compare two stemmers for Bangla (BNLTK) and English (Snowball), and our results reveal a significant issue, prompting us to analyze their performance in detail. While the Bangla stemmer achieves the highest SES (1.67) due to effective word reduction (CR = 1.90), SES alone is insufficient because our proposed safety measure, ANLD, reveals that this high SES is due to harmful over-stemming (ANLD = 0.26), which correlates with the observed decrease in downstream performance.In contrast, the English stemmer achieves a moderate SES (1.31) with a safe meaning distance (ANLD = 0.14), allowing its word reduction to contribute positively to downstream performance; therefore, it is a more reliable stemmer. Our study provides a valuable tool for distinguishing between potential efficiency gains (high SES) and meaning preservation (low ANLD).

TL;DR: A framework for generating and evaluating 19th-century author style imitation using fine-tuned LLMs and transformer-based detectors, with explainable AI methods for stylistic analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two key challenges in stylometry: training generative models without paired data and evaluating stylistic text beyond human judgment alone.

Method: Fine-tune large language models with single-token prompts to generate text in authors' voices; use transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences for evaluation; apply syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods (attention-based and gradient-based analyses).

Result: Generated text successfully reflects authors' distinctive patterns; AI-based evaluation proves reliable alternative to human assessment.

Conclusion: The framework effectively generates and evaluates author style imitation, with AI-based evaluation offering a viable alternative to human judgment in stylometric analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have created new opportunities for stylometry, the study of writing styles and authorship. Two challenges, however, remain central: training generative models when no paired data exist, and evaluating stylistic text without relying only on human judgment. In this work, we present a framework for both generating and evaluating sentences in the style of 19th-century novelists. Large language models are fine-tuned with minimal, single-token prompts to produce text in the voices of authors such as Dickens, Austen, Twain, Alcott, and Melville. To assess these generative models, we employ a transformer-based detector trained on authentic sentences, using it both as a classifier and as a tool for stylistic explanation. We complement this with syntactic comparisons and explainable AI methods, including attention-based and gradient-based analyses, to identify the linguistic cues that drive stylistic imitation. Our findings show that the generated text reflects the authors' distinctive patterns and that AI-based evaluation offers a reliable alternative to human assessment. All artifacts of this work are published online.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The Adversarial Confusion Attack disrupts multimodal LLMs by inducing systematic incoherence using adversarial images that maximize next-token entropy, with strong transferability across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a new class of threats against MLLMs that cause systematic disruption rather than jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, preventing reliable operation of MLLM-powered agents.

Method: Uses adversarial images optimized to maximize next-token entropy via PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) with a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs.

Result: A single adversarial image disrupts all ensemble models in both full-image and adversarial CAPTCHA settings, with perturbations transferring to unseen open-source and proprietary models like Qwen3-VL and GPT-5.1.

Conclusion: The attack demonstrates that even basic adversarial techniques can create highly transferable perturbations that systematically disrupt MLLMs across different settings and model architectures.

Abstract: We introduce the Adversarial Confusion Attack, a new class of threats against multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Applications include embedding adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.

Motivation: Traditional clinical assessments are unsuitable for LLMs as they assume human-like cognitive processes, creating a need for specialized tools to study linguistic disorders in artificial language systems.

Method: Adapted the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) into a text-only benchmark with four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition, and validated an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Result: The automated evaluation achieved reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model-consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human-human agreement).

Conclusion: TAB provides a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems, enabling systematic study of linguistic disorders in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a candidate "model organism" for human language, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study the computational basis of linguistic disorders like aphasia. However, traditional clinical assessments are ill-suited for LLMs, as they presuppose human-like pragmatic pressures and probe cognitive processes not inherent to artificial architectures. We introduce the Text Aphasia Battery (TAB), a text-only benchmark adapted from the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to assess aphasic-like deficits in LLMs. The TAB comprises four subtests: Connected Text, Word Comprehension, Sentence Comprehension, and Repetition. This paper details the TAB's design, subtests, and scoring criteria. To facilitate large-scale use, we validate an automated evaluation protocol using Gemini 2.5 Flash, which achieves reliability comparable to expert human raters (prevalence-weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.255 for model--consensus agreement vs. 0.286 for human--human agreement). We release TAB as a clinically-grounded, scalable framework for analyzing language deficits in artificial systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel data augmentation technique for speech corpora that improves ASR performance on low-resource languages, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the performance gap in audio ML models between well-resourced languages (like English) and low-resource languages due to data scarcity and costly collection.

Method: Introduces a new data augmentation technique specifically designed for speech corpora to enhance training data for low-resource languages.

Result: Significantly improves automatic speech recognition system performance on low-resource languages and outperforms existing augmentation strategies.

Conclusion: Provides a practical solution for enhancing speech technology in underrepresented linguistic communities by mitigating data scarcity issues.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models for audio tasks often exhibit superior performance on English and other well-resourced languages, primarily due to the abundance of available training data. This disparity leads to an unfair performance gap for low-resource languages, where data collection is both challenging and costly. In this work, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique for speech corpora designed to mitigate this gap. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of automatic speech recognition systems on low-resource languages. Furthermore, we show that our approach outperforms existing augmentation strategies, offering a practical solution for enhancing speech technology in underrepresented linguistic communities.

*Farjana Sultana Mim,Shuchin Aeron,Eric Miller,Kristen Wendell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper introduces an annotated educational dialogue dataset for detecting knowledge construction vs task production discourse in student conversations, with baseline models using GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1 showing suboptimal performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual analysis of student conversations to identify discourse features is time-consuming and limits study scale. NLP can automate this process, but existing NLP research rarely addresses educational dialogue data.

Method: Created annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations, then established baseline models using pre-trained LLMs (GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1) to predict discourse properties for each conversation turn.

Result: Experimental results show that state-of-the-art models perform suboptimally on this task, indicating room for improvement.

Conclusion: There is significant potential for future research in automatically detecting discourse features in educational dialogues, as current advanced models underperform on this specific educational domain task.

Abstract: Identifying discourse features in student conversations is quite important for educational researchers to recognize the curricular and pedagogical variables that cause students to engage in constructing knowledge rather than merely completing tasks. The manual analysis of student conversations to identify these discourse features is time-consuming and labor-intensive, which limits the scale and scope of studies. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate the automatic detection of these discourse features, offering educational researchers scalable and data-driven insights. However, existing studies in NLP that focus on discourse in dialogue rarely address educational data. In this work, we address this gap by introducing an annotated educational dialogue dataset of student conversations featuring knowledge construction and task production discourse. We also establish baseline models for automatically predicting these discourse properties for each turn of talk within conversations, using pre-trained large language models GPT-3.5 and Llama-3.1. Experimental results indicate that these state-of-the-art models perform suboptimally on this task, indicating the potential for future research.

### [33] [On Evaluating LLM Alignment by Evaluating LLMs as Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20604)
*Yixin Liu,Pengfei Liu,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces AlignEval, a benchmark that evaluates LLM alignment by assessing their evaluation capabilities rather than directly judging their generated outputs, leveraging the strong correlation between generation and evaluation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment evaluation requires direct assessment of open-ended responses using human annotators or strong LLM judges, which is resource-intensive. The authors aim to find a more efficient way to measure alignment by exploring the relationship between generation and evaluation capabilities.

Method: First analyzed generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing strong correlation. Then proposed AlignEval benchmark that measures LLM alignment by evaluating them as judges rather than assessing their generated outputs directly.

Result: AlignEval matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks (AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard) in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of evaluating alignment through evaluation capabilities.

Conclusion: There is a strong connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, enabling effective alignment assessment through evaluation performance rather than direct output evaluation, offering a more efficient benchmarking approach.

Abstract: Alignment with human preferences is an important evaluation aspect of LLMs, requiring them to be helpful, honest, safe, and to precisely follow human instructions. Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) alignment typically involves directly assessing their open-ended responses, requiring human annotators or strong LLM judges. Conversely, LLMs themselves have also been extensively evaluated as judges for assessing alignment. In this work, we examine the relationship between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities in aligning with human preferences. To this end, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the generation-evaluation consistency (GE-consistency) among various LLMs, revealing a strong correlation between their generation and evaluation capabilities when evaluated by a strong LLM preference oracle. Utilizing this finding, we propose a benchmarking paradigm that measures LLM alignment with human preferences without directly evaluating their generated outputs, instead assessing LLMs in their role as evaluators. Our evaluation shows that our proposed benchmark, AlignEval, matches or surpasses widely used automatic LLM evaluation benchmarks, such as AlpacaEval and Arena-Hard, in capturing human preferences when ranking LLMs. Our study offers valuable insights into the connection between LLMs' generation and evaluation capabilities, and introduces a benchmark that assesses alignment without directly evaluating model outputs.

TL;DR: LatentMAS enables LLM agents to collaborate directly in latent space rather than text, achieving higher accuracy with significantly reduced token usage and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM agents rely on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, which is inefficient. The goal is to enable more efficient direct collaboration in continuous latent space.

Method: End-to-end training-free framework with auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings and shared latent working memory for lossless information exchange.

Result: Outperforms single-model and text-based MAS baselines by up to 14.6% accuracy, reduces output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and provides 4x-4.3x faster inference across 9 benchmarks.

Conclusion: Latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without additional training.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I evaluation methods using general reward functions or similarity metrics fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes, creating a need for personalized evaluation that aligns with individual user preferences.

Method: PIGReward uses a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions, and assesses images through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning without requiring user-specific training.

Result: PIGReward surpasses existing methods in both accuracy and interpretability, establishing a scalable and reasoning-based foundation for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization. It also enables personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization.

Conclusion: PIGReward represents a robust step toward individually aligned T2I generation, providing a scalable solution for personalized evaluation and optimization that captures diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models generate semantically coherent images from textual prompts, yet evaluating how well they align with individual user preferences remains an open challenge. Conventional evaluation methods, general reward functions or similarity-based metrics, fail to capture the diversity and complexity of personal visual tastes. In this work, we present PIGReward, a personalized reward model that dynamically generates user-conditioned evaluation dimensions and assesses images through CoT reasoning. To address the scarcity of user data, PIGReward adopt a self-bootstrapping strategy that reasons over limited reference data to construct rich user contexts, enabling personalization without user-specific training. Beyond evaluation, PIGReward provides personalized feedback that drives user-specific prompt optimization, improving alignment between generated images and individual intent. We further introduce PIGBench, a per-user preference benchmark capturing diverse visual interpretations of shared prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIGReward surpasses existing methods in both accuracy and interpretability, establishing a scalable and reasoning-based foundation for personalized T2I evaluation and optimization. Taken together, our findings highlight PIGReward as a robust steptoward individually aligned T2I generation.

### [37] [SG-OIF: A Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework for Reliable Vision Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19466)
*Penghao Rao,Runmin Jiang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SG-OIF is a stability-guided online influence framework that provides real-time estimation of training-point influence on test predictions in deep-learning vision models, addressing challenges of computational cost and training non-stationarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing influence function implementations are challenging for deep-learning vision models due to expensive inverse-curvature computations and training non-stationarity invalidating static approximations. Offline computation lags behind training dynamics and produces fragile rankings.

Method: SG-OIF treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, maintaining lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann methods, with modular curvature backends that modulate influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence.

Result: SG-OIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets, with 91.1% accuracy in top 1% prediction samples on CIFAR-10 (20% asymmetric noise) and 99.8% AUPR score on MNIST.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates practical effectiveness as an online influence estimation controller, successfully addressing computational challenges while maintaining real-time performance and robust influence rankings.

Abstract: Approximating training-point influence on test predictions is critical for deploying deep-learning vision models, essential for locating noisy data. Though the influence function was proposed for attributing how infinitesimal up-weighting or removal of individual training examples affects model outputs, its implementation is still challenging in deep-learning vision models: inverse-curvature computations are expensive, and training non-stationarity invalidates static approximations. Prior works use iterative solvers and low-rank surrogates to reduce cost, but offline computation lags behind training dynamics, and missing confidence calibration yields fragile rankings that misidentify critical examples. To address these challenges, we introduce a Stability-Guided Online Influence Framework (SG-OIF), the first framework that treats algorithmic stability as a real-time controller, which (i) maintains lightweight anchor IHVPs via stochastic Richardson and preconditioned Neumann; (ii) proposes modular curvature backends to modulate per-example influence scores using stability-guided residual thresholds, anomaly gating, and confidence. Experimental results show that SG-OIF achieves SOTA (State-Of-The-Art) on noise-label and out-of-distribution detection tasks across multiple datasets with various corruption. Notably, our approach achieves 91.1\% accuracy in the top 1\% prediction samples on the CIFAR-10 (20\% asym), and gets 99.8\% AUPR score on MNIST, effectively demonstrating that this framework is a practical controller for online influence estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD benchmarks lack scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed for real-world assessment, while VAU requires deeper semantic reasoning but is difficult to benchmark due to heavy annotation requirements.

Method: Uses a generation-based pipeline with scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and temporally consistent long-form synthesis to produce coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention.

Result: Pistachio demonstrates scale, diversity, and complexity that reveal new challenges for existing methods and enables more reliable assessment of real-world performance.

Conclusion: The benchmark effectively eliminates biases of Internet-collected datasets and motivates future research on dynamic and multi-event anomaly understanding through its controlled generation approach.

Abstract: Automatically detecting abnormal events in videos is crucial for modern autonomous systems, yet existing Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) benchmarks lack the scene diversity, balanced anomaly coverage, and temporal complexity needed to reliably assess real-world performance. Meanwhile, the community is increasingly moving toward Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU), which requires deeper semantic and causal reasoning but remains difficult to benchmark due to the heavy manual annotation effort it demands. In this paper, we introduce Pistachio, a new VAD/VAU benchmark constructed entirely through a controlled, generation-based pipeline. By leveraging recent advances in video generation models, Pistachio provides precise control over scenes, anomaly types, and temporal narratives, effectively eliminating the biases and limitations of Internet-collected datasets. Our pipeline integrates scene-conditioned anomaly assignment, multi-step storyline generation, and a temporally consistent long-form synthesis strategy that produces coherent 41-second videos with minimal human intervention.

TL;DR: SATA is a universal tracking and segmentation framework that unifies multiple subtasks across different modalities using a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert mechanism and Task-aware Multi-object Tracking pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches use specialized architectures for different tracking and segmentation tasks, limiting generalization and scalability due to distributional gaps across modalities and feature representation gaps across tasks.

Method: Proposes Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) to separate cross-modal shared knowledge from specific information, and Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify task outputs with calibrated ID information.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: SATA offers a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding by effectively addressing cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing challenges.

Abstract: Tracking and segmentation play essential roles in video understanding, providing basic positional information and temporal association of objects within video sequences. Despite their shared objective, existing approaches often tackle these tasks using specialized architectures or modality-specific parameters, limiting their generalization and scalability. Recent efforts have attempted to unify multiple tracking and segmentation subtasks from the perspectives of any modality input or multi-task inference. However, these approaches tend to overlook two critical challenges: the distributional gap across different modalities and the feature representation gap across tasks. These issues hinder effective cross-task and cross-modal knowledge sharing, ultimately constraining the development of a true generalist model. To address these limitations, we propose a universal tracking and segmentation framework named SATA, which unifies a broad spectrum of tracking and segmentation subtasks with any modality input. Specifically, a Decoupled Mixture-of-Expert (DeMoE) mechanism is presented to decouple the unified representation learning task into the modeling process of cross-modal shared knowledge and specific information, thus enabling the model to maintain flexibility while enhancing generalization. Additionally, we introduce a Task-aware Multi-object Tracking (TaMOT) pipeline to unify all the task outputs as a unified set of instances with calibrated ID information, thereby alleviating the degradation of task-specific knowledge during multi-task training. SATA demonstrates superior performance on 18 challenging tracking and segmentation benchmarks, offering a novel perspective for more generalizable video understanding.

### [40] [The Determinant Ratio Matrix Approach to Solving 3D Matching and 2D Orthographic Projection Alignment Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19511)
*Andrew J. Hanson,Sonya M. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents a new determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach for solving 3D-3D (EnP) and 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) pose estimation problems, placing existing methods in a unified framework and showing these solutions could have been discovered much earlier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unified mathematical framework for pose estimation problems, particularly addressing the lack of closed-form solutions for noisy 3D-2D orthographic alignment (OnP) compared to existing exact solutions for 3D-3D alignment (EnP).

Method: Developed the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach to solve least squares systems for error-free EnP and OnP problems, with noisy cases addressed through rotation correction. Placed existing QR decomposition and Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse methods within this DRaM framework.

Result: Presented new solutions for 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation that generalize to N-dimensional Euclidean problems. Showed that DRaM solutions could have been discovered in Gauss's time, providing valuable insights into the mathematical structure of these problems.

Conclusion: The DRaM framework offers both new solutions and deeper understanding of pose estimation problems, unifying existing methods and revealing their mathematical foundations that have been overlooked in previous literature.

Abstract: Pose estimation is a general problem in computer vision with wide applications. The relative orientation of a 3D reference object can be determined from a 3D rotated version of that object, or from a projection of the rotated object to a 2D planar image. This projection can be a perspective projection (the PnP problem) or an orthographic projection (the OnP problem). We restrict our attention here to the OnP problem and the full 3D pose estimation task (the EnP problem). Here we solve the least squares systems for both the error-free EnP and OnP problems in terms of the determinant ratio matrix (DRaM) approach. The noisy-data case can be addressed with a straightforward rotation correction scheme. While the SVD and optimal quaternion eigensystem methods solve the noisy EnP 3D-3D alignment exactly, the noisy 3D-2D orthographic (OnP) task has no known comparable closed form, and can be solved by DRaM-class methods. We note that while previous similar work has been presented in the literature exploiting both the QR decomposition and the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse transformations, here we place these methods in a larger context that has not previously been fully recognized in the absence of the corresponding DRaM solution. We term this class of solutions as the DRaM family, and conduct comparisons of the behavior of the families of solutions for the EnP and OnP rotation estimation problems. Overall, this work presents both a new solution to the 3D and 2D orthographic pose estimation problems and provides valuable insight into these classes of problems. With hindsight, we are able to show that our DRaM solutions to the exact EnP and OnP problems possess derivations that could have been discovered in the time of Gauss, and in fact generalize to all analogous N-dimensional Euclidean pose estimation problems.

Motivation: Current automatic 3D generation methods struggle to achieve fast, detailed, and high-fidelity generation simultaneously, creating a need for more efficient approaches.

Method: Uses a pre-trained variational autoencoder to map 3D geometries to latent features, then sequentially generates coarse geometries, refined geometries, and realistic textures from these latent features.

Result: Generates 3D objects with high fidelity to input images within 70 seconds, showing competitive performance with minimal training compared to contemporary approaches.

Conclusion: LatentDreamer provides an efficient solution for fast, high-quality 3D generation from single images by leveraging latent space representations of 3D geometries.

Abstract: 3D assets are essential in the digital age. While automatic 3D generation, such as image-to-3d, has made significant strides in recent years, it often struggles to achieve fast, detailed, and high-fidelity generation simultaneously. In this work, we introduce LatentDreamer, a novel framework for generating 3D objects from single images. The key to our approach is a pre-trained variational autoencoder that maps 3D geometries to latent features, which greatly reducing the difficulty of 3D generation. Starting from latent features, the pipeline of LatentDreamer generates coarse geometries, refined geometries, and realistic textures sequentially. The 3D objects generated by LatentDreamer exhibit high fidelity to the input images, and the entire generation process can be completed within a short time (typically in 70 seconds). Extensive experiments show that with only a small amount of training, LatentDreamer demonstrates competitive performance compared to contemporary approachs.

Motivation: To understand the fundamental relationship between model capacity and the minimal number of visual tokens needed to preserve image semantics, inspired by the Minimum Description Length principle.

Method: Proposes Orthogonal Filtering, a lightweight module that adaptively clusters redundant tokens into a compact set of orthogonal bases, reinterpreting image tokens as vectors in visual semantic space.

Result: Extensive experiments across ViT models reveal a consistent token-model scaling law: larger models require significantly fewer tokens to span visual semantic space. Also contributes a visual long-context dataset.

Conclusion: Larger vision models can effectively compress visual information into fewer tokens while preserving semantics, demonstrating an important scaling relationship between model capacity and token efficiency.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental relationship between model capacity and the minimal number of visual tokens required to preserve image semantics. Inspired by the Minimum Description Length principle, we reinterpret image tokens as vectors in a visual semantic space and define the intrinsic semantic complexity of an image as the smallest set of basis vectors needed to span this space. Building on this perspective, we propose Orthogonal Filtering, a lightweight module that adaptively clusters redundant tokens into a compact set of orthogonal bases. Through extensive experiments across a range of ViT models, we reveal a consistent token, model scaling law: larger models require significantly fewer tokens to span visual semantic space. Besides, we also contribute a visual long-context dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual grounding methods require extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their generalization to novel scenarios. The authors aim to develop a framework that can perform visual grounding without fine-tuning.

Method: Uses a structured iterative reasoning mechanism combining pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal LLMs, and LLMs to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses.

Result: Achieves 65.1% zero-shot grounding accuracy on RefCOCO benchmarks without fine-tuning. With MLLM-generated captions replaced by original queries, selection accuracy reaches ~90%, close to supervised performance.

Conclusion: GroundingAgent demonstrates strong zero-shot visual grounding capabilities without fine-tuning, with LLM reasoning playing a critical role. The framework offers high interpretability through transparent reasoning steps.

Abstract: Visual grounding, the task of linking textual queries to specific regions within images, plays a pivotal role in vision-language integration. Existing methods typically rely on extensive task-specific annotations and fine-tuning, limiting their ability to generalize effectively to novel or out-of-distribution scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce GroundingAgent, a novel agentic visual grounding framework that operates without any task-specific fine-tuning. GroundingAgent employs a structured, iterative reasoning mechanism that integrates pretrained open-vocabulary object detectors, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and large language models (LLMs) to progressively refine candidate regions through joint semantic and spatial analyses. Remarkably, GroundingAgent achieves an average zero-shot grounding accuracy of 65.1 % on widely-used benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg), entirely without fine-tuning. Furthermore, by substituting MLLM-generated captions with the original query texts, the accuracy at the selection stage alone reaches approximately 90 %, closely matching supervised performance and underscoring the critical role of LLM reasoning capabilities. GroundingAgent also offers strong interpretability, transparently illustrating each reasoning step and providing clear insights into its decision-making process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models are becoming too large for practical deployment, and existing compression methods lack theoretical guarantees about information preservation.

Method: Proposes InfoPrune framework based on Information Bottleneck principle, using entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and KS distance to measure attention head importance, with training-based head pruning and training-free FFN compression via low-rank approximation.

Result: Achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: InfoPrune provides a theoretically grounded and effective approach for efficient multimodal large model compression.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their ever-growing scale poses severe challenges for deployment and efficiency. Existing compression methods often rely on heuristic importance metrics or empirical pruning rules, lacking theoretical guarantees about information preservation. In this work, we propose InfoPrune, an information-theoretic framework for adaptive structural compression of VLMs. Grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, we formulate pruning as a trade-off between retaining task-relevant semantics and discarding redundant dependencies. To quantify the contribution of each attention head, we introduce an entropy-based effective rank (eRank) and employ the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) distance to measure the divergence between original and compressed structures. This yields a unified criterion that jointly considers structural sparsity and informational efficiency. Building on this foundation, we further design two complementary schemes: (1) a training-based head pruning guided by the proposed information loss objective, and (2) a training-free FFN compression via adaptive low-rank approximation. Extensive experiments on VQAv2, TextVQA, and GQA demonstrate that InfoPrune achieves up to 3.2x FLOP reduction and 1.8x acceleration with negligible performance degradation, establishing a theoretically grounded and practically effective step toward efficient multimodal large models.

TL;DR: Introduces Eyelid Angle (ELA) as a novel 3D metric for driver drowsiness detection that's more robust to camera angle variations than traditional methods like EAR, and uses it to generate synthetic datasets for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable driver drowsiness detection is crucial for road safety and ADAS, but current methods using binary eye state or 2D measures are sensitive to camera angles and lack robust geometric descriptions.

Method: Proposes ELA derived from 3D facial landmarks for stable eyelid motion description, designs blink detection framework extracting temporal characteristics, and generates synthetic datasets using ELA signals to animate avatars in Blender 3D.

Result: ELA shows lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR, achieves accurate blink detection in public datasets, and synthetic augmentation expands training data diversity for drowsiness recognition.

Conclusion: ELA serves as both a reliable biometric measure and powerful tool for generating scalable datasets in driver state monitoring, offering robustness and dataset expansion capabilities.

Abstract: Detecting driver drowsiness reliably is crucial for enhancing road safety and supporting advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). We introduce the Eyelid Angle (ELA), a novel, reproducible metric of eye openness derived from 3D facial landmarks. Unlike conventional binary eye state estimators or 2D measures, such as the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the ELA provides a stable geometric description of eyelid motion that is robust to variations in camera angle. Using the ELA, we design a blink detection framework that extracts temporal characteristics, including the closing, closed, and reopening durations, which are shown to correlate with drowsiness levels. To address the scarcity and risk of collecting natural drowsiness data, we further leverage ELA signals to animate rigged avatars in Blender 3D, enabling the creation of realistic synthetic datasets with controllable noise, camera viewpoints, and blink dynamics. Experimental results in public driver monitoring datasets demonstrate that the ELA offers lower variance under viewpoint changes compared to EAR and achieves accurate blink detection. At the same time, synthetic augmentation expands the diversity of training data for drowsiness recognition. Our findings highlight the ELA as both a reliable biometric measure and a powerful tool for generating scalable datasets in driver state monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoChat-M1 is a multi-agent system for video understanding that uses a Collaborative Policy Planning paradigm with multiple policy agents that dynamically generate, execute, and communicate tool invocation policies, enhanced by Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-agent frameworks for video understanding use static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, limiting the discovery of diverse clues needed for robust perception and reasoning in complex videos.

Method: Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with three processes: Policy Generation (each agent creates unique tool invocation policies), Policy Execution (agents invoke tools to explore video content), and Policy Communication (agents interact to update policies). Enhanced with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks. Notably outperforms Gemini 2.5 pro by 3.6% and GPT-4o by 15.6% on LongVideoBench.

Conclusion: The collaborative multi-agent framework with dynamic policy planning and reinforcement learning significantly improves video understanding capabilities, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: By leveraging tool-augmented Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), multi-agent frameworks are driving progress in video understanding. However, most of them adopt static and non-learnable tool invocation mechanisms, which limit the discovery of diverse clues essential for robust perception and reasoning regarding temporally or spatially complex videos. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-agent system for video understanding, namely VideoChat-M1. Instead of using a single or fixed policy, VideoChat-M1 adopts a distinct Collaborative Policy Planning (CPP) paradigm with multiple policy agents, which comprises three key processes. (1) Policy Generation: Each agent generates its unique tool invocation policy tailored to the user's query; (2) Policy Execution: Each agent sequentially invokes relevant tools to execute its policy and explore the video content; (3) Policy Communication: During the intermediate stages of policy execution, agents interact with one another to update their respective policies. Through this collaborative framework, all agents work in tandem, dynamically refining their preferred policies based on contextual insights from peers to effectively respond to the user's query. Moreover, we equip our CPP paradigm with a concise Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method. Consequently, the team of policy agents can be jointly optimized to enhance VideoChat-M1's performance, guided by both the final answer reward and intermediate collaborative process feedback. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoChat-M1 achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks spanning four tasks. Notably, on LongVideoBench, our method outperforms the SOTA model Gemini 2.5 pro by 3.6% and GPT-4o by 15.6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Perceptual Taxonomy is a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning that evaluates models' ability to understand objects, spatial configurations, and task-relevant properties through multiple-choice questions across synthetic and real domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language benchmarks focus on surface-level recognition and image-text alignment, lacking comprehensive evaluation of the structured scene understanding process that humans use for goal-directed reasoning involving objects, spatial relationships, and physical properties.

Method: Created a benchmark by annotating 3173 objects with 84 fine-grained attributes across four property families, then constructed 28033 template-based questions and 50 expert-crafted questions across four reasoning types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, taxonomy reasoning).

Result: Leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10-20% on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning. In-context reasoning examples from simulated scenes improve performance on real-world and expert-curated questions.

Conclusion: There is a persistent gap in structured visual understanding, with current models relying heavily on pattern matching rather than true reasoning. Perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting effectively improves model performance on complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose Perceptual Taxonomy, a structured process of scene understanding that first recognizes objects and their spatial configurations, then infers task-relevant properties such as material, affordance, function, and physical attributes to support goal-directed reasoning. While this form of reasoning is fundamental to human cognition, current vision-language benchmarks lack comprehensive evaluation of this ability and instead focus on surface-level recognition or image-text alignment.
  To address this gap, we introduce Perceptual Taxonomy, a benchmark for physically grounded visual reasoning. We annotate 3173 objects with four property families covering 84 fine-grained attributes. Using these annotations, we construct a multiple-choice question benchmark with 5802 images across both synthetic and real domains. The benchmark contains 28033 template-based questions spanning four types (object description, spatial reasoning, property matching, and taxonomy reasoning), along with 50 expert-crafted questions designed to evaluate models across the full spectrum of perceptual taxonomy reasoning.
  Experimental results show that leading vision-language models perform well on recognition tasks but degrade by 10 to 20 percent on property-driven questions, especially those requiring multi-step reasoning over structured attributes. These findings highlight a persistent gap in structured visual understanding and the limitations of current models that rely heavily on pattern matching. We also show that providing in-context reasoning examples from simulated scenes improves performance on real-world and expert-curated questions, demonstrating the effectiveness of perceptual-taxonomy-guided prompting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MapRF is a weakly supervised framework that constructs 3D HD maps using only 2D image labels, eliminating the need for costly 3D annotations through a self-training approach with Neural Radiance Fields and Map-to-Ray Matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HD map construction methods require expensive 3D map annotations for training, which limits generalization and scalability across diverse driving environments. There's a need for more cost-effective approaches that can work with readily available 2D image labels.

Method: Proposes MapRF with: 1) NeRF module conditioned on map predictions to generate view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics as pseudo labels, 2) Self-training iterative refinement using these pseudo labels, 3) Map-to-Ray Matching strategy to align map predictions with camera rays from 2D labels and mitigate error accumulation.

Result: Achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of baseline performance while surpassing other approaches using only 2D labels on Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets.

Conclusion: MapRF demonstrates potential for scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving by effectively leveraging weak supervision from 2D image labels instead of expensive 3D annotations.

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems benefit from high-definition (HD) maps that provide critical information about road infrastructure. The online construction of HD maps offers a scalable approach to generate local maps from on-board sensors. However, existing methods typically rely on costly 3D map annotations for training, which limits their generalization and scalability across diverse driving environments. In this work, we propose MapRF, a weakly supervised framework that learns to construct 3D maps using only 2D image labels. To generate high-quality pseudo labels, we introduce a novel Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) module conditioned on map predictions, which reconstructs view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics. These pseudo labels are then iteratively used to refine the map network in a self-training manner, enabling progressive improvement without additional supervision. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation during self-training, we propose a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy that aligns map predictions with camera rays derived from 2D labels. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that MapRF achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of the baseline while surpassing several approaches using only 2D labels. This highlights the potential of MapRF to enable scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vidi2 is a video understanding model that advances spatio-temporal grounding and video question answering, outperforming proprietary systems like Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5 on new benchmarks VUE-STG and VUE-TR-V2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video has become the primary medium for internet communication and creativity, creating strong demand for scalable, high-quality video production. There is a need for comprehensive video understanding capabilities including temporal retrieval, spatio-temporal grounding, and multimodal reasoning.

Method: Vidi2 extends video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding and video question answering. It can identify timestamps and bounding boxes of target objects given text queries, enabling end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding. The model is evaluated on new benchmarks VUE-STG and VUE-TR-V2 with improved video duration, query format, annotation quality, and evaluation metrics.

Result: Vidi2 substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems (Gemini 3 Pro and GPT-5) on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG benchmarks. It achieves competitive results with popular open-source models of similar scale on video QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Vidi2 represents a significant advancement in video understanding with its spatio-temporal grounding capabilities, enabling practical applications in complex editing scenarios and demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art proprietary systems.

Abstract: Video has emerged as the primary medium for communication and creativity on the Internet, driving strong demand for scalable, high-quality video production. Vidi models continue to evolve toward next-generation video creation and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multimodal temporal retrieval (TR). In its second release, Vidi2 advances video understanding with fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding (STG) and extends its capability to video question answering (Video QA), enabling comprehensive multimodal reasoning. Given a text query, Vidi2 can identify not only the corresponding timestamps but also the bounding boxes of target objects within the output time ranges. This end-to-end spatio-temporal grounding capability enables potential applications in complex editing scenarios, such as plot or character understanding, automatic multi-view switching, and intelligent, composition-aware reframing and cropping. To enable comprehensive evaluation of STG in practical settings, we introduce a new benchmark, VUE-STG, which offers four key improvements over existing STG datasets: 1) Video duration: spans from roughly 10s to 30 mins, enabling long-context reasoning; 2) Query format: queries are mostly converted into noun phrases while preserving sentence-level expressiveness; 3) Annotation quality: all ground-truth time ranges and bounding boxes are manually annotated with high accuracy; 4) Evaluation metric: a refined vIoU/tIoU/vIoU-Intersection scheme. In addition, we upgrade the previous VUE-TR benchmark to VUE-TR-V2, achieving a more balanced video-length distribution and more user-style queries. Remarkably, the Vidi2 model substantially outperforms leading proprietary systems, such as Gemini 3 Pro (Preview) and GPT-5, on both VUE-TR-V2 and VUE-STG, while achieving competitive results with popular open-source models with similar scale on video QA benchmarks.

TL;DR: A multimodal LLM approach for cross-domain photovoltaic detection that outperforms traditional CV models in generalization across regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed PV systems are rapidly expanding but often undocumented, creating grid management challenges. Traditional computer vision models require extensive labeled data and fail to generalize across different geographic regions.

Method: Leveraged structured prompts and fine-tuning of a multimodal large language model to integrate detection, localization, and quantification of PV systems within a unified schema.

Result: Cross-regional evaluation using ΔF1 metric showed the proposed model achieved the smallest performance degradation across unseen regions, outperforming conventional CV and transformer baselines.

Conclusion: Multimodal LLMs demonstrate robustness under domain shift and have potential for scalable, transferable, and interpretable global PV mapping.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems poses challenges for power grid management, as many installations remain undocumented. While satellite imagery provides global coverage, traditional computer vision (CV) models such as CNNs and U-Nets require extensive labeled data and fail to generalize across regions. This study investigates the cross-domain generalization of a multimodal large language model (LLM) for global PV assessment. By leveraging structured prompts and fine-tuning, the model integrates detection, localization, and quantification within a unified schema. Cross-regional evaluation using the $Δ$F1 metric demonstrates that the proposed model achieves the smallest performance degradation across unseen regions, outperforming conventional CV and transformer baselines. These results highlight the robustness of multimodal LLMs under domain shift and their potential for scalable, transferable, and interpretable global PV mapping.

### [51] [Studying Maps at Scale: A Digital Investigation of Cartography and the Evolution of Figuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19538)
*Remi Petitpierre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This research develops methods and datasets to analyze cartographic heritage at scale, examining maps as cultural objects and semantic-symbolic systems across 771,561 records spanning 1492-1948.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current automated map analysis techniques lack engagement with cartographic history and cultural perspectives, failing to treat maps as semantic-symbolic systems reflecting political and epistemic contexts.

Method: Leverages a corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images from 38 catalogs; uses semantic segmentation and object detection models trained on annotated and synthetic data; analyzes spatial focus, collaboration patterns, and figurative evolution.

Result: Revealed links between Atlantic maritime charting, triangular trade, and colonial expansion; documented progression of national focus and military conflict impacts; identified figurative shifts (e.g., hachures to contours); encoded 63M signs into visual space showing local consistency; highlighted role of legitimacy and major cities in semiotic diffusion.

Conclusion: Maps are designed images with intentional framing and composition; cartographic signs form locally consistent systems; cultural and political factors significantly shape cartographic representation and semiotic evolution over centuries.

Abstract: This thesis presents methods and datasets to investigate cartographic heritage on a large scale and from a cultural perspective. Heritage institutions worldwide have digitized more than one million maps, and automated techniques now enable large-scale recognition and extraction of map content. Yet these methods have engaged little with the history of cartography, or the view that maps are semantic-symbolic systems, and cultural objects reflecting political and epistemic expectations. This work leverages a diverse corpus of 771,561 map records and 99,715 digitized images aggregated from 38 digital catalogs. After normalization, the dataset includes 236,925 contributors and spans six centuries, from 1492 to 1948. These data make it possible to chart geographic structures and the global chronology of map publication. The spatial focus of cartography is analyzed in relation to political dynamics, evidencing links between Atlantic maritime charting, the triangular trade, and colonial expansion. Further results document the progression of national, domestic focus and the impact of military conflicts on publication volumes. The research introduces semantic segmentation techniques and object detection models for the generic recognition of land classes and cartographic signs, trained on annotated data and synthetic images. The analysis of land classes shows that maps are designed images whose framing and composition emphasize features through centering and semantic symmetries. The study of cartographic figuration encodes 63 M signs and 25 M fragments into a latent visual space, revealing figurative shifts such as the replacement of relief hachures by terrain contours and showing that signs tend to form locally consistent systems. Analyses of collaboration and diffusion highlight the role of legitimacy, larger actors, and major cities in the spread of figurative norms and semiotic cultures.

*Jaeyeong Kim,Seungwoo Yoo,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpLap is a proxy-free deformation method for Gaussian splats that uses a novel surface-aware splat graph and Laplacian operator, eliminating the need for deformation proxies like cages or meshes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GS deformation methods rely on deformation proxies which suffer from dependency on proxy quality and computational overhead, while direct Laplacian-based approaches on point clouds fail to capture surface information properly.

Method: Constructs a surface-aware splat graph using splat intersections rather than just center distances, and applies Laplacian-based deformation with Gaussian kernel adaptation to preserve surface structure.

Result: Superior performance compared to both proxy-based and proxy-free baselines on 50 challenging objects from ShapeNet, Objaverse, Sketchfab, and NeRF-Synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed method enables more plausible deformations that preserve details and topology without requiring deformation proxies, with improved rendering quality after deformation.

Abstract: We introduce SpLap, a proxy-free deformation method for Gaussian splats (GS) based on a Laplacian operator computed from our novel surface-aware splat graph. Existing approaches to GS deformation typically rely on deformation proxies such as cages or meshes, but they suffer from dependency on proxy quality and additional computational overhead. An alternative is to directly apply Laplacian-based deformation techniques by treating splats as point clouds. However, this often fail to properly capture surface information due to lack of explicit structure. To address this, we propose a novel method that constructs a surface-aware splat graph, enabling the Laplacian operator derived from it to support more plausible deformations that preserve details and topology. Our key idea is to leverage the spatial arrangement encoded in splats, defining neighboring splats not merely by the distance between their centers, but by their intersections. Furthermore, we introduce a Gaussian kernel adaptation technique that preserves surface structure under deformation, thereby improving rendering quality after deformation. In our experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to both proxy-based and proxy-free baselines, evaluated on 50 challenging objects from the ShapeNet, Objaverse, and Sketchfab datasets, as well as the NeRF-Synthetic dataset.

TL;DR: ThiFAN-VQA is a two-stage reasoning-based VQA framework for disaster damage assessment that uses chain-of-thought prompting and answer selection to improve accuracy and interpretability in UAV imagery analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI approaches for disaster damage assessment face limitations: costly data annotation, limited dataset diversity, fixed answer spaces requiring retraining, and generative models producing hallucinated or generic responses.

Method: Two-stage framework: 1) Generate structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning, 2) Answer selection module evaluates responses to assign most coherent and accurate answer. Integrates custom information retrieval, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided selection.

Result: Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA datasets demonstrate superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency for effective disaster damage assessment using UAV imagery.

Abstract: Timely and accurate assessment of damages following natural disasters is essential for effective emergency response and recovery. Recent AI-based frameworks have been developed to analyze large volumes of aerial imagery collected by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, providing actionable insights rapidly. However, creating and annotating data for training these models is costly and time-consuming, resulting in datasets that are limited in size and diversity. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely on traditional classification-based frameworks with fixed answer spaces, restricting their ability to provide new information without additional data collection or model retraining. Using pre-trained generative models built on in-context learning (ICL) allows for flexible and open-ended answer spaces. However, these models often generate hallucinated outputs or produce generic responses that lack domain-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose ThiFAN-VQA, a two-stage reasoning-based framework for visual question answering (VQA) in disaster scenarios. ThiFAN-VQA first generates structured reasoning traces using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and ICL to enable interpretable reasoning under limited supervision. A subsequent answer selection module evaluates the generated responses and assigns the most coherent and contextually accurate answer, effectively improve the model performance. By integrating a custom information retrieval system, domain-specific prompting, and reasoning-guided answer selection, ThiFAN-VQA bridges the gap between zero-shot and supervised methods, combining flexibility with consistency. Experiments on FloodNet and RescueNet-VQA, UAV-based datasets from flood- and hurricane-affected regions, demonstrate that ThiFAN-VQA achieves superior accuracy, interpretability, and adaptability for real-world post-disaster damage assessment tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents HunyuanOCR, a commercial-grade, open-source, and lightweight (1B parameters) Vision-Language Model (VLM) dedicated to OCR tasks. The architecture comprises a Native Vision Transformer (ViT) and a lightweight LLM connected via an MLP adapter. HunyuanOCR demonstrates superior performance, outperforming commercial APIs, traditional pipelines, and larger models (e.g., Qwen3-VL-4B). Specifically, it surpasses current public solutions in perception tasks (Text Spotting, Parsing) and excels in semantic tasks (IE, Text Image Translation), securing first place in the ICDAR 2025 DIMT Challenge (Small Model Track). Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on OCRBench among VLMs with fewer than 3B parameters.
  HunyuanOCR achieves breakthroughs in three key aspects: 1) Unifying Versatility and Efficiency: We implement comprehensive support for core capabilities including spotting, parsing, IE, VQA, and translation within a lightweight framework. This addresses the limitations of narrow "OCR expert models" and inefficient "General VLMs". 2) Streamlined End-to-End Architecture: Adopting a pure end-to-end paradigm eliminates dependencies on pre-processing modules (e.g., layout analysis). This fundamentally resolves error propagation common in traditional pipelines and simplifies system deployment. 3) Data-Driven and RL Strategies: We confirm the critical role of high-quality data and, for the first time in the industry, demonstrate that Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategies yield significant performance gains in OCR tasks.
  HunyuanOCR is officially open-sourced on HuggingFace. We also provide a high-performance deployment solution based on vLLM, placing its production efficiency in the top tier. We hope this model will advance frontier research and provide a solid foundation for industrial applications.

TL;DR: Semi-supervised GAN-based method for early ischemic stroke segmentation in NCCT scans using limited labeled data and leveraging unlabeled scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early ischemic stroke detection is time-critical but challenging with NCCT due to subtle changes in hyperacute phase, leading to delayed interventions.

Method: Adversarial framework with GANs using Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, feature matching loss and self-training loss to learn from limited annotated scans and larger unlabeled dataset.

Result: Experiments on AISD dataset show method can accurately delineate early infarcts even when faint or small, enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

Conclusion: Proposed approach reduces manual annotation burden and supports more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke is a time-critical medical emergency where rapid diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in GI imaging due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, which hinders development of Clinical Decision Support systems for Wireless Capsule Endoscopy.

Method: Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE) that can introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images and enable conditional generation of different abnormality types.

Result: Generated abnormal images yield comparable classification results to classifiers trained with only real data, demonstrating utility for CDS development.

Conclusion: The proposed methodology effectively addresses medical data scarcity and shows promise for broader applicability in medical multimedia domains.

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.

TL;DR: SkillSight enables power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data by using gaze information instead of continuous video processing, achieving 73x power reduction while maintaining high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic skill assessment from egocentric perception on smart glasses is challenging, and current methods are power-intensive due to continuous video processing.

Method: Two-stage framework: first learns joint gaze-video model for skill prediction, then distills a gaze-only student model that eliminates video processing at inference.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets (cooking, music, sports) and gaze-only student maintains high accuracy with 73x less power than competing methods.

Conclusion: Gaze is valuable for skill understanding across diverse real-world settings, paving the way for in-the-wild AI-supported skill learning on power-constrained devices.

Abstract: Egocentric perception on smart glasses could transform how we learn new skills in the physical world, but automatic skill assessment remains a fundamental technical challenge. We introduce SkillSight for power-efficient skill assessment from first-person data. Central to our approach is the hypothesis that skill level is evident not only in how a person performs an activity (video), but also in how they direct their attention when doing so (gaze). Our two-stage framework first learns to jointly model gaze and egocentric video when predicting skill level, then distills a gaze-only student model. At inference, the student model requires only gaze input, drastically reducing power consumption by eliminating continuous video processing.

*Ruimin Feng,Xingxin He,Ronald Mercer,Zachary Stewart,Fang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-language foundation models can enhance undersampled MRI reconstruction by providing high-level semantic priors through contrastive learning, improving perceptual quality and anatomical structure preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether vision-language foundation models can provide high-level contextual information beyond conventional priors for undersampled MRI reconstruction.

Method: Proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework using pre-trained vision-language models to encode images and auxiliary information into semantic features, with contrastive learning to align reconstructed representations with target semantic distributions.

Result: Experiments on knee and brain datasets showed semantic priors preserve fine anatomical structures, achieve superior perceptual quality (lower LPIPS, higher Tenengrad scores), and enable high-level control over reconstruction attributes while maintaining data fidelity.

Conclusion: Vision-language foundation models can improve undersampled MRI reconstruction through semantic-space optimization, demonstrating effectiveness of semantic priors from multimodal sources.

Abstract: Purpose: To investigate whether a vision-language foundation model can enhance undersampled MRI reconstruction by providing high-level contextual information beyond conventional priors. Methods: We proposed a semantic distribution-guided reconstruction framework that uses a pre-trained vision-language foundation model to encode both the reconstructed image and auxiliary information into high-level semantic features. A contrastive objective aligns the reconstructed representation with the target semantic distribution, ensuring consistency with high-level perceptual cues. The proposed objective works with various deep learning-based reconstruction methods and can flexibly incorporate semantic priors from multimodal sources. To test the effectiveness of these semantic priors, we evaluated reconstruction results guided by priors derived from either image-only or image-language auxiliary information. Results: Experiments on knee and brain datasets demonstrate that semantic priors from images preserve fine anatomical structures and achieve superior perceptual quality, as reflected in lower LPIPS values, higher Tenengrad scores, and improved scores in the reader study, compared with conventional regularization. The image-language information further expands the semantic distribution and enables high-level control over reconstruction attributes. Across all evaluations, the contrastive objective consistently guided the reconstructed features toward the desired semantic distributions while maintaining data fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework. Conclusion: The study highlights that vision-language foundation models can improve undersampled MRI reconstruction through semantic-space optimization.

TL;DR: GIANT framework enables LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide pathology images like pathologists, achieving superior performance on medical image interpretation tasks compared to conventional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose large multimodal models have shown poor performance in medical image interpretation, especially for gigapixel pathology images, due to previous approaches using low-resolution thumbnails or random patches.

Method: Introduced GIANT framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images like pathologists, and created MultiPathQA benchmark with 934 WSI-level questions across five clinically-relevant tasks.

Result: GIANT substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing specialized models. GPT-5 with GIANT achieved 62.5% accuracy on pathologist-authored questions, outperforming TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%).

Conclusion: The study reveals strengths and limitations of current foundation models and provides groundwork for developing LMMs for expert reasoning in pathology.

Abstract: Despite being widely used to support clinical care, general-purpose large multimodal models (LMMs) have generally shown poor or inconclusive performance in medical image interpretation, particularly in pathology, where gigapixel images are used. However, prior studies have used either low-resolution thumbnails or random patches, which likely underestimated model performance. Here, we ask whether LMMs can be adapted to reason coherently and accurately in the evaluation of such images. In this study, we introduce Gigapixel Image Agent for Navigating Tissue (GIANT), the first framework that allows LMMs to iteratively navigate whole-slide images (WSIs) like a pathologist. Accompanying GIANT, we release MultiPathQA, a new benchmark, which comprises 934 WSI-level questions, encompassing five clinically-relevant tasks ranging from cancer diagnosis to open-ended reasoning. MultiPathQA also includes 128 questions, authored by two professional pathologists, requiring direct slide interpretation. Using MultiPathQA, we show that our simple agentic system substantially outperforms conventional patch- and thumbnail-based baselines, approaching or surpassing the performance of specialized models trained on millions of images. For example, on pathologist-authored questions, GPT-5 with GIANT achieves 62.5% accuracy, outperforming specialist pathology models such as TITAN (43.8%) and SlideChat (37.5%). Our findings reveal the strengths and limitations of current foundation models and ground future development of LMMs for expert reasoning in pathology.

### [60] [CodeV: Code with Images for Faithful Visual Reasoning via Tool-Aware Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19661)
*Xinhai Hou,Shaoyuan Xu,Manan Biyani,Mayan Li,Jia Liu,Todd C. Hollon,Bryan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO) to address unfaithful visual reasoning in vision-language models, achieving both high accuracy and improved faithfulness in tool use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models often achieve high final-answer accuracy through unfaithful visual reasoning - using tools on irrelevant regions or ignoring tool outputs while still guessing correctly, which undermines trustworthiness.

Method: Proposes CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with TAPO - a process-level RL framework that provides dense rewards based on visual tool inputs and outputs rather than chain-of-thought tokens, representing tools as executable Python code.

Result: CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on visual search benchmarks, and also performs well on multimodal reasoning and math tasks.

Conclusion: Explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior through process-level rewards is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems that use tools faithfully.

Abstract: Agentic vision-language models are increasingly trained to "think with images" by calling image operations. However, we show that high final-answer accuracy often hides unfaithful visual reasoning: models may invoke tools on irrelevant regions or ignore tool outputs entirely, yet still guess the correct answer. In this work, we first propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol that measures whether intermediate visual tool outputs (e.g., crops) actually contain the queried evidence. This reveals that recent visual agents achieve high final-answer accuracy but exhibit low rates of faithful tool-use on visual search benchmarks. We then introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO). TAPO is a process-level RL framework that augments GRPO with dense rewards defined directly on visual tool inputs and outputs, rather than on chain-of-thought tokens, making supervision easier to verify and less susceptible to reward hacking. CodeV represents visual tools as executable Python code, and TAPO assigns step-wise rewards based solely on the question and tool output, encouraging both necessary and evidence-consistent tool use. In a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline, CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on related visual search benchmarks. Beyond visual search, CodeV attains strong performance on a range of multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems.

Abstract: OncoVision is a multimodal AI pipeline that combines mammography images and clinical data for better breast cancer diagnosis. Employing an attention-based encoder-decoder backbone, it jointly segments four ROIs - masses, calcifications, axillary findings, and breast tissues - with state-of-the-art accuracy and robustly predicts ten structured clinical features: mass morphology, calcification type, ACR breast density, and BI-RADS categories. To fuse imaging and clinical insights, we developed two late-fusion strategies. By utilizing complementary multimodal data, late fusion strategies improve diagnostic precision and reduce inter-observer variability. Operationalized as a secure, user-friendly web application, OncoVision produces structured reports with dual-confidence scoring and attention-weighted visualizations for real-time diagnostic support to improve clinician trust and facilitate medical teaching. It can be easily incorporated into the clinic, making screening available in underprivileged areas around the world, such as rural South Asia. Combining accurate segmentation with clinical intuition, OncoVision raises the bar for AI-based mammography, offering a scalable and equitable solution to detect breast cancer at an earlier stage and enhancing treatment through timely interventions.

Motivation: Existing layer pruning methods lead to significant performance drop when applied to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), creating a need for more effective pruning approaches that preserve model performance.

Method: Analyze triplets of consecutive layers to identify local redundancy, remove the most redundant of the first two layers, finetune the remaining layer to compensate for lost capacity, and freeze the third layer as a stable anchor during finetuning. Uses interleaved finetune-freeze design for rapid convergence.

Result: Achieves 88.9% average performance retention after dropping 25% of the network, achieving state-of-the-art performance by finetuning only a subset of layers on just 1% of the FineVision dataset for one epoch.

Conclusion: INTERLACE enables efficient layer pruning for VLMs with minimal data requirements while maintaining high performance, representing a significant advancement in model compression techniques.

Abstract: We introduce INTERLACE, a novel framework that prunes redundant layers in VLMs while maintaining performance through sample-efficient finetuning. Existing layer pruning methods lead to significant performance drop when applied to VLMs. Instead, we analyze triplets of consecutive layers to identify local redundancy, removing the most redundant of the first two layers, finetune the remaining layer to compensate for the lost capacity, and freeze the third layer to serve as a stable anchor during finetuning. We found that this interleaved finetune-freeze design enables rapid convergence with minimal data after pruning.

Abstract: Cell counting in biomedical imaging is pivotal for various clinical applications, yet the interpretability of deep learning models in this domain remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel prototype-based method for interpretable cell counting via density map estimation. Our approach integrates a prototype layer into the density estimation network, enabling the model to learn representative visual patterns for both cells and background artifacts.

By generating interpretations that highlight regions in the input image most similar to each prototype, our method offers a clear understanding of how the model identifies and counts cells. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves interpretability without compromising counting effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation either rely on limited training data or combine multiple models at high computational cost, creating a need for more efficient and effective solutions.

Method: Enhanced RADIO model with self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and computationally efficient mask refinement for zero-shot OVSS.

Result: 6-30% mIoU improvement in base ViT class, 3.95x faster, 2.5x fewer parameters, and outperforms previous huge vision model combinations (850-1350M) with only 105M parameters.

Conclusion: RADSeg achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in zero-shot open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with substantially lower computational and memory costs compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) underpins many vision and robotics tasks that require generalizable semantic understanding. Existing approaches either rely on limited segmentation training data, which hinders generalization, or apply zero-shot heuristics to vision-language models (e.g CLIP), while the most competitive approaches combine multiple models to improve performance at the cost of high computational and memory demands. In this work, we leverage an overlooked agglomerative vision foundation model, RADIO, to improve zero-shot OVSS along three key axes simultaneously: mIoU, latency, and parameter efficiency. We present the first comprehensive study of RADIO for zero-shot OVSS and enhance its performance through self-correlating recursive attention, self-correlating global aggregation, and computationally efficient mask refinement. Our approach, RADSeg, achieves 6-30% mIoU improvement in the base ViT class while being 3.95x faster and using 2.5x fewer parameters. Surprisingly, RADSeg-base (105M) outperforms previous combinations of huge vision models (850-1350M) in mIoU, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially lower computational and memory cost.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes branch-based structural reparameterization to reduce Vision Transformer layers while maintaining accuracy, achieving up to 37% speedup on mobile CPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision Transformer acceleration focuses on algorithmic optimizations, leaving layer reduction underexplored despite deep architectures being computationally expensive.

Method: Uses parallel branches in transformer blocks during training that can be consolidated into single-path models for inference, merging branches at nonlinear component entry points for exact mathematical reparameterization.

Result: Reduced ViT-Tiny from 12 layers to 6, 4, or 3 layers while maintaining ImageNet-1K accuracy, achieving up to 37% inference speedup on mobile CPUs.

Conclusion: Extremely deep transformer stacks may be unnecessarily restrictive, and branch-based reparameterization offers new opportunities for efficient vision transformers.

Abstract: The computational overhead of Vision Transformers in practice stems fundamentally from their deep architectures, yet existing acceleration strategies have primarily targeted algorithmic-level optimizations such as token pruning and attention speedup. This leaves an underexplored research question: can we reduce the number of stacked transformer layers while maintaining comparable representational capacity? To answer this, we propose a branch-based structural reparameterization technique that operates during the training phase. Our approach leverages parallel branches within transformer blocks that can be systematically consolidated into streamlined single-path models suitable for inference deployment. The consolidation mechanism works by gradually merging branches at the entry points of nonlinear components, enabling both feed-forward networks (FFN) and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules to undergo exact mathematical reparameterization without inducing approximation errors at test time. When applied to ViT-Tiny, the framework successfully reduces the original 12-layer architecture to 6, 4, or as few as 3 layers while maintaining classification accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The resulting compressed models achieve inference speedups of up to 37% on mobile CPU platforms. Our findings suggest that the conventional wisdom favoring extremely deep transformer stacks may be unnecessarily restrictive, and point toward new opportunities for constructing efficient vision transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small objects are difficult to detect from high-altitude UAVs due to low object-to-background pixel ratios in maritime search and rescue missions.

Method: Proposed altitude-aware dynamic tiling that scales and adaptively subdivides images into tiles using altitude-dependent scaling and adaptive tiling factor, integrated with YOLOv5 and SAHI framework.

Result: 38% improvement in Mean Average Precision for small objects compared to baseline, and more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling on SeaDronesSee dataset.

Conclusion: The approach enables more efficient and accurate UAV-based search and rescue operations under diverse conditions by reducing unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are crucial in Search and Rescue (SAR) missions due to their ability to monitor vast maritime areas. However, small objects often remain difficult to detect from high altitudes due to low object-to-background pixel ratios. We propose an altitude-aware dynamic tiling method that scales and adaptively subdivides the image into tiles for enhanced small object detection. By integrating altitude-dependent scaling with an adaptive tiling factor, we reduce unnecessary computation while maintaining detection performance. Tested on the SeaDronesSee dataset [1] with YOLOv5 [2] and Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) framework [3], our approach improves Mean Average Precision (mAP) for small objects by 38% compared to a baseline and achieves more than double the inference speed compared to static tiling. This approach enables more efficient and accurate UAV-based SAR operations under diverse conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational cost limitations of Optimal Transport while enabling transferability of learned slicers across related distribution pairs, particularly in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations.

Method: Introduces min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework with minibatch formulation for scalability, theoretically analyzing slicer transferability under distributional perturbations and providing statistical accuracy guarantees.

Result: Theoretically shows optimized slicers remain close under slight data distribution perturbations; empirically demonstrates strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.

Conclusion: Transferable min-STP framework enables efficient and scalable Optimal Transport with transferable slicers that work effectively across related distribution pairs, bridging computational efficiency with practical applicability.

Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) offers a powerful framework for finding correspondences between distributions and addressing matching and alignment problems in various areas of computer vision, including shape analysis, image generation, and multimodal tasks. The computation cost of OT, however, hinders its scalability. Slice-based transport plans have recently shown promise for reducing the computational cost by leveraging the closed-form solutions of 1D OT problems. These methods optimize a one-dimensional projection (slice) to obtain a conditional transport plan that minimizes the transport cost in the ambient space. While efficient, these methods leave open the question of whether learned optimal slicers can transfer to new distribution pairs under distributional shift. Understanding this transferability is crucial in settings with evolving data or repeated OT computations across closely related distributions. In this paper, we study the min-Sliced Transport Plan (min-STP) framework and investigate the transferability of optimized slicers: can a slicer trained on one distribution pair yield effective transport plans for new, unseen pairs? Theoretically, we show that optimized slicers remain close under slight perturbations of the data distributions, enabling efficient transfer across related tasks. To further improve scalability, we introduce a minibatch formulation of min-STP and provide statistical guarantees on its accuracy. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transferable min-STP achieves strong one-shot matching performance and facilitates amortized training for point cloud alignment and flow-based generative modeling.

Conclusion: Pathology foundation models show promise for real-world clinical applications, with PathFMTools enabling efficient analysis and validation of adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Despite the promise of computational pathology foundation models, adapting them to specific clinical tasks remains challenging due to the complexity of whole-slide image (WSI) processing, the opacity of learned features, and the wide range of potential adaptation strategies. To address these challenges, we introduce PathFMTools, a lightweight, extensible Python package that enables efficient execution, analysis, and visualization of pathology foundation models. We use this tool to interface with and evaluate two state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models, CONCH and MUSK, on the task of histological grading in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a critical criterion that informs cSCC staging and patient management. Using a cohort of 440 cSCC H&E WSIs, we benchmark multiple adaptation strategies, demonstrating trade-offs across prediction approaches and validating the potential of using foundation model embeddings to train small specialist models. These findings underscore the promise of pathology foundation models for real-world clinical applications, with PathFMTools enabling efficient analysis and validation.

TL;DR: This paper extends prototype networks to multimodal settings for species detection, addressing interpretability and cost issues by selectively using expensive genetic data only when needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the black-box nature of neural networks and reduce reliance on expensive, invasive genetic data collection for species detection.

Method: Extended prototype networks (ProtoPNets) to multimodal setting with ensemble prototypes from each modality, using weighted predictions and methods to identify when expensive genetic data isn't needed.

Result: The approach intelligently allocates genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications, achieving comparable accuracy to models using both modalities consistently.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal prototype network framework provides interpretable species detection while reducing the need for expensive genetic data collection through intelligent modality allocation.

Abstract: Species detection is important for monitoring the health of ecosystems and identifying invasive species, serving a crucial role in guiding conservation efforts. Multimodal neural networks have seen increasing use for identifying species to help automate this task, but they have two major drawbacks. First, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of their decision making process. Second, collecting genetic data is often expensive and requires invasive procedures, often necessitating researchers to capture or kill the target specimen. We address both of these problems by extending prototype networks (ProtoPNets), which are a popular and interpretable alternative to traditional neural networks, to the multimodal, cost-aware setting. We ensemble prototypes from each modality, using an associated weight to determine how much a given prediction relies on each modality. We further introduce methods to identify cases for which we do not need the expensive genetic information to make confident predictions. We demonstrate that our approach can intelligently allocate expensive genetic data for fine-grained distinctions while using abundant image data for clearer visual classifications and achieving comparable accuracy to models that consistently use both modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TPSO is a training-free method that enhances diversity in text-to-image diffusion models by optimizing token-prompt embedding space to explore underrepresented regions while maintaining image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-image diffusion models suffer from low diversity, generating repetitive outputs that collapse to strong modes in the learned distribution, hindering creative exploration and downstream applications.

Method: Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO) introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of token embedding space while using prompt-level space as global semantic constraint to prevent quality degradation.

Result: Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points without sacrificing image quality.

Conclusion: TPSO effectively addresses the diversity challenge in text-to-image generation by optimizing token embedding space exploration while maintaining high fidelity, offering a training-free and model-agnostic solution.

Abstract: Image diversity remains a fundamental challenge for text-to-image diffusion models. Low-diversity models tend to generate repetitive outputs, increasing sampling redundancy and hindering both creative exploration and downstream applications. A primary cause is that generation often collapses toward a strong mode in the learned distribution. Existing attempts to improve diversity, such as noise resampling, prompt rewriting, or steering-based guidance, often still collapse to dominant modes or introduce distortions that degrade image quality. In light of this, we propose Token-Prompt embedding Space Optimization (TPSO), a training-free and model-agnostic module. TPSO introduces learnable parameters to explore underrepresented regions of the token embedding space, reducing the tendency of the model to repeatedly generate samples from strong modes of the learned distribution. At the same time, the prompt-level space provides a global semantic constraint that regulates distribution shifts, preventing quality degradation while maintaining high fidelity. Extensive experiments on MS-COCO and three diffusion backbones show that TPSO significantly enhances generative diversity, improving baseline performance from 1.10 to 4.18 points, without sacrificing image quality. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Result: Extensive experiments show VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions across multiple datasets and domains.

Conclusion: VESSA successfully incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks, demonstrating strong performance in semi-supervised medical image segmentation with minimal labeled data.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an effective paradigm for medical image segmentation, reducing the reliance on extensive expert annotations. Meanwhile, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and few-shot capabilities across diverse visual domains. In this work, we integrate VLM-based segmentation into semi-supervised medical image segmentation by introducing a Vision-Language Enhanced Semi-supervised Segmentation Assistant (VESSA) that incorporates foundation-level visual-semantic understanding into SSL frameworks. Our approach consists of two stages. In Stage 1, the VLM-enhanced segmentation foundation model VESSA is trained as a reference-guided segmentation assistant using a template bank containing gold-standard exemplars, simulating learning from limited labeled data. Given an input-template pair, VESSA performs visual feature matching to extract representative semantic and spatial cues from exemplar segmentations, generating structured prompts for a SAM2-inspired mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. In Stage 2, VESSA is integrated into a state-of-the-art SSL framework, enabling dynamic interaction with the student model: as student predictions become more refined, they are fed back to VESSA as prompts, allowing it to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels and stronger guidance. Extensive experiments across multiple segmentation datasets and domains show that VESSA-augmented SSL significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines under extremely limited annotation conditions.

*Miguel Carvalho,Helder Dias,Bruno Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropVLM is an external method that enables VLMs to dynamically zoom in on relevant image regions to improve fine-grained image understanding without modifying the VLM itself.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models struggle with fine-grained image understanding tasks like scene-text recognition and document analysis due to perception limitations and visual fragmentation.

Method: CropVLM uses reinforcement learning to train a model that can dynamically crop and zoom into relevant image regions, without human-labeled bounding boxes or synthetic evaluations.

Result: Significant improvements on tasks requiring high-resolution image understanding, especially for out-of-domain benchmarks, without catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: CropVLM is a low-cost, train-once method that can be paired with various VLMs to enhance their fine-grained perception capabilities without modifying the base models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often struggle with tasks that require fine-grained image understanding, such as scene-text recognition or document analysis, due to perception limitations and visual fragmentation. To address these challenges, we introduce CropVLM as an external low-cost method for boosting performance, enabling VLMs to dynamically ''zoom in'' on relevant image regions, enhancing their ability to capture fine details. CropVLM is trained using reinforcement learning, without using human-labeled bounding boxes as a supervision signal, and without expensive synthetic evaluations. The model is trained once and can be paired with both open-source and proprietary VLMs to improve their performance. Our approach delivers significant improvements on tasks that require high-resolution image understanding, notably for benchmarks that are out-of-domain for the target VLM, without modifying or fine-tuning the VLM, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting.

*Linxin Hua,Jianghua Deng,Ye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a new 'relative angle' feature for point cloud damage detection that achieves similar performance to normal vectors while reducing storage by 27.6% and input channels by 83%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud reconstruction is effective for damage detection but constrained by high 3D data volume. Need for more efficient features to enable deployment on resource-constrained hardware.

Method: Introduces relative angle feature - angle between point's normal vector and average normal vector of parent point cloud. Uses entropy-based feature evaluation and trains models with PointNet++.

Result: Models using relative angles achieved similar performance to normal vector-based models while reducing storage by 27.6% and compressing input channels by 83%.

Conclusion: Relative angle is a novel single-dimensional feature that enables larger-batch execution on resource-limited hardware without requiring model architecture changes.

Abstract: Point cloud reconstruction of damage offers an effective solution to image-based methods vulnerable to background noise, yet its application is constrained by the high volume of 3D data. This study proposes a new feature, relative angle, computed as the angle between the normal vector of a point and the average normal vector of its parent point cloud. This single-dimensional feature provides directionality information equivalent to normal vectors for concrete surface defect characteristics. Through entropy-based feature evaluation, this study demonstrates the ability of relative angle to filter out redundant information in undamaged sections while retaining effective information in damaged sections. By training and testing with PointNet++, models based on the relative angles achieved similar performance to that of models based on normal vectors while delivering 27.6% storage reduction and 83% input channel compression. This novel feature has the potential to enable larger-batch execution on resource-constrained hardware without the necessity of architectural modifications to models.

### [75] [MAPS: Preserving Vision-Language Representations via Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling for Better Vision-Language-Action Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19878)
*Chengyue Huang,Mellon M. Zhang,Robert Azarcon,Glen Chou,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPS is a fine-tuning framework for Vision-Language-Action models that schedules proximity constraints to preserve pretrained VLM priors while allowing action layers to adapt more freely, improving generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive fine-tuning of VLA models disrupts pretrained VLM representations and harms generalization. Existing approaches either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the different roles of VLA components.

Method: MAPS uses module-wise proximity scheduling that linearly relaxes constraints based on an empirical order - keeping visual encoders close to pretrained priors while allowing action-oriented language layers to adapt more freely.

Result: MAPS consistently boosts performance across multiple benchmarks (MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO) and real-world evaluations, achieving up to +30% improvement in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance.

Conclusion: Empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs is a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer, with MAPS providing a practical framework that requires no additional parameters or data.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models inherit strong priors from pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), but naive fine-tuning often disrupts these representations and harms generalization. Existing fixes -- freezing modules or applying uniform regularization -- either overconstrain adaptation or ignore the differing roles of VLA components. We present MAPS (Module-Wise Proximity Scheduling), the first robust fine-tuning framework for VLAs. Through systematic analysis, we uncover an empirical order in which proximity constraints should be relaxed to balance stability and flexibility. MAPS linearly schedules this relaxation, enabling visual encoders to stay close to their pretrained priors while action-oriented language layers adapt more freely. MAPS introduces no additional parameters or data, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLAs. Across MiniVLA-VQ, MiniVLA-OFT, OpenVLA-OFT, and challenging benchmarks such as SimplerEnv, CALVIN, LIBERO, as well as real-world evaluations on the Franka Emika Panda platform, MAPS consistently boosts both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance (up to +30%). Our findings highlight empirically guided proximity to pretrained VLMs as a simple yet powerful principle for preserving broad generalization in VLM-to-VLA transfer.

### [76] [Lightweight Transformer Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19765)
*Ali Torabi,Sanjog Gaihre,Yaqoob Majeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrispFormer improves weakly supervised semantic segmentation by enhancing the SegFormer decoder with boundary supervision, uncertainty-guided refinement, and dynamic multi-scale fusion, achieving better boundary quality and segmentation accuracy without changing the backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of learning dense masks from noisy, under-specified cues in weakly supervised semantic segmentation by improving boundary preservation, handling label noise, and selecting appropriate feature scales.

Method: Augments SegFormer decoder with: (1) boundary branch for object contours using edge head and boundary-aware loss, (2) uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts aleatoric uncertainty to weight losses and correct segmentation logits, (3) dynamic multi-scale fusion with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features.

Result: Consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines while adding minimal computational overhead. Preserves crisp boundaries and resists label noise from weak cues.

Conclusion: CrispFormer provides a simple, decoder-centric approach that is broadly compatible with existing SegFormer variants and offers reproducible improvement in mask quality from image-level supervision without heavy post-processing.

Abstract: Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) must learn dense masks from noisy, under-specified cues. We revisit the SegFormer decoder and show that three small, synergistic changes make weak supervision markedly more effective-without altering the MiT backbone or relying on heavy post-processing. Our method, CrispFormer, augments the decoder with: (1) a boundary branch that supervises thin object contours using a lightweight edge head and a boundary-aware loss; (2) an uncertainty-guided refiner that predicts per-pixel aleatoric uncertainty and uses it to weight losses and gate a residual correction of the segmentation logits; and (3) a dynamic multi-scale fusion layer that replaces static concatenation with spatial softmax gating over multi-resolution features, optionally modulated by uncertainty. The result is a single-pass model that preserves crisp boundaries, selects appropriate scales per location, and resists label noise from weak cues. Integrated into a standard WSSS pipeline (seed, student, and EMA relabeling), CrispFormer consistently improves boundary F-score, small-object recall, and mIoU over SegFormer baselines trained on the same seeds, while adding minimal compute. Our decoder-centric formulation is simple to implement, broadly compatible with existing SegFormer variants, and offers a reproducible path to higher-fidelity masks from image-level supervision.

*Yuefei Chen,Jiang Liu,Xiaodong Lin,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CounterVQA benchmark reveals VLMs struggle with complex counterfactual reasoning in videos, especially multi-hop causal chains. CFGPT method improves this by distilling language modality reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Language Models show strong video understanding but lack counterfactual reasoning capabilities, which is essential for robust understanding beyond pattern recognition.

Method: Created CounterVQA benchmark with 3 difficulty levels, evaluated state-of-the-art models, and developed CFGPT post-training method that distills counterfactual reasoning from language modality.

Result: Models perform reasonably on simple counterfactual questions but degrade significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. CFGPT yields consistent improvements across all difficulty levels.

Conclusion: Counterfactual reasoning remains challenging for VLMs, but CFGPT demonstrates effective enhancement through language modality distillation, with dataset and code to be released.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, especially in feature alignment, event reasoning, and instruction-following tasks. However, their capability for counterfactual reasoning, inferring alternative outcomes under hypothetical conditions, remains underexplored. This capability is essential for robust video understanding, as it requires identifying underlying causal structures and reasoning about unobserved possibilities, rather than merely recognizing observed patterns. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce CounterVQA, a video-based benchmark featuring three progressive difficulty levels that assess different aspects of counterfactual reasoning. Through comprehensive evaluation of both state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source models, we uncover a substantial performance gap: while these models achieve reasonable accuracy on simple counterfactual questions, performance degrades significantly on complex multi-hop causal chains. To address these limitations, we develop a post-training method, CFGPT, that enhances a model's visual counterfactual reasoning ability by distilling its counterfactual reasoning capability from the language modality, yielding consistent improvements across all CounterVQA difficulty levels. Dataset and code will be further released.

*Noah Frahm,Prakrut Patel,Yue Zhang,Shoubin Yu,Mohit Bansal,Roni Sengupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune-Then-Plan framework stabilizes VLM-based embodied question answering by pruning implausible frontier choices and using coverage-based planning, reducing frontier oscillations and improving navigation efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large vision-language models used for embodied question answering exhibit frontier oscillations (unstable back-and-forth movements) due to overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality.

Method: Proposes Prune-Then-Plan framework that prunes implausible frontier choices using Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure, then delegates final decisions to coverage-based planner, converting overconfident predictions into conservative actions.

Result: Achieves relative improvements of up to 49% in visually grounded SPL and 33% in LLM-Match metrics over baselines, with better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.

Conclusion: The separation of pruning and planning effectively stabilizes VLM-based exploration by calibrating step-level behavior, leading to more efficient navigation and improved answer quality in embodied question answering.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have improved embodied question answering (EQA) agents by providing strong semantic priors for open-vocabulary reasoning. However, when used directly for step-level exploration, VLMs often exhibit frontier oscillations, unstable back-and-forth movements caused by overconfidence and miscalibration, leading to inefficient navigation and degraded answer quality. We propose Prune-Then-Plan, a simple and effective framework that stabilizes exploration through step-level calibration. Instead of trusting raw VLM scores, our method prunes implausible frontier choices using a Holm-Bonferroni inspired pruning procedure and then delegates final decisions to a coverage-based planner. This separation converts overconfident predictions into conservative, interpretable actions by relying on human-level judgments to calibrate the step-level behavior of VLMs. Integrated into the 3D-Mem EQA framework, our approach achieves relative improvements of up to 49% and 33% in visually grounded SPL and LLM-Match metrics respectively over baselines. Overall, our method achieves better scene coverage under equal exploration budgets on both OpenEQA and EXPRESS-Bench datasets.

### [79] [One Attention, One Scale: Phase-Aligned Rotary Positional Embeddings for Mixed-Resolution Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19778)
*Haoyu Wu,Jingyi Xu,Qiaomu Miao,Dimitris Samaras,Hieu Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Identifies phase aliasing issue in RoPE interpolation for mixed-resolution diffusion transformers and proposes CRPA, a training-free fix that aligns phases across resolutions by expressing all positions on query's stride.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Linear interpolation on rotary positional embeddings causes attention collapse when mixing tokens from different spatial grids due to incompatible phase sampling rates, leading to blur, artifacts or full collapse in pretrained DiTs.

Method: Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA) - modifies RoPE index map so all Q/K positions are expressed on query's stride, ensuring equal physical distances induce identical phase increments without retraining.

Result: CRPA eliminates the failure mode, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly, enables high-fidelity mixed-resolution generation, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on image and video generation.

Conclusion: CRPA provides an effective training-free solution to the structural phase aliasing problem in RoPE interpolation, enabling robust mixed-resolution generation with pretrained DiTs.

Abstract: We identify a core failure mode that occurs when using the usual linear interpolation on rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for mixed-resolution denoising with Diffusion Transformers. When tokens from different spatial grids are mixed, the attention mechanism collapses. The issue is structural. Linear coordinate remapping forces a single attention head to compare RoPE phases sampled at incompatible rates, creating phase aliasing that destabilizes the score landscape. Pretrained DiTs are especially brittle-many heads exhibit extremely sharp, periodic phase selectivity-so even tiny cross-rate inconsistencies reliably cause blur, artifacts, or full collapse.
  To this end, our main contribution is Cross-Resolution Phase-Aligned Attention (CRPA), a training-free drop-in fix that eliminates this failure at its source. CRPA modifies only the RoPE index map for each attention call: all Q/K positions are expressed on the query's stride so that equal physical distances always induce identical phase increments. This restores the precise phase patterns that DiTs rely on. CRPA is fully compatible with pretrained DiTs, stabilizes all heads and layers uniformly. We demonstrate that CRPA enables high-fidelity and efficient mixed-resolution generation, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on image and video generation.

*Jihan Yao,Achin Kulshrestha,Nathalie Rauschmayr,Reed Roberts,Banghua Zhu,Yulia Tsvetkov,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Latent Representation Probing (LRP) to detect VLMs' uncertainty from internal representations rather than output probabilities, improving abstention accuracy by 7.6% across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs in safety-critical applications need reliable abstention capabilities, especially for STVQA tasks where OCR errors could cause severe consequences. Existing methods fail due to miscalibrated probabilities or semantic agreement requirements.

Method: LRP trains lightweight probes on VLMs' hidden states or attention patterns using three designs: concatenating all layer representations, aggregating visual token attention, and ensembling single-layer probes via majority vote.

Result: LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6% over best baselines across four benchmarks in image and video modalities. Probes generalize across uncertainty sources and datasets, with optimal signals from intermediate layers.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled framework for deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs, enabling VLMs to know when they can't see.

Abstract: As VLMs are deployed in safety-critical applications, their ability to abstain from answering when uncertain becomes crucial for reliability, especially in Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA) tasks. For example, OCR errors like misreading "50 mph" as "60 mph" could cause severe traffic accidents. This leads us to ask: Can VLMs know when they can't see? Existing abstention methods suggest pessimistic answers: they either rely on miscalibrated output probabilities or require semantic agreement unsuitable for OCR tasks. However, this failure may indicate we are looking in the wrong place: uncertainty signals could be hidden in VLMs' internal representations.
  Building on this insight, we propose Latent Representation Probing (LRP): training lightweight probes on hidden states or attention patterns. We explore three probe designs: concatenating representations across all layers, aggregating attention over visual tokens, and ensembling single layer probes by majority vote. Experiments on four benchmarks across image and video modalities show LRP improves abstention accuracy by 7.6\% over best baselines. Our analysis reveals: probes generalize across various uncertainty sources and datasets, and optimal signals emerge from intermediate rather than final layers. This establishes a principled framework for building deployment-ready AI systems by detecting confidence signals from internal states rather than unreliable outputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the common misuse of RoPE in previous video generation works and enable better camera controllability for variable-length videos with out-of-distribution camera trajectories.

Method: Rectifies RoPE misuse by aligning input and target video spatiotemporal positions, and introduces Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE) - a camera-conditioned RoPE phase shift that captures multi-view relationships across input and target videos.

Result: Significant improvements in camera controllability, geometric consistency, and video quality across various trajectories and lengths, with better generalization to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths.

Conclusion: ReDirector effectively integrates camera conditions into RoPE, enabling improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation for camera-controlled video retake generation.

Abstract: We present ReDirector, a novel camera-controlled video retake generation method for dynamically captured variable-length videos. In particular, we rectify a common misuse of RoPE in previous works by aligning the spatiotemporal positions of the input video and the target retake. Moreover, we introduce Rotary Camera Encoding (RoCE), a camera-conditioned RoPE phase shift that captures and integrates multi-view relationships within and across the input and target videos. By integrating camera conditions into RoPE, our method generalizes to out-of-distribution camera trajectories and video lengths, yielding improved dynamic object localization and static background preservation. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements in camera controllability, geometric consistency, and video quality across various trajectories and lengths.

TL;DR: BHD-RAG is a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise with MLLMs to improve Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome diagnosis from CT images, addressing challenges of limited samples and low inter-class differentiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning faces challenges with limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation in Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs) diagnosis. MLLMs show potential but lack domain knowledge and reference features, increasing hallucination risks.

Method: BHD-RAG employs: (1) specialized agent generating CT image descriptions to build multimodal corpus, (2) cosine similarity-based retriever finding relevant image-description pairs, (3) MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis.

Result: Validated on dataset with four DCLD types, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights.

Conclusion: BHD-RAG framework successfully integrates domain expertise with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy while reducing hallucination risks through retrieval-augmented generation.

Abstract: Deep learning methods face dual challenges of limited clinical samples and low inter-class differentiation among Diffuse Cystic Lung Diseases (DCLDs) in advancing Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) diagnosis via Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate diagnostic potential fo such rare diseases, the absence of domain-specific knowledge and referable radiological features intensify hallucination risks. To address this problem, we propose BHD-RAG, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework that integrates DCLD-specific expertise and clinical precedents with MLLMs to improve BHD diagnostic accuracy. BHDRAG employs: (1) a specialized agent generating imaging manifestation descriptions of CT images to construct a multimodal corpus of DCLDs cases. (2) a cosine similarity-based retriever pinpointing relevant imagedescription pairs for query images, and (3) an MLLM synthesizing retrieved evidence with imaging data for diagnosis. BHD-RAG is validated on the dataset involving four types of DCLDs, achieving superior accuracy and generating evidence-based descriptions closely aligned with expert insights.

TL;DR: DesignPref dataset with 12k pairwise UI design comparisons from 20 professional designers shows high disagreement in visual design preferences, revealing the need for personalized models over aggregated approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual design preferences are highly subjective and personalized, but current generative model finetuning relies on aggregated human-annotated preferences that don't capture individual variation.

Method: Created DesignPref dataset with 12k pairwise UI design comparisons annotated by 20 professional designers, then investigated personalization strategies including fine-tuning and RAG pipelines with designer-specific annotations.

Result: Substantial disagreement among designers (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25), with disagreements stemming from differing perceptions of design aspect importance. Personalized models consistently outperformed aggregated baseline models using 20x fewer examples.

Conclusion: Personalized models are essential for accurately predicting individual design preferences, and DesignPref provides the first dataset to support research into modeling individual design taste.

Abstract: Generative models, such as large language models and text-to-image diffusion models, are increasingly used to create visual designs like user interfaces (UIs) and presentation slides. Finetuning and benchmarking these generative models have often relied on datasets of human-annotated design preferences. Yet, due to the subjective and highly personalized nature of visual design, preference varies widely among individuals. In this paper, we study this problem by introducing DesignPref, a dataset of 12k pairwise comparisons of UI design generation annotated by 20 professional designers with multi-level preference ratings. We found that among trained designers, substantial levels of disagreement exist (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.25 for binary preferences). Natural language rationales provided by these designers indicate that disagreements stem from differing perceptions of various design aspect importance and individual preferences. With DesignPref, we demonstrate that traditional majority-voting methods for training aggregated judge models often do not accurately reflect individual preferences. To address this challenge, we investigate multiple personalization strategies, particularly fine-tuning or incorporating designer-specific annotations into RAG pipelines. Our results show that personalized models consistently outperform aggregated baseline models in predicting individual designers' preferences, even when using 20 times fewer examples. Our work provides the first dataset to study personalized visual design evaluation and support future research into modeling individual design taste.

TL;DR: Rectified SpaAttn addresses attention sparsity biases in diffusion transformers for video generation by rectifying attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, achieving significant speedups while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing attention sparsity methods suffer from severe performance degradation due to systematic biases: excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their weights, while complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes loss of relevant attention weights.

Method: Proposes Rectified SpaAttn with two key components: (1) Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation for critical tokens to calculate accurate rectification factors, and (2) Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification for non-critical tokens to ensure rectified gain consistently surpasses induced error.

Result: Achieves up to 3.33x and 2.08x speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1 respectively while maintaining high generation quality. The method is implemented as an open-source Triton kernel.

Conclusion: Rectified SpaAttn effectively addresses attention sparsity biases in diffusion transformers, enabling significant computational efficiency gains without sacrificing video generation quality.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers dominate video generation, but the quadratic complexity of attention computation introduces substantial latency. Attention sparsity reduces computational costs by focusing on critical tokens while ignoring non-critical tokens. However, existing methods suffer from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we revisit attention sparsity and reveal that existing methods induce systematic biases in attention allocation: (1) excessive focus on critical tokens amplifies their attention weights; (2) complete neglect of non-critical tokens causes the loss of relevant attention weights. To address these issues, we propose Rectified SpaAttn, which rectifies attention allocation with implicit full attention reference, thereby enhancing the alignment between sparse and full attention maps. Specifically: (1) for critical tokens, we show that their bias is proportional to the sparse attention weights, with the ratio governed by the amplified weights. Accordingly, we propose Isolated-Pooling Attention Reallocation, which calculates accurate rectification factors by reallocating multimodal pooled weights. (2) for non-critical tokens, recovering attention weights from the pooled query-key yields attention gains but also introduces pooling errors. Therefore, we propose Gain-Aware Pooling Rectification, which ensures that the rectified gain consistently surpasses the induced error. Moreover, we customize and integrate the Rectified SpaAttn kernel using Triton, achieving up to 3.33 and 2.08 times speedups on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively, while maintaining high generation quality. We release Rectified SpaAttn as open-source at https://github.com/BienLuky/Rectified-SpaAttn .

Motivation: To investigate whether understanding truly informs generation in Unified Multimodal Models, addressing a fundamental question in multimodal AI research.

Method: Introduces UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework with controlled synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis of understanding-generation relationships.

Result: Reveals significant understanding-generation gap in reasoning generation and knowledge transfer tasks. CoT reasoning effectively bridges the gap and can be internalized via self-training. Query-based architectures show latent CoT-like properties.

Conclusion: Provides insights for designing unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge understanding and generation gaps, with implications for future multimodal model development.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in Unified Multimodal Models, yet a fundamental question remains: Does understanding truly inform generation? To investigate this, we introduce UniSandbox, a decoupled evaluation framework paired with controlled, synthetic datasets to avoid data leakage and enable detailed analysis. Our findings reveal a significant understanding-generation gap, which is mainly reflected in two key dimensions: reasoning generation and knowledge transfer. Specifically, for reasoning generation tasks, we observe that explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in the understanding module effectively bridges the gap, and further demonstrate that a self-training approach can successfully internalize this ability, enabling implicit reasoning during generation. Additionally, for knowledge transfer tasks, we find that CoT assists the generative process by helping retrieve newly learned knowledge, and also discover that query-based architectures inherently exhibit latent CoT-like properties that affect this transfer. UniSandbox provides preliminary insights for designing future unified architectures and training strategies that truly bridge the gap between understanding and generation.

TL;DR: 4DWorldBench is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating World Generation Models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency, using unified multimodal evaluation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack unified assessment of world-realism capability in World Models, which aim to create realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds for applications in VR, autonomous driving, and embodied intelligence.

Method: The benchmark introduces adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, mapping all modality conditions into unified textual space, and integrates LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based evaluation methods.

Result: Preliminary human studies show the adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments, providing more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence.

Conclusion: 4DWorldBench serves as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from visual generation to world generation in multimodal AI systems.

Abstract: World Generation Models are emerging as a cornerstone of next-generation multimodal intelligence systems. Unlike traditional 2D visual generation, World Models aim to construct realistic, dynamic, and physically consistent 3D/4D worlds from images, videos, or text. These models not only need to produce high-fidelity visual content but also maintain coherence across space, time, physics, and instruction control, enabling applications in virtual reality, autonomous driving, embodied intelligence, and content creation. However, prior benchmarks emphasize different evaluation dimensions and lack a unified assessment of world-realism capability. To systematically evaluate World Models, we introduce the 4DWorldBench, which measures models across four key dimensions: Perceptual Quality, Condition-4D Alignment, Physical Realism, and 4D Consistency. The benchmark covers tasks such as Image-to-3D/4D, Video-to-4D, Text-to-3D/4D. Beyond these, we innovatively introduce adaptive conditioning across multiple modalities, which not only integrates but also extends traditional evaluation paradigms. To accommodate different modality-conditioned inputs, we map all modality conditions into a unified textual space during evaluation, and further integrate LLM-as-judge, MLLM-as-judge, and traditional network-based methods. This unified and adaptive design enables more comprehensive and consistent evaluation of alignment, physical realism, and cross-modal coherence. Preliminary human studies further demonstrate that our adaptive tool selection achieves closer agreement with subjective human judgments. We hope this benchmark will serve as a foundation for objective comparisons and improvements, accelerating the transition from "visual generation" to "world generation."

### [87] [Face, Whole-Person, and Object Classification in a Unified Space Via The Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19846)
*Thomas M Metz,Matthew Q Hill,Alice J O'Toole*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method called Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC) enables vision foundation models to perform multiple tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high/low-quality images, and person recognition) simultaneously in a single embedding space without catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision foundation models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned for specific tasks like face/person recognition, losing their generalized object classification capabilities. The goal is to create models that can handle multiple vision tasks concurrently while maintaining foundation model properties.

Method: Introduces two variants of IMIC - a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes foundation backbones (DINOv3, CLIP, EVA-02) simultaneously on all four tasks, preventing catastrophic forgetting through coordinated training across domains.

Result: EVA-02 and CLIP with IMIC performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans. The approach maintained out-of-distribution generalization. Analysis showed linearly separable representations with substantial feature sharing - fewer than 100 PCs from any task could perform all other tasks with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: IMIC successfully enables vision foundation models to handle multiple specialized tasks simultaneously without catastrophic forgetting, maintaining foundation model generalization properties while achieving expert-level performance across domains.

Abstract: Vision foundation models can perform generalized object classification in zero-shot mode, and face/person recognition when they are fine-tuned. However, fine-tuned models suffer from catastrophic forgetting. We create models that perform four tasks (object recognition, face recognition from high- and low-quality images, and person recognition from whole-body images) in a single embedding space -- without incurring substantial catastrophic forgetting. To accomplish this, we introduce two variants of the Interleaved Multi-Domain Identity Curriculum (IMIC): a gradient-coupled, interleaving training schedule that fine-tunes a foundation backbone simultaneously on all four tasks. The IMIC method proved effective with three foundation model bases: DINOv3, CLIP, and EVA-02. Two of these (EVA-02 and CLIP) performed comparably with domain experts on all four tasks concurrently and were more accurate than humans at multi-tasking across face, body, and object datasets. Further, we demonstrate that our approach does not substantially harm out-of-distribution generalization, thus maintaining a key property of foundation models. Analysis of the most accurate model variants (EVA-02 + IMIC A and B) showed linearly separable representations of the four tasks in the unified embedding space, but with substantial sharing of features across tasks. Fewer than 100 PCs calculated from any one task could perform all other tasks with nearly zero performance degradation.

*Jiahui Sun,Junran Lu,Jinhui Yin,Yishuo Xu,Yuanqi Li,Yanwen Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOGE introduces a Bézier Graph representation for road extraction from aerial imagery, using differentiable optimization without requiring vector ground-truth, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods use polylines that poorly model curvilinear road geometry, while obtaining vector ground-truth for curve-based representations is difficult.

Method: DOGE learns parametric Bézier Graphs directly from segmentation masks via global optimization, alternating between DiffAlign (continuous geometry optimization) and TopoAdapt (discrete topology refinement).

Result: Sets new state-of-the-art on SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks for road network extraction.

Conclusion: Presents a new paradigm for generating high-fidelity vector maps without curve ground-truth, with code and data to be released.

Abstract: Automatic extraction of road networks from aerial imagery is a fundamental task, yet prevailing methods rely on polylines that struggle to model curvilinear geometry. We maintain that road geometry is inherently curve-based and introduce the Bézier Graph, a differentiable parametric curve-based representation. The primary obstacle to this representation is to obtain the difficult-to-construct vector ground-truth (GT). We sidestep this bottleneck by reframing the task as a global optimization problem over the Bézier Graph. Our framework, DOGE, operationalizes this paradigm by learning a parametric Bézier Graph directly from segmentation masks, eliminating the need for curve GT. DOGE holistically optimizes the graph by alternating between two complementary modules: DiffAlign continuously optimizes geometry via differentiable rendering, while TopoAdapt uses discrete operators to refine its topology. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale SpaceNet and CityScale benchmarks, presenting a new paradigm for generating high-fidelity vector maps of road networks. We will release our code and related data.

*Jiankuo Zhao,Xiangyu Zhu,Zidu Wang,Zhen Lei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAvatar is a novel method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D head avatars from monocular videos that addresses limitations of existing Gaussian Splatting approaches through UV-Adaptive Soft Binding and Temporal Adaptive Density Control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting bind Gaussians to mesh triangles using Linear Blend Skinning, resulting in rigid motion, limited expressiveness, and poor handling of frequently occluded regions like mouth interiors and eyelids.

Method: Proposes two key components: (1) UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that uses image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets in UV space, supporting dynamic resampling and compatibility with Adaptive Density Control; (2) Temporal ADC strategy that clusters similar frames and introduces fused perceptual error as clone criterion to capture geometric and textural discrepancies.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions.

Conclusion: STAvatar achieves superior 3D head avatar reconstruction from monocular videos by addressing rigid motion limitations and improving handling of occluded regions through its novel UV-Adaptive Soft Binding and Temporal ADC strategies.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity and animatable 3D head avatars from monocular videos remains a challenging yet essential task. Existing methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting typically bind Gaussians to mesh triangles and model deformations solely via Linear Blend Skinning, which results in rigid motion and limited expressiveness. Moreover, they lack specialized strategies to handle frequently occluded regions (e.g., mouth interiors, eyelids). To address these limitations, we propose STAvatar, which consists of two key components: (1) a UV-Adaptive Soft Binding framework that leverages both image-based and geometric priors to learn per-Gaussian feature offsets within the UV space. This UV representation supports dynamic resampling, ensuring full compatibility with Adaptive Density Control (ADC) and enhanced adaptability to shape and textural variations. (2) a Temporal ADC strategy, which first clusters structurally similar frames to facilitate more targeted computation of the densification criterion. It further introduces a novel fused perceptual error as clone criterion to jointly capture geometric and textural discrepancies, encouraging densification in regions requiring finer details. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that STAvatar achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, especially in capturing fine-grained details and reconstructing frequently occluded regions. The code will be publicly available.

TL;DR: TimeArtist is a temporal-visual conversion framework that achieves semantic-level alignment between time series and visual concepts, enabling high-quality image generation from time series data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to establish semantic-level alignment between time series and visual content, and the potential of using non-visual continuous sequential data for image generation remains unexplored.

Method: Uses a 'warmup-align' paradigm with dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer trained self-supervised on large datasets, followed by frozen encoders and quantizer with a projection layer for temporal-visual alignment.

Result: Achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics and superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks, enabling diverse image generation directly from time series while capturing temporal patterns.

Conclusion: Establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation that bridges the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in aligning and generating content across text and image modalities. However, the potential of using non-visual, continuous sequential, as a conditioning signal for high-fidelity image generation remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, existing methods that convert series into "pseudo-images" for temporal forecasting fail to establish semantic-level alignment. In this paper, we propose TimeArtist, a temporal-visual conversion framework that pioneers semantic-level alignment between time series fluctuations and visual concepts. It pioneers a "warmup-align" paradigm: first, a dual-autoencoder and shared quantizer are self-supervised trained on large-scale datasets to learn modality-shared representations. Then, the encoders and quantizer are frozen, and a projection is introduced to align temporal and visual samples at the representation level. TimeArtist establishes a versatile cross-modal framework, enabling high-quality, diverse image generation directly from time series, while capturing temporal fluctuation patterns to render images as styles transfer. Extensive experiments show that TimeArtist achieves satisfactory performance in image generation metrics, while also attaining superior results in zero-shot temporal tasks. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal generation, bridging the gap between temporal dynamics and visual semantics.

Conclusion: GigaWorld-0 provides a scalable data engine for VLA learning that enables effective robot training purely through synthetic data generation, significantly improving generalization and task success.

Abstract: World models are emerging as a foundational paradigm for scalable, data-efficient embodied AI. In this work, we present GigaWorld-0, a unified world model framework designed explicitly as a data engine for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) learning. GigaWorld-0 integrates two synergistic components: GigaWorld-0-Video, which leverages large-scale video generation to produce diverse, texture-rich, and temporally coherent embodied sequences under fine-grained control of appearance, camera viewpoint, and action semantics; and GigaWorld-0-3D, which combines 3D generative modeling, 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, physically differentiable system identification, and executable motion planning to ensure geometric consistency and physical realism. Their joint optimization enables the scalable synthesis of embodied interaction data that is visually compelling, spatially coherent, physically plausible, and instruction-aligned. Training at scale is made feasible through our efficient GigaTrain framework, which exploits FP8-precision and sparse attention to drastically reduce memory and compute requirements. We conduct comprehensive evaluations showing that GigaWorld-0 generates high-quality, diverse, and controllable data across multiple dimensions. Critically, VLA model (e.g., GigaBrain-0) trained on GigaWorld-0-generated data achieve strong real-world performance, significantly improving generalization and task success on physical robots without any real-world interaction during training.

TL;DR: ChessMamba introduces a structure-aware framework using interleaved state-space modeling for robust change detection in multitemporal remote sensing imagery, addressing heterogeneity and spatiotemporal misalignment issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods based on vision transformers or state-space models disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization.

Method: Integrates SpatialMamba encoder with lightweight cross-source interaction module using Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order and structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions to serialize multi-temporal features into unified sequences.

Result: Achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods across three CD tasks: binary CD, semantic CD, and multimodal building damage assessment.

Conclusion: ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and enables robust change detection with improved localization accuracy in multitemporal remote sensing imagery.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) in multitemporal remote sensing imagery presents significant challenges for fine-grained recognition, owing to heterogeneity and spatiotemporal misalignment. However, existing methodologies based on vision transformers or state-space models typically disrupt local structural consistency during temporal serialization, obscuring discriminative cues under misalignment and hindering reliable change localization. To address this, we introduce ChessMamba, a structure-aware framework leveraging interleaved state-space modeling for robust CD with multi-temporal inputs. ChessMamba integrates a SpatialMamba encoder with a lightweight cross-source interaction module, featuring two key innovations: (i) Chessboard interleaving with snake scanning order, which serializes multi-temporal features into a unified sequence within a single forward pass, thereby shortening interaction paths and enabling direct comparison for accurate change localization; and (ii) Structure-aware fusion via multi-dilated convolutions, selectively capturing center-and-corner neighborhood contexts within each mono-temporal. Comprehensive evaluations on three CD tasks, including binary CD, semantic CD and multimodal building damage assessment, demonstrate that ChessMamba effectively fuses heterogeneous features and achieves substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art methods.The relevant code will be available at: github.com/DingLei14/ChessMamba.

*Junhong Liu,Yuan Zhang,Tao Huang,Wenchao Xu,Renyu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation method that separates low and high-frequency features for better knowledge transfer between vision and language modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation struggles in cross-modal scenarios due to representation inconsistencies between modalities like vision and language.

Method: Decouples frequency-domain features, applies strong alignment for consistent low-frequency features and relaxed alignment for dissimilar high-frequency features, with scale consistency loss and shared classifier.

Result: Substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Frequency decoupling effectively addresses cross-modal representation inconsistencies and enables more effective knowledge distillation between different modalities.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has proven highly effective for compressing large models and enhancing the performance of smaller ones. However, its effectiveness diminishes in cross-modal scenarios, such as vision-to-language distillation, where inconsistencies in representation across modalities lead to difficult knowledge transfer. To address this challenge, we propose frequency-decoupled cross-modal knowledge distillation, a method designed to decouple and balance knowledge transfer across modalities by leveraging frequency-domain features. We observed that low-frequency features exhibit high consistency across different modalities, whereas high-frequency features demonstrate extremely low cross-modal similarity. Accordingly, we apply distinct losses to these features: enforcing strong alignment in the low-frequency domain and introducing relaxed alignment for high-frequency features. We also propose a scale consistency loss to address distributional shifts between modalities, and employ a shared classifier to unify feature spaces. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show our method substantially outperforms traditional KD and state-of-the-art cross-modal KD approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CAD datasets are limited to single tasks, constraining the development of CAD technology for liver lesion evaluation and treatment.

Method: Created LiMT dataset with 150 CT volumes covering four liver diseases and normal cases, annotated by clinicians, supporting multiple tasks including segmentation, classification, and detection.

Result: Provides a public multi-task dataset with baseline experimental results, enabling exploration of task correlations without dataset heterogeneity issues during training.

Conclusion: LiMT dataset serves as a valuable resource for medical imaging research, facilitating multi-task learning approaches for liver-related CAD applications.

Abstract: Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology can assist clinicians in evaluating liver lesions and intervening with treatment in time. Although CAD technology has advanced in recent years, the application scope of existing datasets remains relatively limited, typically supporting only single tasks, which has somewhat constrained the development of CAD technology. To address the above limitation, in this paper, we construct a multi-task liver dataset (LiMT) used for liver and tumor segmentation, multi-label lesion classification, and lesion detection based on arterial phase-enhanced computed tomography (CT), potentially providing an exploratory solution that is able to explore the correlation between tasks and does not need to worry about the heterogeneity between task-specific datasets during training. The dataset includes CT volumes from 150 different cases, comprising four types of liver diseases as well as normal cases. Each volume has been carefully annotated and calibrated by experienced clinicians. This public multi-task dataset may become a valuable resource for the medical imaging research community in the future. In addition, this paper not only provides relevant baseline experimental results but also reviews existing datasets and methods related to liver-related tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-source LVLMs struggle with SVQA due to lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets, and existing synthetic datasets contain systematic errors from LVLM limitations and figure-text information asymmetry.

Method: A verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that generates QA pairs with figure context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks and auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs.

Result: Created VeriSciQA with 20,351 QA pairs across 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types, showing substantial accuracy gap between open-source (64%) and proprietary models (82%), with fine-tuned models achieving consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: The scalable framework enables continued data expansion to advance SVQA capability in the open-source community, with human evaluation confirming VeriSciQA's superior correctness.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) show promise for scientific applications, yet open-source models still struggle with Scientific Visual Question Answering (SVQA), namely answering questions about figures from scientific papers. A key bottleneck lies in the lack of public, large-scale, high-quality SVQA datasets. Although recent work uses LVLMs to synthesize data at scale, we identify systematic errors in their resulting QA pairs, stemming from LVLMs' inherent limitations and information asymmetry between figures and text. To address these challenges, we propose a verification-centric Generate-then-Verify framework that first generates QA pairs with figure-associated textual context, then applies cross-modal consistency checks against figures along with auxiliary filters to eliminate erroneous pairs. We instantiate this framework to curate VeriSciQA, a dataset of 20,351 QA pairs spanning 20 scientific domains and 12 figure types. VeriSciQA poses a challenging benchmark for open-source models, with a substantial accuracy gap between the leading open-source models (64%) and a proprietary model (82%). Moreover, models fine-tuned on VeriSciQA achieve consistent improvements on SVQA benchmarks, with performance gains that scale with data size and surpass models trained on existing datasets. Human evaluation further validates the superior correctness of VeriSciQA. Together, these evidences demonstrate that continued data expansion by our scalable framework can further advance SVQA capability in the open-source community.

Motivation: To overcome limitations of human-annotated supervision in vision-language agents and address issues with text-based self-evaluation that struggles with complex visual reasoning and suffers from evaluation hallucinations.

Method: Unifies two roles in a single LVLM: a Solver for multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. Uses Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle with tool-based verification and reinforcement learning.

Result: Achieves 12.5% improvement over the base model on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis tasks through zero-external-reward evolution.

Conclusion: Agent0-VL successfully enables continual self-improvement by aligning reasoning and verification behaviors without human annotation or external reward models, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool-integrated reasoning for self-evolution.

Abstract: Vision-language agents have achieved remarkable progress in a variety of multimodal reasoning tasks; however, their learning remains constrained by the limitations of human-annotated supervision. Recent self-rewarding approaches attempt to overcome this constraint by allowing models to act as their own critics or reward providers. Yet, purely text-based self-evaluation struggles to verify complex visual reasoning steps and often suffers from evaluation hallucinations. To address these challenges, inspired by recent advances in tool-integrated reasoning, we propose Agent0-VL, a self-evolving vision-language agent that achieves continual improvement with tool-integrated reasoning. Agent0-VL incorporates tool usage not only into reasoning but also into self-evaluation and self-repair, enabling the model to introspect, verify, and refine its reasoning through evidence-grounded analysis. It unifies two synergistic roles within a single LVLM: a Solver that performs multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning, and a Verifier that generates structured feedback and fine-grained self-rewards through tool-grounded critique. These roles interact through a Self-Evolving Reasoning Cycle, where tool-based verification and reinforcement learning jointly align the reasoning and evaluation distributions for stable self-improvement. Through this zero-external-reward evolution, Agent0-VL aligns its reasoning and verification behaviors without any human annotation or external reward models, achieving continual self-improvement. Experiments on geometric problem solving and visual scientific analysis show that Agent0-VL achieves an 12.5% improvement over the base model.

TL;DR: A multimodal approach for continuous ASL sign recognition using 3D skeletal features and handshape classification to detect sign boundaries, followed by sign recognition trained on both isolated and continuous signing data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve continuous sign language recognition by accurately detecting sign boundaries and recognizing segmented signs, addressing the challenges of boundary detection and differences between citation-form and continuous signing.

Method: Uses 3D skeletal features for boundary detection, pretrains handshape classifier on 87 canonical categories, multimodal fusion of video segmentation and handshape models, and sign recognition trained on both isolated and continuous signing data.

Result: Significant improvements over previous work when evaluated on the ASLLRP corpus.

Conclusion: The multimodal approach combining 3D skeletal features and handshape information effectively improves continuous sign recognition performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a multimodal approach for continuous sign recognition that first uses machine learning to detect the start and end frames of signs in videos of American Sign Language (ASL) sentences, and then recognizes the segmented signs. For improved robustness, we use 3D skeletal features extracted from sign language videos to capture the convergence of sign properties and their dynamics, which tend to cluster at sign boundaries. Another focus of this work is the incorporation of information from 3D handshape for boundary detection. To detect handshapes normally expected at the beginning and end of signs, we pretrain a handshape classifier for 87 linguistically defined canonical handshape categories using a dataset that we created by integrating and normalizing several existing datasets. A multimodal fusion module is then used to unify the pretrained sign video segmentation framework and the handshape classification models. Finally, the estimated boundaries are used for sign recognition, where the recognition model is trained on a large database containing both citation-form isolated signs and signs pre-segmented (based on manual annotations) from continuous signing, as such signs often differ in certain respects. We evaluate our method on the ASLLRP corpus and demonstrate significant improvements over previous work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion Marionette is a zero-shot framework for rigid motion transfer from source videos to target images using internal spatial-temporal priors instead of external constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods use external priors (geometric, generative, or simulation) that create trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. The goal is to overcome these limitations by using internal priors that capture spatial-temporal transformations.

Method: Lift source video and target image into unified 3D representation space, extract motion trajectories to create spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior, integrate with target object to synthesize controllable velocity field, and refine using Position-Based Dynamics.

Result: The framework generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos aligned with source motion, and supports controllable video generation.

Conclusion: Motion Marionette effectively transfers rigid motion using internal spatial-temporal priors, achieving better generalizability and temporal consistency than methods relying on external constraints.

Abstract: We present Motion Marionette, a zero-shot framework for rigid motion transfer from monocular source videos to single-view target images. Previous works typically employ geometric, generative, or simulation priors to guide the transfer process, but these external priors introduce auxiliary constraints that lead to trade-offs between generalizability and temporal consistency. To address these limitations, we propose guiding the motion transfer process through an internal prior that exclusively captures the spatial-temporal transformations and is shared between the source video and any transferred target video. Specifically, we first lift both the source video and the target image into a unified 3D representation space. Motion trajectories are then extracted from the source video to construct a spatial-temporal (SpaT) prior that is independent of object geometry and semantics, encoding relative spatial variations over time. This prior is further integrated with the target object to synthesize a controllable velocity field, which is subsequently refined using Position-Based Dynamics to mitigate artifacts and enhance visual coherence. The resulting velocity field can be flexibly employed for efficient video production. Empirical results demonstrate that Motion Marionette generalizes across diverse objects, produces temporally consistent videos that align well with the source motion, and supports controllable video generation.

Conclusion: Reasoning-VLA provides a general and fast action-generation framework that effectively addresses inference efficiency and generalization challenges in autonomous driving VLA models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown strong decision-making capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing VLAs often struggle with achieving efficient inference and generalizing to novel autonomous vehicle configurations and driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose Reasoning-VLA, a general and fast action-generation VLA framework. The proposed model employs a set of learnable action queries, initialized via Gaussian sampling from ground-truth trajectories within the training corpus. These learnable queries interact with reasoning-enhanced vision-language features to generate continuous action trajectories in parallel. To promote robust generalization, we consolidate eight publicly available autonomous driving datasets into a standardized, Chain-of-Thought reasoning-based, and easy-to-use data format for model training. Leveraging both supervised learning and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, extensive empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Reasoning-VLA achieves state-of-the-art performance, superior generalization capability, and the excellent inference speed reported to date.

Result: Enables breakthrough virtual chemical characterization, eliminating need for traditional post-print measurements and allowing precise control over chemical conversion state.

Conclusion: The framework successfully predicts dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data by explicitly modeling physical coupling through multimodal fusion.

Abstract: We present a framework that pioneers the prediction of photochemical conversion in complex three-dimensionally printed objects, introducing a challenging new computer vision task: predicting dense, non-visual volumetric physical properties from 3D visual data. This approach leverages the largest-ever optically printed 3D specimen dataset, comprising a large family of parametrically designed complex minimal surface structures that have undergone terminal chemical characterisation. Conventional vision models are ill-equipped for this task, as they lack an inductive bias for the coupled, non-linear interactions of optical physics (diffraction, absorption) and material physics (diffusion, convection) that govern the final chemical state. To address this, we propose Coupled Physics-Gated Adaptation (C-PGA), a novel multimodal fusion architecture. Unlike standard concatenation, C-PGA explicitly models physical coupling by using sparse geometrical and process parameters (e.g., surface transport, print layer height) as a Query to dynamically gate and adapt the dense visual features via feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). This mechanism spatially modulates dual 3D visual streams-extracted by parallel 3D-CNNs processing raw projection stacks and their diffusion-diffraction corrected counterparts allowing the model to recalibrate its visual perception based on the physical context. This approach offers a breakthrough in virtual chemical characterisation, eliminating the need for traditional post-print measurements and enabling precise control over the chemical conversion state.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoTTS introduces localized test-time scaling for diffusion models, adaptively resampling only defective regions while preserving high-quality areas, achieving better quality with 2-4x GPU cost reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing test-time scaling methods operate at full-image level, wasting computation on satisfactory regions and inadequately correcting localized defects, while image quality is spatially heterogeneous.

Method: LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts to identify defective regions, then refines them into coherent masks and perturbs only defective regions for local denoising while keeping the rest of the image undisturbed.

Result: Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX show LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving both local quality and global fidelity while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling.

Conclusion: Localized test-time scaling is established as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time, with LoTTS being the first fully training-free framework for this approach.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become the dominant paradigm in text-to-image generation, and test-time scaling (TTS) further improves quality by allocating more computation during inference. However, existing TTS methods operate at the full-image level, overlooking the fact that image quality is often spatially heterogeneous. This leads to unnecessary computation on already satisfactory regions and insufficient correction of localized defects. In this paper, we explore a new direction - Localized TTS - that adaptively resamples defective regions while preserving high-quality regions, thereby substantially reducing the search space. This paradigm poses two central challenges: accurately localizing defects and maintaining global consistency. We propose LoTTS, the first fully training-free framework for localized TTS. For defect localization, LoTTS contrasts cross- and self-attention signals under quality-aware prompts (e.g., high-quality vs. low-quality) to identify defective regions, and then refines them into coherent masks. For consistency, LoTTS perturbs only defective regions and denoises them locally, ensuring that corrections remain confined while the rest of the image remains undisturbed. Extensive experiments on SD2.1, SDXL, and FLUX demonstrate that LoTTS achieves state-of-the-art performance: it consistently improves both local quality and global fidelity, while reducing GPU cost by 2-4x compared to Best-of-N sampling. These findings establish localized TTS as a promising new direction for scaling diffusion models at inference time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybriDLA is a generative framework combining diffusion and autoregressive decoding for document layout analysis, achieving state-of-the-art 83.5% mAP on modern documents with complex layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional DLA methods struggle with modern documents that have diverse element counts and complex layouts, requiring a more flexible approach than fixed query sets.

Method: Unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding in a single layer, with diffusion refining bounding-box hypotheses and autoregressive adding semantic context, plus a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder.

Result: Achieves 83.5% mean Average Precision, outperforming previous approaches on DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks.

Conclusion: HybriDLA sets state-of-the-art performance for document layout analysis and will be publicly available.

Abstract: Conventional document layout analysis (DLA) traditionally depends on empirical priors or a fixed set of learnable queries executed in a single forward pass. While sufficient for early-generation documents with a small, predetermined number of regions, this paradigm struggles with contemporary documents, which exhibit diverse element counts and increasingly complex layouts. To address challenges posed by modern documents, we present HybriDLA, a novel generative framework that unifies diffusion and autoregressive decoding within a single layer. The diffusion component iteratively refines bounding-box hypotheses, whereas the autoregressive component injects semantic and contextual awareness, enabling precise region prediction even in highly varied layouts. To further enhance detection quality, we design a multi-scale feature-fusion encoder that captures both fine-grained and high-level visual cues. This architecture elevates performance to 83.5% mean Average Precision (mAP). Extensive experiments on the DocLayNet and M$^6$Doc benchmarks demonstrate that HybriDLA sets a state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous approaches. All data and models will be made publicly available at https://yufanchen96.github.io/projects/HybriDLA.

TL;DR: DetVLM is a novel image retrieval framework that combines object detection with Visual Large Models to enable state-specific and zero-shot search capabilities for fine-grained component analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional methods: manual features lack robustness, deep learning detectors can't perform state-specific or zero-shot retrieval, and VLMs have poor spatial grounding and high computational costs.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: YOLO detector first performs efficient component-level screening, then VLM acts as recall-enhancement unit for secondary verification of missed components, enabling state search and zero-shot capabilities.

Result: Achieves 94.82% overall retrieval accuracy on vehicle component dataset, 94.95% accuracy in zero-shot mask-wearing search, and over 90% average accuracy in state search tasks.

Conclusion: DetVLM successfully bridges gaps in fine-grained image retrieval by synergistically fusing detection and VLM capabilities, enabling advanced state-specific and zero-shot search functionalities.

Abstract: Fine-grained image retrieval, which aims to find images containing specific object components and assess their detailed states, is critical in fields like security and industrial inspection. However, conventional methods face significant limitations: manual features (e.g., SIFT) lack robustness; deep learning-based detectors (e.g., YOLO) can identify component presence but cannot perform state-specific retrieval or zero-shot search; Visual Large Models (VLMs) offer semantic and zero-shot capabilities but suffer from poor spatial grounding and high computational cost, making them inefficient for direct retrieval. To bridge these gaps, this paper proposes DetVLM, a novel intelligent image search framework that synergistically fuses object detection with VLMs. The framework pioneers a search-enhancement paradigm via a two-stage pipeline: a YOLO detector first conducts efficient, high-recall component-level screening to determine component presence; then, a VLM acts as a recall-enhancement unit, performing secondary verification for components missed by the detector. This architecture directly enables two advanced capabilities: 1) State Search: Guided by task-specific prompts, the VLM refines results by verifying component existence and executing sophisticated state judgments (e.g., "sun visor lowered"), allowing retrieval based on component state. 2) Zero-shot Search: The framework leverages the VLM's inherent zero-shot capability to recognize and retrieve images containing unseen components or attributes (e.g., "driver wearing a mask") without any task-specific training. Experiments on a vehicle component dataset show DetVLM achieves a state-of-the-art overall retrieval accuracy of 94.82\%, significantly outperforming detection-only baselines. It also attains 94.95\% accuracy in zero-shot search for driver mask-wearing and over 90\% average accuracy in state search tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPDATrack is a Transformer-based tracker that suppresses background and distractor interference through token pruning and selective attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing one-stream Transformer trackers suffer from excessive background tokens attending to target templates, weakening discriminative capability, while current pruning methods often remove important contextual information near the target.

Method: Integrates a learnable module to estimate target association probabilities, prunes less-informative background tokens while preserving context, employs discriminative selective attention to block search-to-template attention in early layers, and selectively extracts high-probability target tokens in later layers.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with 75.1% average overlap on GOT-10k.

Conclusion: CPDATrack effectively suppresses background and distractor interference while maintaining computational efficiency, demonstrating superior tracking performance through targeted token management and selective attention mechanisms.

Abstract: One-stream Transformer-based trackers have demonstrated remarkable performance by concatenating template and search region tokens, thereby enabling joint attention across all tokens. However, enabling an excessive proportion of background search tokens to attend to the target template tokens weakens the tracker's discriminative capability. Several token pruning methods have been proposed to mitigate background interference; however, they often remove tokens near the target, leading to the loss of essential contextual information and degraded tracking performance. Moreover, the presence of distractors within the search tokens further reduces the tracker's ability to accurately identify the target. To address these limitations, we propose CPDATrack, a novel tracking framework designed to suppress interference from background and distractor tokens while enhancing computational efficiency. First, a learnable module is integrated between two designated encoder layers to estimate the probability of each search token being associated with the target. Based on these estimates, less-informative background tokens are pruned from the search region while preserving the contextual cues surrounding the target. To further suppress background interference, a discriminative selective attention mechanism is employed that fully blocks search-to-template attention in the early layers. In the subsequent encoder layers, high-probability target tokens are selectively extracted from a localized region to attend to the template tokens, thereby reducing the influence of background and distractor tokens. The proposed CPDATrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly on GOT-10k, where it attains an average overlap of 75.1 percent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Image diffusion models capture rich semantic structures that can be repurposed for recognition and localization tasks beyond image generation.

Method: Reinterpret self-attention maps as semantic label propagation kernels, extend to temporal propagation for video tracking, use test-time optimization (DDIM inversion, textual inversion, adaptive head weighting), and integrate SAM for mask refinement.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Diffusion models' self-attention mechanisms provide robust semantic correspondences that enable effective zero-shot object tracking in videos when combined with optimization strategies and mask refinement.

Abstract: Image diffusion models, though originally developed for image generation, implicitly capture rich semantic structures that enable various recognition and localization tasks beyond synthesis. In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image editing approaches are limited to low-resolution settings (typically up to 1K), while high-resolution content creation is emerging as a central challenge requiring effective controllable manipulation mechanisms.

Method: Patch-wise optimization on high-resolution source images, followed by fine-grained detail transfer module and novel synchronization strategy to maintain consistency across patches.

Conclusion: The proposed framework addresses the challenge of high-resolution image editing and enables effective high-resolution content creation.

Abstract: High-resolution content creation is rapidly emerging as a central challenge in both the vision and graphics communities. While images serve as the most fundamental modality for visual expression, content generation that aligns with the user intent requires effective, controllable high-resolution image manipulation mechanisms. However, existing approaches remain limited to low-resolution settings, typically supporting only up to 1K resolution. In this work, we introduce the task of high-resolution image editing and propose a test-time optimization framework to address it. Our method performs patch-wise optimization on high-resolution source images, followed by a fine-grained detail transfer module and a novel synchronization strategy to maintain consistency across patches. Extensive experiments show that our method produces high-quality edits, facilitating the way toward high-resolution content creation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing nuclear segmentation methods rely on dense supervision and expensive fine-tuning, while training-free approaches remain underexplored despite their potential for scalable pathology applications.

Method: Leverages histology-informed priors to create slide-specific reference prototypes, uses partial optimal transport for feature alignment, and transforms features into positive/negative point prompts for SAM without parameter updates.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks show SPROUT achieves competitive performance without any supervision or retraining.

Conclusion: SPROUT establishes a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in computational pathology.

Abstract: Accurate nuclear instance segmentation is a pivotal task in computational pathology, supporting data-driven clinical insights and facilitating downstream translational applications. While large vision foundation models have shown promise for zero-shot biomedical segmentation, most existing approaches still depend on dense supervision and computationally expensive fine-tuning. Consequently, training-free methods present a compelling research direction, yet remain largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce SPROUT, a fully training- and annotation-free prompting framework for nuclear instance segmentation. SPROUT leverages histology-informed priors to construct slide-specific reference prototypes that mitigate domain gaps. These prototypes progressively guide feature alignment through a partial optimal transport scheme. The resulting foreground and background features are transformed into positive and negative point prompts, enabling the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to produce precise nuclear delineations without any parameter updates. Extensive experiments across multiple histopathology benchmarks demonstrate that SPROUT achieves competitive performance without supervision or retraining, establishing a novel paradigm for scalable, training-free nuclear instance segmentation in pathology.

TL;DR: GFT-GCN is a privacy-preserving 3D face recognition framework that combines spectral graph learning with diffusion-based template protection to secure biometric data while maintaining high recognition accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D face recognition provides robust biometric authentication but requires protection of stored templates against security threats. Current systems need privacy-preserving solutions that maintain performance while securing biometric data.

Method: Integrates Graph Fourier Transform (GCN) and Graph Convolutional Networks to extract spectral features from 3D face meshes, then applies spectral diffusion for template protection. Uses client-server architecture to keep raw biometric data on client devices.

Result: Experiments on BU-3DFE and FaceScape datasets show high recognition accuracy and strong resistance to reconstruction attacks. The framework effectively balances privacy protection with performance.

Conclusion: GFT-GCN offers a practical solution for secure 3D face authentication by combining spectral graph learning with diffusion-based template protection, achieving both privacy and performance objectives.

Abstract: 3D face recognition offers a robust biometric solution by capturing facial geometry, providing resilience to variations in illumination, pose changes, and presentation attacks. Its strong spoof resistance makes it suitable for high-security applications, but protecting stored biometric templates remains critical. We present GFT-GCN, a privacy-preserving 3D face recognition framework that combines spectral graph learning with diffusion-based template protection. Our approach integrates the Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to extract compact, discriminative spectral features from 3D face meshes. To secure these features, we introduce a spectral diffusion mechanism that produces irreversible, renewable, and unlinkable templates. A lightweight client-server architecture ensures that raw biometric data never leaves the client device. Experiments on the BU-3DFE and FaceScape datasets demonstrate high recognition accuracy and strong resistance to reconstruction attacks. Results show that GFT-GCN effectively balances privacy and performance, offering a practical solution for secure 3D face authentication.

TL;DR: MambaEye is a causal sequential visual encoder that uses Mamba2 backbone with unidirectional processing and relative move embeddings to achieve input-size agnostic vision, maintaining linear complexity while performing well across various resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a truly input-size agnostic visual encoder that mimics human vision's ability to process images of any size, overcoming limitations of previous vision encoders that lack this fundamental characteristic.

Method: Uses causal sequential encoder with Mamba2 backbone, strictly unidirectional processing, relative move embeddings for spatial shift encoding, and a diffusion-inspired loss function for step-wise supervision during training.

Result: Demonstrates robust performance across wide range of image resolutions, especially at high resolutions like 1536² on ImageNet-1K classification, while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to patch count.

Conclusion: MambaEye successfully achieves input-size agnostic visual encoding through causal sequential processing and relative move embeddings, enabling flexible adaptation to arbitrary image resolutions with efficient computational complexity.

Abstract: Despite decades of progress, a truly input-size agnostic visual encoder-a fundamental characteristic of human vision-has remained elusive. We address this limitation by proposing \textbf{MambaEye}, a novel, causal sequential encoder that leverages the low complexity and causal-process based pure Mamba2 backbone. Unlike previous Mamba-based vision encoders that often employ bidirectional processing, our strictly unidirectional approach preserves the inherent causality of State Space Models, enabling the model to generate a prediction at any point in its input sequence. A core innovation is our use of relative move embedding, which encodes the spatial shift between consecutive patches, providing a strong inductive bias for translation invariance and making the model inherently adaptable to arbitrary image resolutions and scanning patterns. To achieve this, we introduce a novel diffusion-inspired loss function that provides dense, step-wise supervision, training the model to build confidence as it gathers more visual evidence. We demonstrate that MambaEye exhibits robust performance across a wide range of image resolutions, especially at higher resolutions such as $1536^2$ on the ImageNet-1K classification task. This feat is achieved while maintaining linear time and memory complexity relative to the number of patches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion models struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, leading to concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality.

Method: Uses LLM to decompose prompts into semantic units, iterative synthesis with visual context, RL with Decaying Stochasticity Schedule, and hierarchical rewards at global, subject, and relationship levels.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing methods in concept coverage and compositional accuracy on the HiCoPrompt benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed HiCoGen framework effectively addresses compositional challenges in text-to-image generation through hierarchical decomposition and optimized RL training.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability in generating high-quality images for simple prompts. However, when confronted with complex prompts involving multiple objects and hierarchical structures, existing models struggle to accurately follow instructions, leading to issues such as concept omission, confusion, and poor compositionality. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Compositional Generative framework (HiCoGen) built upon a novel Chain of Synthesis (CoS) paradigm. Instead of monolithic generation, HiCoGen first leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose complex prompts into minimal semantic units. It then synthesizes these units iteratively, where the image generated in each step provides crucial visual context for the next, ensuring all textual concepts are faithfully constructed into the final scene. To further optimize this process, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework. Crucially, we identify that the limited exploration of standard diffusion samplers hinders effective RL. We theoretically prove that sample diversity is maximized by concentrating stochasticity in the early generation stages and, based on this insight, propose a novel Decaying Stochasticity Schedule to enhance exploration. Our RL algorithm is then guided by a hierarchical reward mechanism that jointly evaluates the image at the global, subject, and relationship levels. We also construct HiCoPrompt, a new text-to-image benchmark with hierarchical prompts for rigorous evaluation. Experiments show our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both concept coverage and compositional accuracy.

TL;DR: VGGT4D extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction without training, using implicit dynamic cues from attention layers to separate static and dynamic elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 4D reconstruction methods struggle with moving objects, require external priors or heavy optimization, and need fine-tuning on 4D datasets. VGGT4D aims to overcome these limitations by leveraging VGGT's capabilities without additional training.

Method: Mines dynamic cues from VGGT's global attention layers using gram similarity, aggregates them temporally, refines mask boundaries with projection gradient, and integrates masks into early-stage inference to reduce motion interference.

Result: Achieves superior performance across six datasets in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. Supports single-pass inference on sequences over 500 frames.

Conclusion: VGGT4D provides an effective training-free framework for robust 4D scene reconstruction by exploiting implicit dynamic information already present in 3D foundation models.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 4D scenes is challenging, as it requires robust disentanglement of dynamic objects from the static background. While 3D foundation models like VGGT provide accurate 3D geometry, their performance drops markedly when moving objects dominate. Existing 4D approaches often rely on external priors, heavy post-optimization, or require fine-tuning on 4D datasets. In this paper, we propose VGGT4D, a training-free framework that extends the 3D foundation model VGGT for robust 4D scene reconstruction. Our approach is motivated by the key finding that VGGT's global attention layers already implicitly encode rich, layer-wise dynamic cues. To obtain masks that decouple static and dynamic elements, we mine and amplify global dynamic cues via gram similarity and aggregate them across a temporal window. To further sharpen mask boundaries, we introduce a refinement strategy driven by projection gradient. We then integrate these precise masks into VGGT's early-stage inference, effectively mitigating motion interference in both pose estimation and geometric reconstruction. Across six datasets, our method achieves superior performance in dynamic object segmentation, camera pose estimation, and dense reconstruction. It also supports single-pass inference on sequences longer than 500 frames.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind RLVR's effectiveness in improving reasoning in LMMs and leverage this understanding to develop training-free enhancement methods.

Method: Proposed Activation Replay - a training-free approach that replays low-entropy activations from base LMMs to regulate RLVR counterparts by manipulating visual tokens at test time.

Result: Activation Replay improves reasoning across mathematics, visual agents, and video reasoning, boosts Pass@K, and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR.

Conclusion: Modulating low-entropy activations is beneficial for LMM reasoning, and Activation Replay provides an effective training-free method to enhance multimodal reasoning in post-trained LMMs.

Abstract: Recently, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an effective approach to incentivizing reasoning capability in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), while the underlying mechanisms behind this post-training paradigm are poorly understood. We begin by exploring how input activations are affected by RLVR through the perspective of logit lens. Our systematic investigations across multiple post-trained LMMs suggest that RLVR shifts low-entropy activations unexpectedly, while high-entropy ones are less affected. We further demonstrate that such phenomena are associated with LMM reasoning by controlled experiments, suggesting a potentially beneficial role of modulating low-entropy activations. To this end, we propose Activation Replay, a novel simple yet effective training-free approach that boosts multimodal reasoning of post-trained LMMs without requiring expensive policy optimization. Our design involves manipulation of visual tokens at test time, replaying low-entropy activations from the input context of base LMMs to regulating the RLVR counterparts. Activation Replay triggers better reasoning across diverse scenarios, including mathematics, o3-like visual agents, and video reasoning. We further show that Activation Replay boosts Pass@K and mitigates narrower reasoning coverage of RLVR. Our design is compared against alternative choices, such as replaying high-entropy activations instead of low-entropy ones, or direct cross-model intervention instead of manipulating input tokens, demonstrating the superiority of our implementation. Codes will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing C-EIGC approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images and fail to adaptively adjust emotional prompts based on image content, limiting emotional continuity and fidelity.

Method: Proposes EmoFeedback2 with emotion-aware reward feedback (LVLM evaluates emotional values and computes rewards) and self-promotion textual feedback (LVLM analyzes emotional content and produces refinement suggestions for prompts).

Result: Extensive experiments show the approach effectively generates high-quality images with desired emotions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on custom dataset.

Conclusion: The proposed EmoFeedback2 paradigm successfully addresses emotional continuity and fidelity issues in continuous emotional image generation through reinforcement learning with LVLM feedback.

Abstract: Continuous emotional image generation (C-EICG) is emerging rapidly due to its ability to produce images aligned with both user descriptions and continuous emotional values. However, existing approaches lack emotional feedback from generated images, limiting the control of emotional continuity. Additionally, their simple alignment between emotions and naively generated texts fails to adaptively adjust emotional prompts according to image content, leading to insufficient emotional fidelity. To address these concerns, we propose a novel generation-understanding-feedback reinforcement paradigm (EmoFeedback2) for C-EICG, which exploits the reasoning capability of the fine-tuned large vision-language model (LVLM) to provide reward and textual feedback for generating high-quality images with continuous emotions. Specifically, we introduce an emotion-aware reward feedback strategy, where the LVLM evaluates the emotional values of generated images and computes the reward against target emotions, guiding the reinforcement fine-tuning of the generative model and enhancing the emotional continuity of images. Furthermore, we design a self-promotion textual feedback framework, in which the LVLM iteratively analyzes the emotional content of generated images and adaptively produces refinement suggestions for the next-round prompt, improving the emotional fidelity with fine-grained content. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively generates high-quality images with the desired emotions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in our custom dataset. The code and dataset will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing guidance-based methods for using generic text-to-image models in inpainting are limited in practice, requiring specialized inpainting models despite theoretical capability.

Method: Optimize initial seed noise to match unmasked image parts using linear approximation to avoid costly unrolling and spectral domain optimization for stability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various inpainting tasks with as few as tens of optimization steps.

Conclusion: Optimizing initial seed noise is the missing ingredient for effective training-free inpainting with off-the-shelf text-to-image models.

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free method for inpainting with off-the-shelf text-to-image models. While guidance-based methods in theory allow generic models to be used for inverse problems such as inpainting, in practice, their effectiveness is limited, leading to the necessity of specialized inpainting-specific models. In this work, we argue that the missing ingredient for training-free inpainting is the optimization (guidance) of the initial seed noise. We propose to optimize the initial seed noise to approximately match the unmasked parts of the data - with as few as a few tens of optimization steps. We then apply conventional training-free inpainting methods on top of our optimized initial seed noise. Critically, we propose two core ideas to effectively implement this idea: (i) to avoid the costly unrolling required to relate the initial noise and the generated outcome, we perform linear approximation; and (ii) to stabilize the optimization, we optimize the initial seed noise in the spectral domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various inpainting tasks, outperforming the state of the art. Project page: https://ubc-vision.github.io/sonic/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Multimodal VR gaze prediction combining gaze history, head movement, and scene content using gated fusion with cross-modal attention, achieving 93.1% accuracy across 22 VR scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting gaze behavior in VR is challenging but important for rendering optimization and interface design, with potential to reduce reliance on expensive eye tracking hardware.

Method: Gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention that adaptively weights gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance, evaluated on 5.3M gaze samples across 22 VR scenes.

Result: Improved predictive accuracy when combining modalities vs individual streams, with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories across 1-3 future frames.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration enhances VR gaze prediction, contributing to understanding attention mechanisms and enabling more efficient VR systems for rendering optimization and user experience evaluation.

Abstract: Predicting gaze behavior in virtual reality environments remains a significant challenge with implications for rendering optimization and interface design. This paper introduces a multimodal approach to VR gaze prediction that combines temporal gaze patterns, head movement data, and visual scene information. By leveraging a gated fusion mechanism with cross-modal attention, the approach learns to adaptively weight gaze history, head movement, and scene content based on contextual relevance. Evaluations using a dataset spanning 22 VR scenes with 5.3M gaze samples demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy when combining modalities compared to using individual data streams alone. The results indicate that integrating past gaze trajectories with head orientation and scene content enhances prediction accuracy across 1-3 future frames. Cross-scene generalization testing shows consistent performance with 93.1% validation accuracy and temporal consistency in predicted gaze trajectories. These findings contribute to understanding attention mechanisms in virtual environments while suggesting potential applications in rendering optimization, interaction design, and user experience evaluation. The approach represents a step toward more efficient virtual reality systems that can anticipate user attention patterns without requiring expensive eye tracking hardware.

*Yaoli Liu,Ziheng Ouyang,Shengtao Lou,Yiren Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A detail-aware refinement framework that performs two-stage reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency in image generation, addressing limitations of current diffusion models in preserving fine-grained visual details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to preserve fine-grained visual details when refining images using references due to VAE-based latent compression discarding subtle texture information, and existing post-editing approaches often produce inconsistent results in lighting, texture, or shape.

Method: Two consecutive stages: 1) Adapt a single-image diffusion editor fine-tuned to jointly process draft and reference images for globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity; 2) Apply reinforcement learning to strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency.

Result: Significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively addresses the limitations of current diffusion models in preserving fine-grained details during reference-guided image generation, achieving superior performance in detail preservation and visual coherence.

Abstract: Reference-guided image generation has progressed rapidly, yet current diffusion models still struggle to preserve fine-grained visual details when refining a generated image using a reference. This limitation arises because VAE-based latent compression inherently discards subtle texture information, causing identity- and attribute-specific cues to vanish. Moreover, post-editing approaches that amplify local details based on existing methods often produce results inconsistent with the original image in terms of lighting, texture, or shape. To address this, we introduce \ourMthd{}, a detail-aware refinement framework that performs two consecutive stages of reference-driven correction to enhance pixel-level consistency. We first adapt a single-image diffusion editor by fine-tuning it to jointly ingest the draft image and the reference image, enabling globally coherent refinement while maintaining structural fidelity. We then apply reinforcement learning to further strengthen localized editing capability, explicitly optimizing for detail accuracy and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \ourMthd{} significantly improves reference alignment and fine-grained detail preservation, producing faithful and visually coherent edits that surpass both open-source and commercial models on challenging reference-guided restoration benchmarks.

*Jiyeon Han,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri,Hao Zhang,Haedong Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces CREward, the first type-specific creativity reward model that evaluates creativity across geometry, material, and texture dimensions, using human benchmarks and LVLM-generated labels for training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creativity is complex and treating it as a single quantity is insufficient. The work aims to provide a more nuanced understanding by breaking down creativity into specific types aligned with the image formation pipeline.

Method: Conducted human benchmark evaluation to capture creativity perception, analyzed LVLM-human alignment, collected LVLM-generated labels to train CREward model, and explored applications in assessment, explanation, and generation.

Result: LVLMs show strong alignment with human perception of creativity. CREward model successfully enables type-specific creativity evaluation and generation across geometry, material, and texture dimensions.

Conclusion: CREward provides a novel framework for type-specific creativity modeling that bridges human perception and computational assessment, with practical applications in creativity evaluation, explanation, and generation.

Abstract: Creativity is a complex phenomenon. When it comes to representing and assessing creativity, treating it as a single undifferentiated quantity would appear naive and underwhelming. In this work, we learn the \emph{first type-specific creativity reward model}, coined CREward, which spans three creativity ``axes," geometry, material, and texture, to allow us to view creativity through the lens of the image formation pipeline. To build our reward model, we first conduct a human benchmark evaluation to capture human perception of creativity for each type across various creative images. We then analyze the correlation between human judgments and predictions by large vision-language models (LVLMs), confirming that LVLMs exhibit strong alignment with human perception. Building on this observation, we collect LVLM-generated labels to train our CREward model that is applicable to both evaluation and generation of creative images. We explore three applications of CREward: creativity assessment, explainable creativity, and creative sample acquisition for both human design inspiration and guiding creative generation through low-rank adaptation.

*Changyue Li,Jiaying Li,Youliang Yuan,Jiaming He,Zhicong Huang,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs) that can hijack entire decision chains in neural networks, causing cascading errors with a single perturbation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world models operate in sequences of decisions where isolated mistakes are easily corrected, but cascading errors pose severe risks. The paper aims to expose this threat where a single perturbation can manipulate multiple predefined outcomes simultaneously.

Method: Developed SAUPs that induce varied outcomes based on input semantics, using an algorithm that searches for perturbations in normalized space with semantic separation strategy. Evaluated on RIST dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations.

Result: Achieved 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just one adversarial frame across three multimodal large language models.

Conclusion: Multimodal large language models are vulnerable to SAUP attacks, demonstrating the practical threat of cascading errors in sequential decision-making systems.

Abstract: Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.
  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying "non-motorized lane" signs as "motorized lane" and "pedestrian" as "plastic bag".
  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.

*Yuanzhe Li,Steffen Müller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal fusion network using 7 modality features from visual and motion branches for pedestrian crossing intention prediction, achieving superior performance on JAAD dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicle safety but challenging due to diverse pedestrian behavior and contextual dependencies.

Method: Uses Transformer-based feature extraction, depth-guided attention for spatial feature interactions, and modality/temporal attention mechanisms to selectively emphasize important features.

Result: Extensive experiments on JAAD dataset show superior performance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The proposed multimodal fusion network effectively extracts and integrates complementary cues across different modalities for improved pedestrian crossing intention prediction.

Abstract: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for the deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban environments. Ideal prediction provides AVs with critical environmental cues, thereby reducing the risk of pedestrian-related collisions. However, the prediction task is challenging due to the diverse nature of pedestrian behavior and its dependence on multiple contextual factors. This paper proposes a multimodal fusion network that leverages seven modality features from both visual and motion branches, aiming to effectively extract and integrate complementary cues across different modalities. Specifically, motion and visual features are extracted from the raw inputs using multiple Transformer-based extraction modules. Depth-guided attention module leverages depth information to guide attention towards salient regions in another modality through comprehensive spatial feature interactions. To account for the varying importance of different modalities and frames, modality attention and temporal attention are designed to selectively emphasize informative modalities and effectively capture temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on the JAAD dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, achieving superior performance compared to the baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicle safety but remains challenging due to multiple factors affecting pedestrian behavior in urban environments.

Method: Uses multi-context fusion Transformer with progressive fusion strategy: mutual intra-context attention, mutual cross-context attention, guided intra-context attention, and guided cross-context attention to integrate features across four contextual dimensions.

Result: Achieves accuracy rates of 73% on JAADbeh, 93% on JAADall, and 90% on PIE datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MFT effectively integrates diverse contextual information for pedestrian intention prediction, validated through superior performance and extensive ablation studies.

Abstract: Pedestrian crossing intention prediction is essential for autonomous vehicles to improve pedestrian safety and reduce traffic accidents. However, accurate pedestrian intention prediction in urban environments remains challenging due to the multitude of factors affecting pedestrian behavior. In this paper, we propose a multi-context fusion Transformer (MFT) that leverages diverse numerical contextual attributes across four key dimensions, encompassing pedestrian behavior context, environmental context, pedestrian localization context and vehicle motion context, to enable accurate pedestrian intention prediction. MFT employs a progressive fusion strategy, where mutual intra-context attention enables reciprocal interactions within each context, thereby facilitating feature sequence fusion and yielding a context token as a context-specific representation. This is followed by mutual cross-context attention, which integrates features across contexts with a global CLS token serving as a compact multi-context representation. Finally, guided intra-context attention refines context tokens within each context through directed interactions, while guided cross-context attention strengthens the global CLS token to promote multi-context fusion via guided information propagation, yielding deeper and more efficient integration. Experimental results validate the superiority of MFT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 73%, 93%, and 90% on the JAADbeh, JAADall, and PIE datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the network architecture and contribution of different input context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains a major challenge in pedestrian crossing intention prediction for autonomous vehicles.

Method: Uses attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer with six modalities grouped into three interaction pairs, employing dual-path attention, optical flow-guided attention, and cross-modal attention mechanisms, plus temporal feature aggregation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 70% accuracy on JAADbeh and 89% on JAADall datasets.

Conclusion: ACIT effectively integrates multi-modal data through attention mechanisms and temporal modeling, demonstrating superior performance in pedestrian crossing intention prediction.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing intention is crucial for autonomous vehicles to prevent pedestrian-related collisions. However, effectively extracting and integrating complementary cues from different types of data remains one of the major challenges. This paper proposes an attention-guided cross-modal interaction Transformer (ACIT) for pedestrian crossing intention prediction. ACIT leverages six visual and motion modalities, which are grouped into three interaction pairs: (1) Global semantic map and global optical flow, (2) Local RGB image and local optical flow, and (3) Ego-vehicle speed and pedestrian's bounding box. Within each visual interaction pair, a dual-path attention mechanism enhances salient regions within the primary modality through intra-modal self-attention and facilitates deep interactions with the auxiliary modality (i.e., optical flow) via optical flow-guided attention. Within the motion interaction pair, cross-modal attention is employed to model the cross-modal dynamics, enabling the effective extraction of complementary motion features. Beyond pairwise interactions, a multi-modal feature fusion module further facilitates cross-modal interactions at each time step. Furthermore, a Transformer-based temporal feature aggregation module is introduced to capture sequential dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that ACIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy rates of 70% and 89% on the JAADbeh and JAADall datasets, respectively. Extensive ablation studies are further conducted to investigate the contribution of different modules of ACIT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task for autonomous driving that uses multi-view inputs to handle complex scenarios where avoiding one risk creates another, and presents WaymoQA dataset to improve MLLMs' reasoning in these safety-critical situations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal large language models struggle with high-level reasoning in safety-critical driving scenarios where avoiding one traffic risk can create another downstream risk, requiring comprehensive environmental understanding beyond single front-view inputs.

Method: Defined Safety-Critical Reasoning as a two-stage process: first resolve immediate risks, then mitigate decision-induced downstream risks. Created WaymoQA dataset with 35,000 human-annotated QA pairs covering complex high-risk scenarios in multiple-choice and open-ended formats across image and video modalities.

Result: Experiments showed existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improved their reasoning ability in these complex situations.

Conclusion: The WaymoQA dataset effectively enhances MLLMs' safety-critical reasoning capabilities, contributing to the development of safer and more reasoning-capable autonomous driving agents.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong understanding of driving scenes, drawing interest in their application to autonomous driving. However, high-level reasoning in safety-critical scenarios, where avoiding one traffic risk can create another, remains a major challenge. Such reasoning is often infeasible with only a single front view and requires a comprehensive view of the environment, which we achieve through multi-view inputs. We define Safety-Critical Reasoning as a new task that leverages multi-view inputs to address this challenge. Then, we distill Safety-Critical Reasoning into two stages: first resolve the immediate risk, then mitigate the decision-induced downstream risks. To support this, we introduce WaymoQA, a dataset of 35,000 human-annotated question-answer pairs covering complex, high-risk driving scenarios. The dataset includes multiple-choice and open-ended formats across both image and video modalities. Experiments reveal that existing MLLMs underperform in safety-critical scenarios compared to normal scenes, but fine-tuning with WaymoQA significantly improves their reasoning ability, highlighting the effectiveness of our dataset in developing safer and more reasoning-capable driving agents.

*Lin Chen,Yingjian Zhu,Qi Yang,Xin Niu,Kun Ding,Shiming Xiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-MI is a mask-injected framework that integrates SAM with OVSS models to address over-segmentation and hard mask-label combinations, achieving significant performance improvements and speedup.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome SAM's tendency to over-segment and the challenge of hard combinations between fixed masks and labels in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.

Method: Uses Text-guided Sparse Point Prompter for faster mask generation, Shallow Mask Aggregation to merge partial masks, and Decoupled Mask Injection to incorporate SAM masks at different frequency levels.

Result: Achieves 16.7% relative improvement in mIoU over Grounded-SAM on MESS benchmark with 1.6× speedup.

Conclusion: SAM-MI serves as an effective alternative methodology to equip OVSS models with SAM capabilities.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) aims to segment and recognize objects universally. Trained on extensive high-quality segmentation data, the segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable universal segmentation capabilities, offering valuable support for OVSS. Although previous methods have made progress in leveraging SAM for OVSS, there are still some challenges: (1) SAM's tendency to over-segment and (2) hard combinations between fixed masks and labels. This paper introduces a novel mask-injected framework, SAM-MI, which effectively integrates SAM with OVSS models to address these challenges. Initially, SAM-MI employs a Text-guided Sparse Point Prompter to sample sparse prompts for SAM instead of previous dense grid-like prompts, thus significantly accelerating the mask generation process. The framework then introduces Shallow Mask Aggregation (SMAgg) to merge partial masks to mitigate the SAM's over-segmentation issue. Finally, Decoupled Mask Injection (DMI) incorporates SAM-generated masks for guidance at low-frequency and high-frequency separately, rather than directly combining them with labels. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the superiority of SAM-MI. Notably, the proposed method achieves a 16.7% relative improvement in mIoU over Grounded-SAM on the MESS benchmark, along with a 1.6$\times$ speedup. We hope SAM-MI can serve as an alternative methodology to effectively equip the OVSS model with SAM.

*Jianfei Zhao,Feng Zhang,Xin Sun,Chong Feng,Zhixing Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Guided Attention (VGA) is a training-free method that uses visual token semantics to guide MLLMs' attention, reducing hallucinations by 4.36% latency overhead while maintaining compatibility with efficient attention implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs have limited localization capability in visual attention, leading to hallucinations despite accurately extracting visual semantics from tokens.

Method: VGA constructs precise visual grounding using visual token semantics and guides model focus to relevant regions. For image captioning, it dynamically refines guidance by suppressing already-described regions.

Result: VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance across diverse MLLMs and hallucination benchmarks with minimal latency impact.

Conclusion: Explicit visual guidance is crucial for enhancing MLLMs' visual understanding capabilities and reducing hallucinations.

Abstract: Visual attention serves as the primary mechanism through which MLLMs interpret visual information; however, its limited localization capability often leads to hallucinations. We observe that although MLLMs can accurately extract visual semantics from visual tokens, they fail to fully leverage this advantage during subsequent inference. To address this limitation, we propose Vision-Guided Attention (VGA), a training-free method that first constructs precise visual grounding by exploiting the semantic content of visual tokens, and then uses this grounding to guide the model's focus toward relevant visual regions. In image captioning, VGA further refines this guidance dynamically during generation by suppressing regions that have already been described. In VGA, each token undergoes only a single forward pass, introducing a negligible latency overhead of just 4.36\%. In addition, VGA is fully compatible with efficient attention implementations such as FlashAttention. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and multiple hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that VGA achieves state-of-the-art dehallucination performance. Further analysis confirms that explicit visual guidance plays a crucial role in enhancing the visual understanding capabilities of MLLMs.

Result: Experiments on various datasets show COVec achieves higher visual fidelity and significantly improved editability compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: COVec successfully addresses limitations of traditional vectorization by incorporating illumination awareness through the Clair-Obscur principle, enabling better representation of complex real-world images.

Abstract: Image vectorization aims to convert raster images into editable, scalable vector representations while preserving visual fidelity. Existing vectorization methods struggle to represent complex real-world images, often producing fragmented shapes at the cost of semantic conciseness. In this paper, we propose COVec, an illumination-aware vectorization framework inspired by the Clair-Obscur principle of light-shade contrast. COVec is the first to introduce intrinsic image decomposition in the vector domain, separating an image into albedo, shade, and light layers in a unified vector representation. A semantic-guided initialization and two-stage optimization refine these layers with differentiable rendering. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that COVec achieves higher visual fidelity and significantly improved editability compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-based methods for point cloud generation offer low training cost and simplicity but underperform compared to representation-based approaches, creating a need for improved point-based methods.

Method: Multi-scale generation with coarse-to-fine paradigm using structured downsampling/upsampling to preserve geometric structure and ensure smooth distributional transitions across resolutions.

Result: Achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges representation-based methods, with strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks.

Conclusion: MFM-Point substantially improves point-based generation quality and scalability while preserving simplicity and efficiency, bridging the performance gap with representation-based methods.

Abstract: In recent years, point cloud generation has gained significant attention in 3D generative modeling. Among existing approaches, point-based methods directly generate point clouds without relying on other representations such as latent features, meshes, or voxels. These methods offer low training cost and algorithmic simplicity, but often underperform compared to representation-based approaches. In this paper, we propose MFM-Point, a multi-scale Flow Matching framework for point cloud generation that substantially improves the scalability and performance of point-based methods while preserving their simplicity and efficiency. Our multi-scale generation algorithm adopts a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, enhancing generation quality and scalability without incurring additional training or inference overhead. A key challenge in developing such a multi-scale framework lies in preserving the geometric structure of unordered point clouds while ensuring smooth and consistent distributional transitions across resolutions. To address this, we introduce a structured downsampling and upsampling strategy that preserves geometry and maintains alignment between coarse and fine resolutions. Our experimental results demonstrate that MFM-Point achieves best-in-class performance among point-based methods and challenges the best representation-based methods. In particular, MFM-point demonstrates strong results in multi-category and high-resolution generation tasks.

Conclusion: The framework provides an effective unsupervised approach for blind super-resolution in planetary applications without requiring ground-truth images or external kernel priors.

Abstract: Planetary remote sensing images are affected by diverse and unknown degradations caused by imaging environments and hardware constraints. These factors limit image quality and hinder supervised blind super-resolution due to the lack of ground-truth images. This work presents History-Augmented Contrastive Blind Super-Resolution (HACBSR), an unsupervised framework for blind super-resolution that operates without ground-truth images and external kernel priors. HACBSR comprises two components: (1) a contrastive kernel sampling mechanism with kernel similarity control to mitigate distribution bias from Gaussian sampling, and (2) a history-augmented contrastive learning that uses historical models to generate negative samples to enable less greedy optimization and to induce strong convexity without ground-truth. A convergence analysis of the history-augmented contrastive learning is given in the Appendix. To support evaluation in planetary applications, we introduce Ceres-50, a dataset with diverse geological features simulated degradation patterns. Experiments show that HACBSR achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art unsupervised methods across multiple upscaling factors.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance degradation in endoscopic depth estimation due to uneven illumination, especially in low-intensity regions. Existing enhancement techniques fail to guide depth networks effectively, and solutions from other fields require well-lit images.

Method: Proposes DeLight-Mono with illumination-reflectance-depth model to decompose endoscopic images using auxiliary networks. Uses self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses leveraging decoupled components.

Result: Effectiveness verified through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on two public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully mitigates the effects of uneven illumination on depth estimation in endoscopic navigation systems.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation serves as a key task in the development of endoscopic navigation systems. However, performance degradation persists due to uneven illumination inherent in endoscopic images, particularly in low-intensity regions. Existing low-light enhancement techniques fail to effectively guide the depth network. Furthermore, solutions from other fields, like autonomous driving, require well-lit images, making them unsuitable and increasing data collection burdens. To this end, we present DeLight-Mono - a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework with illumination decoupling. Specifically, endoscopic images are represented by a designed illumination-reflectance-depth model, and are decomposed with auxiliary networks. Moreover, a self-supervised joint-optimizing framework with novel losses leveraging the decoupled components is proposed to mitigate the effects of uneven illumination on depth estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was rigorously verified through extensive comparisons and an ablation study performed on two public datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality in point cloud compression is challenging because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution, requiring specialized handling.

Method: Converts voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity and computational cost, uses frequency-disentangling to extract low-frequency content and collect high-frequency details across scales, stores components in binary format, and recovers full-spectrum signals via modulation with frequency-based attention.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, outperforming standard codecs by 78% and 94% in BD-rate on SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets respectively.

Conclusion: FLaTEC effectively addresses the frequency imbalance in point cloud compression through frequency-aware mechanisms and triplane representations, delivering superior compression performance.

Abstract: Point cloud compression methods jointly optimize bitrates and reconstruction distortion. However, balancing compression ratio and reconstruction quality is difficult because low-frequency and high-frequency components contribute differently at the same resolution. To address this, we propose FLaTEC, a frequency-aware compression model that enables the compression of a full scan with high compression ratios. Our approach introduces a frequency-aware mechanism that decouples low-frequency structures and high-frequency textures, while hybridizing latent triplanes as a compact proxy for point cloud. Specifically, we convert voxelized embeddings into triplane representations to reduce sparsity, computational cost, and storage requirements. We then devise a frequency-disentangling technique that extracts compact low-frequency content while collecting high-frequency details across scales. The decoupled low-frequency and high-frequency components are stored in binary format. During decoding, full-spectrum signals are progressively recovered via a modulation block. Additionally, to compensate for the loss of 3D correlation, we introduce an efficient frequency-based attention mechanism that fosters local connectivity and outputs arbitrary resolution points. Our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and outperforms the standard codecs by 78\% and 94\% in BD-rate on both SemanticKITTI and Ford datasets.

TL;DR: PRADA is a probability-ratio-based method that detects and attributes images generated by autoregressive models by analyzing the ratio between conditional and unconditional probabilities of token sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generators can create highly realistic images, increasing the need for reliable detection methods, but there's a lack of work specifically targeting detection of AR-generated images.

Method: Analyzes the ratio between a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence of an image, using unique characteristics in probability ratios for threshold-based detection and attribution.

Result: Highly effective against eight class-to-image and four text-to-image autoregressive models, showing reliable detection and attribution capabilities.

Conclusion: PRADA provides a simple and interpretable approach for detecting and attributing autoregressive-generated images by exploiting unique probability ratio characteristics.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image synthesis. Leveraging the generation principle of large language models, they allow for efficiently generating deceptively real-looking images, further increasing the need for reliable detection methods. However, to date there is a lack of work specifically targeting the detection of images generated by AR image generators. In this work, we present PRADA (Probability-Ratio-Based Attribution and Detection of Autoregressive-Generated Images), a simple and interpretable approach that can reliably detect AR-generated images and attribute them to their respective source model. The key idea is to inspect the ratio of a model's conditional and unconditional probability for the autoregressive token sequence representing a given image. Whenever an image is generated by a particular model, its probability ratio shows unique characteristics which are not present for images generated by other models or real images. We exploit these characteristics for threshold-based attribution and detection by calibrating a simple, model-specific score function. Our experimental evaluation shows that PRADA is highly effective against eight class-to-image and four text-to-image models.

### [131] [Learning Procedural-aware Video Representations through State-Grounded Hierarchy Unfolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20073)
*Jinghan Zhao,Yifei Huang,Feng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a Task-Step-State (TSS) framework that uses textual 'states' as a visually-grounded semantic layer to better align procedural semantics with video representations, outperforming existing methods on multiple video understanding tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods align video content with abstract 'task' and 'step' descriptions, but these high-level abstractions fail to form robust alignment with concrete visual details, limiting procedural understanding.

Method: Proposes TSS framework where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states, with progressive pre-training that unfolds the TSS hierarchy to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and tasks.

Result: Outperforms baseline models on COIN and CrossTask datasets for task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. State supervision is identified as key performance driver across all tasks.

Conclusion: The TSS framework with state-level grounding and progressive pre-training effectively bridges the gap between abstract procedural semantics and concrete visual observations, enabling better procedural-aware video representations.

Abstract: Learning procedural-aware video representations is a key step towards building agents that can reason about and execute complex tasks. Existing methods typically address this problem by aligning visual content with textual descriptions at the task and step levels to inject procedural semantics into video representations. However, due to their high level of abstraction, 'task' and 'step' descriptions fail to form a robust alignment with the concrete, observable details in visual data. To address this, we introduce 'states', i.e., textual snapshots of object configurations, as a visually-grounded semantic layer that anchors abstract procedures to what a model can actually see. We formalize this insight in a novel Task-Step-State (TSS) framework, where tasks are achieved via steps that drive transitions between observable states. To enforce this structure, we propose a progressive pre-training strategy that unfolds the TSS hierarchy, forcing the model to ground representations in states while associating them with steps and high-level tasks. Extensive experiments on the COIN and CrossTask datasets show that our method outperforms baseline models on multiple downstream tasks, including task recognition, step recognition, and next step prediction. Ablation studies show that introducing state supervision is a key driver of performance gains across all tasks. Additionally, our progressive pretraining strategy proves more effective than standard joint training, as it better enforces the intended hierarchical structure.

### [132] [Blind Adaptive Local Denoising for CEST Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20081)
*Chu Chen,Aitor Artola,Yang Liu,Se Weon Park,Raymond H. Chan,Jean-Michel Morel,Kannie W. Y. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BALD, a blind adaptive local denoising method for CEST MRI that addresses spatially varying noise and heteroscedasticity without prior noise knowledge, improving quantitative contrast mapping accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical translation of CEST MRI is hindered by spatially varying noise from hardware limitations and complex protocols causing heteroscedasticity, which traditional denoising methods cannot handle without altering critical biomedical information.

Method: BALD exploits CEST data self-similarity to create adaptive variance-stabilizing transform, then performs two-stage denoising on linear-transformed data using local SVD decomposition to separate molecular signals from noise.

Result: Extensive validation on phantoms and in vivo scans showed BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in denoising metrics and downstream tasks like molecular concentration mapping and cancer detection.

Conclusion: BALD effectively addresses CEST MRI noise challenges without prior noise knowledge, enabling more accurate quantitative contrast mapping and improving clinical applications.

Abstract: Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI enables molecular-level visualization of low-concentration metabolites by leveraging proton exchange dynamics. However, its clinical translation is hindered by inherent challenges: spatially varying noise arising from hardware limitations, and complex imaging protocols introduce heteroscedasticity in CEST data, perturbing the accuracy of quantitative contrast mapping such as amide proton transfer (APT) imaging. Traditional denoising methods are not designed for this complex noise and often alter the underlying information that is critical for biomedical analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new Blind Adaptive Local Denoising (BALD) method. BALD exploits the self-similar nature of CEST data to derive an adaptive variance-stabilizing transform that equalizes the noise distributions across CEST pixels without prior knowledge of noise characteristics. Then, BALD performs two-stage denoising on a linear transformation of data to disentangle molecular signals from noise. A local SVD decomposition is used as a linear transform to prevent spatial and spectral denoising artifacts. We conducted extensive validation experiments on multiple phantoms and \textit{in vivo} CEST scans. In these experiments, BALD consistently outperformed state-of-the-art CEST denoisers in both denoising metrics and downstream tasks such as molecular concentration maps estimation and cancer detection.

*Arianna Stropeni,Valentina Zaccaria,Francesco Borsatti,Davide Dalle Pezze,Manuel Barusco,Gian Antonio Susto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CONVAD, a concept-aware visual anomaly detection method that extends Concept Bottleneck Models to provide human-interpretable concept-based explanations alongside visual anomaly localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VAD models provide visual explanations but lack semantically meaningful interpretations for users, limiting their practical utility and trustworthiness.

Method: Extends Concept Bottleneck Models to VAD by: (i) creating a Concept Dataset, (ii) improving CBM architecture for both concept-based and visual explanations, and (iii) developing an anomaly synthesis pipeline to minimize dependence on rare anomalous samples.

Result: CONVAD achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability.

Conclusion: The approach successfully bridges semantic and localization interpretability, offering more insightful anomaly explanations and enhancing trust in VAD systems.

Abstract: In recent years, Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) has gained significant attention due to its ability to identify anomalous images using only normal images during training. Many VAD models work without supervision but are still able to provide visual explanations by highlighting the anomalous regions within an image. However, although these visual explanations can be helpful, they lack a direct and semantically meaningful interpretation for users. To address this limitation, we propose extending Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to the VAD setting. By learning meaningful concepts, the network can provide human-interpretable descriptions of anomalies, offering a novel and more insightful way to explain them. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we develop a Concept Dataset to support research on CBMs for VAD; (ii) we improve the CBM architecture to generate both concept-based and visual explanations, bridging semantic and localization interpretability; and (iii) we introduce a pipeline for synthesizing artificial anomalies, preserving the VAD paradigm of minimizing dependence on rare anomalous samples. Our approach, Concept-Aware Visual Anomaly Detection (CONVAD), achieves performance comparable to classic VAD methods while providing richer, concept-driven explanations that enhance interpretability and trust in VAD systems.

TL;DR: WPT is a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that uses online distillation guided by an end-to-end world model to create lightweight policies with improved planning performance and real-time deployability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing world model approaches suffer from tight runtime coupling or dependency on offline reward signals, causing substantial inference overhead and hindering end-to-end optimization.

Method: Developed a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning trajectories with predicted future dynamics, then used policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer reasoning ability to a lightweight student policy.

Result: Achieved state-of-the-art performance with 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and 79.23 driving score (closed-loop), surpassing world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety, with 4.9x faster inference.

Conclusion: WPT enables efficient world-to-policy transfer that enhances planning performance while maintaining real-time deployability through effective distillation techniques.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in world models, which primarily aim to capture the spatio-temporal correlations between an agent's actions and the evolving environment. However, existing approaches often suffer from tight runtime coupling or depend on offline reward signals, resulting in substantial inference overhead or hindering end-to-end optimization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce WPT, a World-to-Policy Transfer training paradigm that enables online distillation under the guidance of an end-to-end world model. Specifically, we develop a trainable reward model that infuses world knowledge into a teacher policy by aligning candidate trajectories with the future dynamics predicted by the world model. Subsequently, we propose policy distillation and world reward distillation to transfer the teacher's reasoning ability into a lightweight student policy, enhancing planning performance while preserving real-time deployability. Extensive experiments on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks show that our WPT achieves state-of-the-art performance with a simple policy architecture: it attains a 0.11 collision rate (open-loop) and achieves a 79.23 driving score (closed-loop) surpassing both world-model-based and imitation-learning methods in accuracy and safety. Moreover, the student sustains up to 4.9x faster inference, while retaining most of the gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses lack of datasets and models for early forest fire detection, as existing methods miss early-stage fires due to insufficient training data.

Method: Created synthetic dataset using Red Dead Redemption 2 game simulator for smoke plumes and early fire instances, combined with existing images. Evaluated YOLOv7 and detection transformer models.

Result: Developed a comprehensive dataset for early fire detection and compared performance of different object detection models on this dataset.

Conclusion: Synthetic data generation from game engines provides viable solution for early forest fire detection dataset creation, enabling better model training and performance evaluation.

Abstract: There have been many recent developments in the use of Deep Learning Neural Networks for fire detection. In this paper, we explore an early warning system for detection of forest fires. Due to the lack of sizeable datasets and models tuned for this task, existing methods suffer from missed detection. In this work, we first propose a dataset for early identification of forest fires through visual analysis. Unlike existing image corpuses that contain images of wide-spread fire, our dataset consists of multiple instances of smoke plumes and fire that indicates the initiation of fire. We obtained this dataset synthetically by utilising game simulators such as Red Dead Redemption 2. We also combined our dataset with already published images to obtain a more comprehensive set. Finally, we compared image classification and localisation methods on the proposed dataset. More specifically we used YOLOv7 (You Only Look Once) and different models of detection transformer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revolutionize healthcare by developing automated systems for detecting structural abnormalities like cardiomegaly using advanced imaging technologies and deep learning approaches.

Method: Integrated approach using CNN with Inception V3 model combined with multi-head attention mechanisms. Process includes data collection, preprocessing, and attention mechanisms that selectively focus on relevant regions in X-ray images.

Result: The model achieved excellent performance: accuracy 95.6%, precision 95.2%, recall 96.2%, sensitivity 95.7%, specificity 96.1%, and AUC 96.0%.

Conclusion: The proposed system successfully demonstrates clinical significance in cardiomegaly detection through deep learning and attention mechanisms, providing accurate and reliable automated diagnosis from X-ray images.

Abstract: The healthcare industry has been revolutionized significantly by novel imaging technologies, not just in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases but also by the visualization of structural abnormalities like cardiomegaly. This article explains an integrated approach to the use of deep learning tools and attention mechanisms for automatic detection of cardiomegaly using X-ray images. The initiation of the project is grounded on a strong Data Collection phase and gathering the data of annotated X-ray images of various types. Then, while the Preprocessing module fine-tunes image quality, it is feasible to utilize the best out of the data quality in the proposed system. In our proposed system, the process is a CNN configuration leveraging the inception V3 model as one of the key blocks. Besides, we also employ a multilayer attention mechanism to enhance the strength. The most important feature of the method is the multi-head attention mechanism that can learn features automatically. By exact selective focusing on only some regions of input, the model can thus identify cardiomegaly in a sensitive manner. Attention rating is calculated, duplicated, and applied to enhance representation of main data, and therefore there is a successful diagnosis. The Evaluation stage will be extremely strict and it will thoroughly evaluate the model based on such measures as accuracy and precision. This will validate that the model can identify cardiomegaly and will also show the clinical significance of this method. The model has accuracy of 95.6, precision of 95.2, recall of 96.2, sensitivity of 95.7, specificity of 96.1 and an Area Under Curve(AUC) of 96.0 and their respective graphs are plotted for visualisation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalable lung cancer risk estimation is crucial for population-wide CT screening programs, but existing methods either require extensive annotations or analyze lungs in fragments, limiting performance and scalability.

Method: A fully transformer-based framework that processes whole-lung inputs, learns from large-scale screening data without region supervision, and includes optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss for anatomically focused attention.

Abstract: Lung cancer risk estimation is gaining increasing importance as more countries introduce population-wide screening programs using low-dose CT (LDCT). As imaging volumes grow, scalable methods that can process entire lung volumes efficiently are essential to tap into the full potential of these large screening datasets.

The model operates on whole-lung inputs, learning directly from large-scale screening data to capture comprehensive anatomical and pathological cues relevant for malignancy risk. Using only imaging data and no region supervision, LungEvaty matches state-of-the-art performance, refinable by an optional Anatomically Informed Attention Guidance (AIAG) loss that encourages anatomically focused attention. In total, LungEvaty was trained on more than 90,000 CT scans, including over 28,000 for fine-tuning and 6,000 for evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraViCo addresses video length extrapolation in diffusion transformers by suppressing attention dispersion for tokens beyond training windows, enabling 4x extrapolation without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion transformers struggle with length extrapolation due to periodic content repetition and quality degradation caused by attention dispersion beyond training windows.

Method: Proposes UltraViCo - a training-free method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond training window using constant decay factor to address attention dispersion.

Result: Outperforms baselines across models and extrapolation ratios, achieving 4x extrapolation (vs previous 2x), with 233% and 40.5% improvements in Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality.

Conclusion: UltraViCo effectively addresses both failure modes of video length extrapolation and generalizes to downstream tasks like controllable video synthesis and editing.

Abstract: Despite advances, video diffusion transformers still struggle to generalize beyond their training length, a challenge we term video length extrapolation. We identify two failure modes: model-specific periodic content repetition and a universal quality degradation. Prior works attempt to solve repetition via positional encodings, overlooking quality degradation and achieving only limited extrapolation. In this paper, we revisit this challenge from a more fundamental view: attention maps, which directly govern how context influences outputs. We identify that both failure modes arise from a unified cause: attention dispersion, where tokens beyond the training window dilute learned attention patterns. This leads to quality degradation and repetition emerges as a special case when this dispersion becomes structured into periodic attention patterns, induced by harmonic properties of positional encodings. Building on this insight, we propose UltraViCo, a training-free, plug-and-play method that suppresses attention for tokens beyond the training window via a constant decay factor. By jointly addressing both failure modes, we outperform a broad set of baselines largely across models and extrapolation ratios, pushing the extrapolation limit from 2x to 4x. Remarkably, it improves Dynamic Degree and Imaging Quality by 233% and 40.5% over the previous best method at 4x extrapolation. Furthermore, our method generalizes seamlessly to downstream tasks such as controllable video synthesis and editing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid expansion of PET/CT scanners has outpaced specialist availability, making automated report generation crucial for reducing clinical workload.

Method: Proposed PETRG-3D: end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes, incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital reporting variability. Constructed PETRG-Lym dataset (824 reports from 4 hospitals) and AutoPET-RG-Lym benchmark with expert-written reports.

Conclusion: This work establishes foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation. Codes, models, and AutoPET-RG-Lym benchmark will be publicly released.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is essential in oncology, yet the rapid expansion of scanners has outpaced the availability of trained specialists, making automated PET/CT report generation (PETRG) increasingly important for reducing clinical workload. Compared with structural imaging (e.g., X-ray, CT, and MRI), functional PET poses distinct challenges: metabolic patterns vary with tracer physiology, and whole-body 3D contextual information is required rather than local-region interpretation. To advance PETRG, we propose PETRG-3D, an end-to-end 3D dual-branch framework that separately encodes PET and CT volumes and incorporates style-adaptive prompts to mitigate inter-hospital variability in reporting practices. We construct PETRG-Lym, a multi-center lymphoma dataset collected from four hospitals (824 reports w/ 245,509 paired PET/CT slices), and construct AutoPET-RG-Lym, a publicly accessible PETRG benchmark derived from open imaging data but equipped with new expert-written, clinically validated reports (135 cases). To assess clinical utility, we introduce PETRG-Score, a lymphoma-specific evaluation protocol that jointly measures metabolic and structural findings across curated anatomical regions. Experiments show that PETRG-3D substantially outperforms existing methods on both natural language metrics (e.g., +31.49\% ROUGE-L) and clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., +8.18\% PET-All), highlighting the benefits of volumetric dual-modality modeling and style-aware prompting. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for future PET/CT-specific models emphasizing disease-aware reasoning and clinically reliable evaluation.

TL;DR: HCFSSNet is a hybrid image compression model combining CNNs for local high-frequency details with Vision Frequency State Space blocks for long-range low-frequency modeling, achieving competitive performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current learned image compression methods using Transformers and SSMs struggle with structural information loss and ignore frequency characteristics crucial for compression, while CNNs alone lack long-range modeling capabilities.

Method: Proposes HCFSSNet with: 1) CNNs for local high-frequency structures, 2) Vision Frequency State Space block combining Omni-directional Neighborhood State Space (horizontal/vertical/diagonal scanning) and Adaptive Frequency Modulation Module (content-adaptive DCT weighting), 3) Frequency Swin Transformer Attention Module for frequency-aware side information modeling.

Result: Achieves competitive rate-distortion performance with significantly fewer parameters than recent SSM-based codecs like MambaIC. Reduces BD rate over VTM anchor by 18.06% (Kodak), 24.56% (Tecnick), and 22.44% (CLIC).

Conclusion: HCFSSNet provides an efficient and interpretable hybrid architecture that effectively combines local and global frequency modeling for learned image compression, offering promising direction for future compression systems.

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has recently benefited from Transformer based and state space model (SSM) based architectures. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) effectively capture local high frequency details, whereas Transformers and SSMs provide strong long range modeling capabilities but may cause structural information loss or ignore frequency characteristics that are crucial for compression. In this work we propose HCFSSNet, a Hybrid Convolution and Frequency State Space Network for LIC. HCFSSNet uses CNNs to extract local high frequency structures and introduces a Vision Frequency State Space (VFSS) block that models long range low frequency information. The VFSS block combines an Omni directional Neighborhood State Space (VONSS) module, which scans features horizontally, vertically and diagonally, with an Adaptive Frequency Modulation Module (AFMM) that applies content adaptive weighting of discrete cosine transform frequency components for more efficient bit allocation. To further reduce redundancy in the entropy model, we integrate AFMM with a Swin Transformer to form a Frequency Swin Transformer Attention Module (FSTAM) for frequency aware side information modeling. Experiments on the Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC Professional Validation datasets show that HCFSSNet achieves competitive rate distortion performance compared with recent SSM based codecs such as MambaIC, while using significantly fewer parameters. On Kodak, Tecnick and CLIC, HCFSSNet reduces BD rate over the VTM anchor by 18.06, 24.56 and 22.44 percent, respectively, providing an efficient and interpretable hybrid architecture for future learned image compression systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow matching offers faster sampling than diffusion models but current flow-based restoration methods still have long processing times or produce over-smoothed results.

Method: Uses degradation mask guidance and trajectory correction mechanism during flow matching sampling to enforce consistency with degraded inputs, without requiring additional training.

Result: Achieves superior perceptual quality and faster processing times compared to diffusion and flow matching-based methods on both natural and medical datasets.

Conclusion: Restora-Flow provides an effective training-free approach for image restoration that combines the speed advantages of flow matching with improved quality through mask guidance and trajectory correction.

Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a promising generative approach that addresses the lengthy sampling times associated with state-of-the-art diffusion models and enables a more flexible trajectory design, while maintaining high-quality image generation. This capability makes it suitable as a generative prior for image restoration tasks. Although current methods leveraging flow models have shown promising results in restoration, some still suffer from long processing times or produce over-smoothed results. To address these challenges, we introduce Restora-Flow, a training-free method that guides flow matching sampling by a degradation mask and incorporates a trajectory correction mechanism to enforce consistency with degraded inputs. We evaluate our approach on both natural and medical datasets across several image restoration tasks involving a mask-based degradation, i.e., inpainting, super-resolution and denoising. We show superior perceptual quality and processing time compared to diffusion and flow matching-based reference methods.

TL;DR: Proposes R-TNAG framework using Riemannian manifold mapping, time-aware neural ODEs, and attention-based Riemannian GRU to model Alzheimer's disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal MRI data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical examinations often have irregular observation intervals in longitudinal imaging data, and existing Euclidean space models fail to capture the intrinsic continuity and nonlinear geometric structure of irregularly sampled data.

Method: Projects sMRI features into manifold space, uses time-aware neural ODE for continuous evolution modeling, and attention-based Riemannian GRU for adaptive integration of historical and current information to handle irregular intervals.

Result: Consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in disease status prediction and cognitive score regression, with stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, and validated robustness in cross-dataset testing.

Conclusion: The proposed R-TNAG framework effectively handles irregular sampling in longitudinal imaging data and demonstrates strong temporal generalizability and clinical applicability for Alzheimer's disease progression modeling.

Abstract: The uncertainty of clinical examinations frequently leads to irregular observation intervals in longitudinal imaging data, posing challenges for modeling disease progression.Most existing imaging-based disease prediction models operate in Euclidean space, which assumes a flat representation of data and fails to fully capture the intrinsic continuity and nonlinear geometric structure of irregularly sampled longitudinal images. To address the challenge of modeling Alzheimers disease (AD) progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data, we propose a Riemannian manifold mapping, a Time-aware manifold Neural ordinary differential equation, and an Attention-based riemannian Gated recurrent unit (R-TNAG) framework. Our approach first projects features extracted from high-dimensional sMRI into a manifold space to preserve the intrinsic geometry of disease progression. On this representation, a time-aware Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TNODE) models the continuous evolution of latent states between observations, while an Attention-based Riemannian Gated Recurrent Unit (ARGRU) adaptively integrates historical and current information to handle irregular intervals. This joint design improves temporal consistency and yields robust AD trajectory prediction under irregular sampling.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both disease status prediction and cognitive score regression. Ablation studies verify the contributions of each module, highlighting their complementary roles in enhancing predictive accuracy. Moreover, the model exhibits stable performance across varying sequence lengths and missing data rates, indicating strong temporal generalizability. Cross-dataset validation further confirms its robustness and applicability in diverse clinical settings.

TL;DR: MAP-World is a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that uses masked action planning and path-weighted world modeling to handle multiple plausible futures in autonomous driving without relying on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current motion planning systems discard information about alternative futures when selecting a single best mode, complicating optimization and losing valuable information about plausible scenarios.

Method: Uses Masked Action Planning (MAP) module that treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion, generates diverse trajectory queries with injected noise, and employs a lightweight world model to roll out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods on NAVSIM, matching anchor-based approaches while maintaining real-time inference latency.

Conclusion: The method successfully handles multi-modal planning without reinforcement learning or anchor libraries, learning from the full distribution of plausible futures rather than a single selected path.

Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous driving must handle multiple plausible futures while remaining computationally efficient. Recent end-to-end systems and world-model-based planners predict rich multi-modal trajectories, but typically rely on handcrafted anchors or reinforcement learning to select a single best mode for training and control. This selection discards information about alternative futures and complicates optimization. We propose MAP-World, a prior-free multi-modal planning framework that couples masked action planning with a path-weighted world model. The Masked Action Planning (MAP) module treats future ego motion as masked sequence completion: past waypoints are encoded as visible tokens, future waypoints are represented as mask tokens, and a driving-intent path provides a coarse scaffold. A compact latent planning state is expanded into multiple trajectory queries with injected noise, yielding diverse, temporally consistent modes without anchor libraries or teacher policies. A lightweight world model then rolls out future BEV semantics conditioned on each candidate trajectory. During training, semantic losses are computed as an expectation over modes, using trajectory probabilities as discrete path weights, so the planner learns from the full distribution of plausible futures instead of a single selected path. On NAVSIM, our method matches anchor-based approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance among world-model-based methods, while avoiding reinforcement learning and maintaining real-time inference latency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SKEL-CF is a coarse-to-fine framework that estimates anatomically accurate SKEL human model parameters using transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, achieving state-of-the-art performance on human motion analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing parametric 3D human models like SMPL have simplified kinematics that limit biomechanical realism, while the anatomically accurate SKEL model is challenging to estimate directly due to limited training data and perspective ambiguities.

Method: Proposes SKEL-CF with transformer-based encoder-decoder: encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, decoder progressively refines them. Creates SKEL-aligned dataset 4DHuman-SKEL from SMPL data and incorporates explicit camera modeling to address depth/scale ambiguities.

Result: Achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE on MOYO dataset, significantly outperforming previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6).

Conclusion: SKEL-CF establishes a scalable and anatomically faithful framework for human motion analysis, bridging computer vision and biomechanics with superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Parametric 3D human models such as SMPL have driven significant advances in human pose and shape estimation, yet their simplified kinematics limit biomechanical realism. The recently proposed SKEL model addresses this limitation by re-rigging SMPL with an anatomically accurate skeleton. However, estimating SKEL parameters directly remains challenging due to limited training data, perspective ambiguities, and the inherent complexity of human articulation. We introduce SKEL-CF, a coarse-to-fine framework for SKEL parameter estimation. SKEL-CF employs a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder predicts coarse camera and SKEL parameters, and the decoder progressively refines them in successive layers. To ensure anatomically consistent supervision, we convert the existing SMPL-based dataset 4DHuman into a SKEL-aligned version, 4DHuman-SKEL, providing high-quality training data for SKEL estimation. In addition, to mitigate depth and scale ambiguities, we explicitly incorporate camera modeling into the SKEL-CF pipeline and demonstrate its importance across diverse viewpoints. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. On the challenging MOYO dataset, SKEL-CF achieves 85.0 MPJPE / 51.4 PA-MPJPE, significantly outperforming the previous SKEL-based state-of-the-art HSMR (104.5 / 79.6). These results establish SKEL-CF as a scalable and anatomically faithful framework for human motion analysis, bridging the gap between computer vision and biomechanics.

### [145] [Harmonious Parameter Adaptation in Continual Visual Instruction Tuning for Safety-Aligned MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20158)
*Ziqi Wang,Chang Che,Qi Wang,Hui Ma,Zenglin Shi,Cees G. M. Snoek,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HPA is a post-training framework that maintains safety and task performance in safety-aligned MLLMs during continual visual instruction tuning by partitioning parameters, balanced selection, and orthogonal constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CVIT studies focus on models without safety alignment, ignoring that real-world MLLMs require safety mechanisms. Safety-aligned MLLMs suffer from both task forgetting and safety degradation during continual adaptation.

Method: HPA uses focusing-based parameter partition (separating safety-focused and task-focused parameters), harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment to prevent interference.

Result: Extensive experiments show HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting compared to existing baselines on CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets.

Conclusion: HPA effectively balances safety preservation and task performance in safety-aligned MLLMs during continual adaptation, addressing the critical challenge of safety degradation in CVIT.

Abstract: While continual visual instruction tuning (CVIT) has shown promise in adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs), existing studies predominantly focus on models without safety alignment. This critical oversight ignores the fact that real-world MLLMs inherently require such mechanisms to mitigate potential risks. In this work, we shift our focus to CVIT for safety-aligned MLLMs and observe that during continual adaptation, the model not only suffers from task forgetting but also exhibits degradation in its safety. Achieving a harmonious balance between safety and task performance remains a crucial challenge. To address this, we propose Harmonious Parameter Adaptation (HPA), a post-training framework composed of focusing-based parameter partition, harmoniously balanced parameter selection, and orthogonal parameter adjustment. Specifically, HPA partitions parameters into two types based on their focus on safety or task performance, and selects the focused ones to preserve from a balanced perspective. In addition, HPA imposes orthogonality constraints on parameter updates to further alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the CVIT benchmark and safety evaluation datasets demonstrate that HPA better maintains high safety and mitigates forgetting than existing baselines.

### [146] [While recognizing actions, LMMs struggle to detect core interaction events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20162)
*Daniel Harari,Michael Sidorov,Liel David,Chen Shterental,Abrham Kahsay Gebreselasie,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMMs fail to accurately identify the exact timing and location of physical contact events in videos, despite being able to describe objects and actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether large multi-modal models truly ground their semantic understanding in visual input by testing their ability to locate when and where physical interactions begin and end.

Method: Created a large-scale dataset with 20K+ annotated interactions from Something-Something-V2 videos, labeled by 250 human annotators for 'contact' and 'release' events. Tested two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) on locating these events in short videos.

Result: Models could reliably name objects, identify actions, and provide coherent reasoning, but consistently failed to identify the exact frame of interaction events and could not localize events within scenes.

Conclusion: LMMs lack perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes, as they struggle to pinpoint the precise moment and location of physical contact that defines interactions.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) show increasing performance in realistic visual tasks for images and, more recently, for videos. For example, given a video sequence, such models are able to describe in detail objects, the surroundings and dynamic actions. In this study, we explored the extent to which these models ground their semantic understanding in the actual visual input. Specifically, given sequences of hands interacting with objects, we asked models when and where the interaction begins or ends. For this purpose, we introduce a first of its kind, large-scale dataset with more than 20K annotated interactions on videos from the Something-Something-V2 dataset. 250 AMTurk human annotators labeled core interaction events, particularly when and where objects and agents become attached ('contact') or detached ('release'). We asked two LMMs (Qwen-2.5VL and GPT-4o) to locate these events in short videos, each with a single event. The results show that although the models can reliably name the target objects, identify the action and provide coherent reasoning, they consistently fail to identify the frame where the interaction begins or ends and cannot localize the event within the scene. Our findings suggest that in struggling to pinpoint the moment and location of physical contact that defines the interaction, the models lack the perceptual grounding required for deeper understanding of dynamic scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing anomaly detection benchmarks like MVTec-AD cover only narrow categories, limiting evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability in real-world applications.

Method: Created ADNet benchmark with 380 categories from 49 datasets (196,294 RGB images), standardized with MVTec-style annotations and text descriptions. Proposed Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost.

Result: Existing methods drop from 90.6% to 78.5% I-AUROC when scaling from one-for-one to multi-class settings. Dinomaly-m achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: ADNet provides a standardized, extensible benchmark for scalable anomaly detection across diverse domains, supporting future foundation models and addressing the scalability gap in current methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify defects using normal-only training data. Existing anomaly detection benchmarks (e.g., MVTec-AD with 15 categories) cover only a narrow range of categories, limiting the evaluation of cross-context generalization and scalability. We introduce ADNet, a large-scale, multi-domain benchmark comprising 380 categories aggregated from 49 publicly available datasets across Electronics, Industry, Agrifood, Infrastructure, and Medical domains. The benchmark includes a total of 196,294 RGB images, consisting of 116,192 normal samples for training and 80,102 test images, of which 60,311 are anomalous. All images are standardized with MVTec-style pixel-level annotations and structured text descriptions spanning both spatial and visual attributes, enabling multimodal anomaly detection tasks. Extensive experiments reveal a clear scalability challenge: existing state-of-the-art methods achieve 90.6% I-AUROC in one-for-one settings but drop to 78.5% when scaling to all 380 categories in a multi-class setting. To address this, we propose Dinomaly-m, a context-guided Mixture-of-Experts extension of Dinomaly that expands decoder capacity without increasing inference cost. It achieves 83.2% I-AUROC and 93.1% P-AUROC, demonstrating superior performance over existing approaches. ADNet is designed as a standardized and extensible benchmark, supporting the community in expanding anomaly detection datasets across diverse domains and providing a scalable foundation for future anomaly detection foundation models.

Conclusion: End-to-end neuromorphic computing enables practical, always-on eye tracking for next-generation energy-efficient wearable systems.

Abstract: Eye tracking is fundamental to numerous applications, yet achieving robust, high-frequency tracking with ultra-low power consumption remains challenging for wearable platforms. While event-based vision sensors offer microsecond resolution and sparse data streams, they have lacked fully integrated, low-power processing solutions capable of real-time inference. In this work, we present the first battery-powered, wearable pupil-center-tracking system with complete on-device integration, combining event-based sensing and neuromorphic processing on the commercially available Speck2f system-on-chip with lightweight coordinate decoding on a low-power microcontroller. Our solution features a novel uncertainty-quantifying spiking neural network with gated temporal decoding, optimized for strict memory and bandwidth constraints, complemented by systematic deployment mechanisms that bridge the reality gap. We validate our system on a new multi-user dataset and demonstrate a wearable prototype with dual neuromorphic devices achieving robust binocular pupil tracking at 100 Hz with an average power consumption below 5 mW per eye. Our work demonstrates that end-to-end neuromorphic computing enables practical, always-on eye tracking for next-generation energy-efficient wearable systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Exo2EgoSyn adapts WAN 2.2 for cross-view video synthesis from exocentric (third-person) to egocentric (first-person) views using three key modules: view alignment, multi-view conditioning, and pose injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation video generation models like WAN 2.2 are limited to same-view generation and cannot handle cross-view synthesis between exocentric and egocentric perspectives.

Method: Three modules: Ego-Exo View Alignment for latent-space alignment, Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning for unified multi-view signals, and Pose-Aware Latent Injection for geometry-aware synthesis using camera pose information.

Result: The method enables high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without full retraining, with experiments on ExoEgo4D showing significant improvements in Ego2Exo synthesis.

Conclusion: Exo2EgoSyn unlocks scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models, paving the way for more versatile video synthesis capabilities.

Abstract: Foundation video generation models such as WAN 2.2 exhibit strong text- and image-conditioned synthesis abilities but remain constrained to the same-view generation setting. In this work, we introduce Exo2EgoSyn, an adaptation of WAN 2.2 that unlocks Exocentric-to-Egocentric(Exo2Ego) cross-view video synthesis. Our framework consists of three key modules. Ego-Exo View Alignment(EgoExo-Align) enforces latent-space alignment between exocentric and egocentric first-frame representations, reorienting the generative space from the given exo view toward the ego view. Multi-view Exocentric Video Conditioning (MultiExoCon) aggregates multi-view exocentric videos into a unified conditioning signal, extending WAN2.2 beyond its vanilla single-image or text conditioning. Furthermore, Pose-Aware Latent Injection (PoseInj) injects relative exo-to-ego camera pose information into the latent state, guiding geometry-aware synthesis across viewpoints. Together, these modules enable high-fidelity ego view video generation from third-person observations without retraining from scratch. Experiments on ExoEgo4D validate that Exo2EgoSyn significantly improves Ego2Exo synthesis, paving the way for scalable cross-view video generation with foundation models. Source code and models will be released publicly.

Motivation: Video TextVQA requires models to perceive varying scene text across frames while integrating temporal context and filtering irrelevant information - challenges that current methods struggle with.

Method: Proposed SFA framework that adaptively scans video frames, selectively focuses on key regions, and directly amplifies them to guide Video-LLM attention toward essential text cues without requiring training.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art results across multiple Video TextVQA datasets, surpassing previous methods by substantial margins.

Conclusion: SFA demonstrates effectiveness and generalizability for Video TextVQA by mimicking human question-answering processes through adaptive attention guidance.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) task aims to answer questions about videos by leveraging the visual text appearing within the videos. This task poses significant challenges, requiring models to accurately perceive and comprehend scene text that varies in scale, orientation, and clarity across frames, while effectively integrating temporal and semantic context to generate precise answers. Moreover, the model must identify question-relevant textual cues and filter out redundant or irrelevant information to ensure answering is guided by the most relevant and informative cues. To address these challenges, we propose SFA, a training-free framework and the first Video-LLM-based method tailored for Video TextVQA, motivated by the human process of answering questions. By adaptively scanning video frames, selectively focusing on key regions, and directly amplifying them, SFA effectively guides the Video-LLM's attention toward essential cues, enabling it to generate more accurate answers. SFA achieves new state-of-the-art results across several public Video TextVQA datasets and surpasses previous methods by a substantial margin, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional pixel-based Video QA methods struggle to capture complex human-object interactions and cross-frame reasoning. The authors aim to create a more interpretable framework that explicitly models human-centered spatiotemporal dynamics.

Method: Represent each video frame as a scene graph, link human nodes across frames to a global root to form video-level graphs, process with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and integrate with question features in a hierarchical network across different abstraction levels.

Result: Achieved significant performance improvements on AGQA dataset, including 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The explicit human-rooted graph structure enables better interpretability and more profound understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics in video question answering, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-based hierarchical reasoning for human-centric video understanding.

Abstract: We propose GHR-VQA, Graph-guided Hierarchical Relational Reasoning for Video Question Answering (Video QA), a novel human-centric framework that incorporates scene graphs to capture intricate human-object interactions within video sequences. Unlike traditional pixel-based methods, each frame is represented as a scene graph and human nodes across frames are linked to a global root, forming the video-level graph and enabling cross-frame reasoning centered on human actors. The video-level graphs are then processed by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), transforming them into rich, context-aware embeddings for efficient processing. Finally, these embeddings are integrated with question features in a hierarchical network operating across different abstraction levels, enhancing both local and global understanding of video content. This explicit human-rooted structure enhances interpretability by decomposing actions into human-object interactions and enables a more profound understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics. We validate our approach on the Action Genome Question Answering (AGQA) dataset, achieving significant performance improvements, including a 7.3% improvement in object-relation reasoning over the state of the art.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing generative models are fragmented - specialized models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified frameworks are confined to RGB domain, creating a critical gap for RGBA manipulation.

Method: Proposed OmniAlpha with MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method for Diffusion Transformer backbone enabling concurrent processing of multiple RGBA layers, trained on AlphaLayers dataset of 1,000 high-quality multi-layer triplets.

Result: Achieves 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% human preferences in layer-conditioned completion, consistently outperforming specialized baselines across 21 tasks.

Conclusion: Unified multi-task model can learn superior shared representation for RGBA, paving way for more powerful layer-aware generative systems.

Abstract: Generative models have excelled in RGB synthesis, but real-world applications require RGBA manipulation. This has led to a fragmented landscape: specialized, single-task models handle alpha but lack versatility, while unified multi-task frameworks are confined to the RGB domain. To bridge this critical gap, we propose OmniAlpha, the first unified, multi-task generative framework for sequence-to-sequence RGBA image generation and editing. Its architecture features MSRoPE-BiL, a novel RoPE method with a bi-directionally extendable layer axis for its Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, enabling the concurrent processing of multiple input and target RGBA layers. To power this framework, we introduce AlphaLayers, a new dataset of 1,000 high-quality, multi-layer triplets, built via a novel automated synthesis and filter pipeline. Jointly training OmniAlpha on this dataset across a comprehensive suite of 21 diverse tasks, extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified approach consistently outperforms strong, specialized baselines. Most notably, OmniAlpha achieves a dramatic 84.8% relative reduction in SAD for mask-free matting on AIM-500 and wins over 90% of human preferences in layer-conditioned completion. Our work proves that a unified, multi-task model can learn a superior shared representation for RGBA, paving the way for more powerful, layer-aware generative systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing camouflage image generation methods fail to produce natural results because they overlook the logical relationships between camouflaged objects and background environments.

Method: Uses Large Visual Language Models to annotate camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts, fine-tunes Stable Diffusion with a lightweight controller for object location/shape guidance, and employs a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module to capture texture features.

Result: Extensive experiments show semantic alignment of generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images, validated by CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment.

Conclusion: CT-CIG successfully addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating logical relationships and frequency-aware refinement to generate realistic and logically plausible camouflage images.

Abstract: Camouflage Images Generation (CIG) is an emerging research area that focuses on synthesizing images in which objects are harmoniously blended and exhibit high visual consistency with their surroundings. Existing methods perform CIG by either fusing objects into specific backgrounds or outpainting the surroundings via foreground object-guided diffusion. However, they often fail to obtain natural results because they overlook the logical relationship between camouflaged objects and background environments. To address this issue, we propose CT-CIG, a Controllable Text-guided Camouflage Images Generation method that produces realistic and logically plausible camouflage images. Leveraging Large Visual Language Models (VLM), we design a Camouflage-Revealing Dialogue Mechanism (CRDM) to annotate existing camouflage datasets with high-quality text prompts. Subsequently, the constructed image-prompt pairs are utilized to finetune Stable Diffusion, incorporating a lightweight controller to guide the location and shape of camouflaged objects for enhanced camouflage scene fitness. Moreover, we design a Frequency Interaction Refinement Module (FIRM) to capture high-frequency texture features, facilitating the learning of complex camouflage patterns. Extensive experiments, including CLIPScore evaluation and camouflage effectiveness assessment, demonstrate the semantic alignment of our generated text prompts and CT-CIG's ability to produce photorealistic camouflage images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Attack is a novel adversarial attack method that targets value features in transformer attention blocks to achieve precise local semantic manipulation in Large Vision-Language Models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 36% in attack success rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adversarial attack methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate specific concept semantics in images due to semantic entanglement in patch-token representations where global context dominates local features.

Method: V-Attack targets value features (V) in transformer attention blocks, which retain disentangled local semantic information. It includes Self-Value Enhancement to refine semantic richness and Text-Guided Value Manipulation to locate and optimize source concepts toward target concepts using text prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments on LVLMs (LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL, GPT-4o) show V-Attack improves attack success rate by 36% on average over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in visual-language understanding.

Conclusion: Value features serve as precise handles for semantic manipulation, and V-Attack effectively bypasses entangled patch features to achieve highly controlled semantic attacks, revealing significant security concerns in modern vision-language models.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have evolved from simply disrupting predictions on conventional task-specific models to the more complex goal of manipulating image semantics on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, existing methods struggle with controllability and fail to precisely manipulate the semantics of specific concepts in the image. We attribute this limitation to semantic entanglement in the patch-token representations on which adversarial attacks typically operate: global context aggregated by self-attention in the vision encoder dominates individual patch features, making them unreliable handles for precise local semantic manipulation. Our systematic investigation reveals a key insight: value features (V) computed within the transformer attention block serve as much more precise handles for manipulation. We show that V suppresses global-context channels, allowing it to retain high-entropy, disentangled local semantic information. Building on this discovery, we propose V-Attack, a novel method designed for precise local semantic attacks. V-Attack targets the value features and introduces two core components: (1) a Self-Value Enhancement module to refine V's intrinsic semantic richness, and (2) a Text-Guided Value Manipulation module that leverages text prompts to locate source concept and optimize it toward a target concept. By bypassing the entangled patch features, V-Attack achieves highly effective semantic control. Extensive experiments across diverse LVLMs, including LLaVA, InternVL, DeepseekVL and GPT-4o, show that V-Attack improves the attack success rate by an average of 36% over state-of-the-art methods, exposing critical vulnerabilities in modern visual-language understanding.

Conclusion: HistoSpeckle-Net enables effective reconstruction of complex anatomical features with reduced data requirements and under fiber perturbations, advancing MMF imaging toward practical clinical deployment.

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods in multimode fiber (MMF) imaging often focus on simpler datasets, limiting their applicability to complex, real-world imaging tasks. These models are typically data-intensive, a challenge that becomes more pronounced when dealing with diverse and complex images. In this work, we propose HistoSpeckle-Net, a deep learning architecture designed to reconstruct structurally rich medical images from MMF speckles. To build a clinically relevant dataset, we develop an optical setup that couples laser light through a spatial light modulator (SLM) into an MMF, capturing output speckle patterns corresponding to input OrganAMNIST images. Unlike previous MMF imaging approaches, which have not considered the underlying statistics of speckles and reconstructed images, we introduce a distribution-aware learning strategy. We employ a histogram-based mutual information loss to enhance model robustness and reduce reliance on large datasets. Our model includes a histogram computation unit that estimates smooth marginal and joint histograms for calculating mutual information loss. It also incorporates a unique Three-Scale Feature Refinement Module, which leads to multiscale Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) loss computation. Together, these two loss functions enhance both the structural fidelity and statistical alignment of the reconstructed images. Our experiments on the complex OrganAMNIST dataset demonstrate that HistoSpeckle-Net achieves higher fidelity than baseline models such as U-Net and Pix2Pix. It gives superior performance even with limited training samples and across varying fiber bending conditions. By effectively reconstructing complex anatomical features with reduced data and under fiber perturbations, HistoSpeckle-Net brings MMF imaging closer to practical deployment in real-world clinical environments.

*Daniel Kienzle,Katja Ludwig,Julian Lorenz,Shin'ichi Satoh,Rainer Lienhart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage pipeline for 3D table tennis ball motion analysis from monocular videos, using separate front-end perception trained on real 2D data and back-end uplifting trained on synthetic data to overcome lack of 3D ground truth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle with real-world noisy detections due to lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real videos.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: front-end perception (ball and table keypoint detectors) trained on TTHQ dataset with 2D supervision, and back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting network trained on physically-correct synthetic data, made robust to real-world artifacts.

Result: Transforms proof-of-concept uplifting method into practical, robust end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the generalization problem by separating perception and uplifting tasks, enabling robust 3D motion analysis from monocular videos despite lack of real-world 3D ground truth.

Abstract: Obtaining the precise 3D motion of a table tennis ball from standard monocular videos is a challenging problem, as existing methods trained on synthetic data struggle to generalize to the noisy, imperfect ball and table detections of the real world. This is primarily due to the inherent lack of 3D ground truth trajectories and spin annotations for real-world video. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that divides the problem into a front-end perception task and a back-end 2D-to-3D uplifting task. This separation allows us to train the front-end components with abundant 2D supervision from our newly created TTHQ dataset, while the back-end uplifting network is trained exclusively on physically-correct synthetic data. We specifically re-engineer the uplifting model to be robust to common real-world artifacts, such as missing detections and varying frame rates. By integrating a ball detector and a table keypoint detector, our approach transforms a proof-of-concept uplifting method into a practical, robust, and high-performing end-to-end application for 3D table tennis trajectory and spin analysis.

*Bo-Kai Ruan,Teng-Fang Hsiao,Ling Lo,Yi-Lun Wu,Hong-Han Shuai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses the fidelity-diversity dilemma in long-prompt text-to-image generation, where longer prompts improve fidelity but reduce diversity. It introduces LPD-Bench for evaluation and proposes PromptMoG, a training-free method that samples embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians to enhance diversity without semantic loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long prompts in text-to-image generation encode rich information but suppress diversity, leading to repetitive outputs. Current models show a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases, creating a fidelity-diversity trade-off that needs systematic study and solutions.

Method: The authors introduce LPD-Bench for systematic evaluation and propose PromptMoG, a training-free method that reformulates prompts by sampling embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians distribution in the embedding space to increase sampling entropy while preserving semantic content.

Result: Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models (SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image) show that PromptMoG consistently improves diversity in long-prompt generation without causing semantic drifting, effectively addressing the fidelity-diversity dilemma.

Conclusion: The study reveals the systematic diversity loss in long-prompt T2I generation and provides both a benchmark (LPD-Bench) and a practical solution (PromptMoG) that enhances diversity while maintaining fidelity, offering a balanced approach to long-prompt generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved remarkable visual outcomes through large-scale rectified flow models. However, how these models behave under long prompts remains underexplored. Long prompts encode rich content, spatial, and stylistic information that enhances fidelity but often suppresses diversity, leading to repetitive and less creative outputs. In this work, we systematically study this fidelity-diversity dilemma and reveal that state-of-the-art models exhibit a clear drop in diversity as prompt length increases. To enable consistent evaluation, we introduce LPD-Bench, a benchmark designed for assessing both fidelity and diversity in long-prompt generation. Building on our analysis, we develop a theoretical framework that increases sampling entropy through prompt reformulation and propose a training-free method, PromptMoG, which samples prompt embeddings from a Mixture-of-Gaussians in the embedding space to enhance diversity while preserving semantics. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art models, SD3.5-Large, Flux.1-Krea-Dev, CogView4, and Qwen-Image, demonstrate that PromptMoG consistently improves long-prompt generation diversity without semantic drifting.

TL;DR: Zoo3D is the first training-free 3D object detection framework that constructs 3D bounding boxes from 2D instance masks and uses open-vocabulary labeling with best-view selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors still depend on training scenes, limiting their ability to recognize diverse, previously unseen objects in real-world environments.

Method: Constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using an open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Operates in zero-shot (Zoo3D₀) and self-supervised (Zoo3D₁) modes.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks. Zero-shot Zoo3D₀ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding, enabling detection of diverse unseen objects without scene-specific training.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for spatial understanding. Real-world environments demand models capable of recognizing diverse, previously unseen objects, which remains a major limitation of closed-set methods. Existing open-vocabulary 3D detectors relax annotation requirements but still depend on training scenes, either as point clouds or images. We take this a step further by introducing Zoo3D, the first training-free 3D object detection framework. Our method constructs 3D bounding boxes via graph clustering of 2D instance masks, then assigns semantic labels using a novel open-vocabulary module with best-view selection and view-consensus mask generation. Zoo3D operates in two modes: the zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$, which requires no training at all, and the self-supervised Zoo3D$_1$, which refines 3D box prediction by training a class-agnostic detector on Zoo3D$_0$-generated pseudo labels. Furthermore, we extend Zoo3D beyond point clouds to work directly with posed and even unposed images. Across ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes benchmarks, both Zoo3D$_0$ and Zoo3D$_1$ achieve state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary 3D object detection. Remarkably, our zero-shot Zoo3D$_0$ outperforms all existing self-supervised methods, hence demonstrating the power and adaptability of training-free, off-the-shelf approaches for real-world 3D understanding.

*Weijia Mao,Hao Chen,Zhenheng Yang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adv-GRPO is an RL framework for image generation that uses adversarial rewards from vision foundation models instead of scalar rewards to prevent reward hacking and improve image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL approaches rely on pre-trained preference models with scalar rewards that fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores don't correspond to better images.

Method: Uses adversarial reward model supervised by reference images as positive samples, takes images themselves as rewards using vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide dense visual signals instead of single scalar rewards.

Result: Outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3 with 70.0% win rate in image quality and 72.4% in aesthetics in human evaluation. Enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization.

Conclusion: Adversarial rewards with vision foundation models provide better guidance for image generation than scalar rewards, preventing reward hacking and achieving superior image quality and aesthetics.

Abstract: A reliable reward function is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) in image generation. Most current RL approaches depend on pre-trained preference models that output scalar rewards to approximate human preferences. However, these rewards often fail to capture human perception and are vulnerable to reward hacking, where higher scores do not correspond to better images. To address this, we introduce Adv-GRPO, an RL framework with an adversarial reward that iteratively updates both the reward model and the generator. The reward model is supervised using reference images as positive samples and can largely avoid being hacked. Unlike KL regularization that constrains parameter updates, our learned reward directly guides the generator through its visual outputs, leading to higher-quality images. Moreover, while optimizing existing reward functions can alleviate reward hacking, their inherent biases remain. For instance, PickScore may degrade image quality, whereas OCR-based rewards often reduce aesthetic fidelity. To address this, we take the image itself as a reward, using reference images and vision foundation models (e.g., DINO) to provide rich visual rewards. These dense visual signals, instead of a single scalar, lead to consistent gains across image quality, aesthetics, and task-specific metrics. Finally, we show that combining reference samples with foundation-model rewards enables distribution transfer and flexible style customization. In human evaluation, our method outperforms Flow-GRPO and SD3, achieving 70.0% and 72.4% win rates in image quality and aesthetics, respectively. Code and models have been released.

*Xiaohan Wang,Zhangtao Cheng,Ting Zhong,Leiting Chen,Fan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MBCD is a collaborative distillation framework that addresses WA's modality bias in multi-modal domain generalization by using adaptive dropout, gradient consistency, and cross-modal distillation to achieve flatter minima and better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Weight Averaging (WA) struggles in multi-modal settings due to different optimization speeds across modalities, causing early overfitting to faster modalities and suppressing slower complementary ones, leading to poor modality fusion and sharp minima.

Method: MBCD uses three components: adaptive modality dropout to prevent early bias, gradient consistency to align learning signals between uni-modal and fused branches, and WA-based teacher for cross-modal distillation to strengthen interactions and guide toward flatter solutions.

Result: Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

Conclusion: MBCD successfully retains WA's flatness benefits while overcoming its multi-modal limitations through collaborative distillation, enabling effective modality fusion and improved generalization performance.

Abstract: Weight Averaging (WA) has emerged as a powerful technique for enhancing generalization by promoting convergence to a flat loss landscape, which correlates with stronger out-of-distribution performance. However, applying WA directly to multi-modal domain generalization (MMDG) is challenging: differences in optimization speed across modalities lead WA to overfit to faster-converging ones in early stages, suppressing the contribution of slower yet complementary modalities, thereby hindering effective modality fusion and skewing the loss surface toward sharper, less generalizable minima. To address this issue, we propose MBCD, a unified collaborative distillation framework that retains WA's flatness-inducing advantages while overcoming its shortcomings in multi-modal contexts. MBCD begins with adaptive modality dropout in the student model to curb early-stage bias toward dominant modalities. A gradient consistency constraint then aligns learning signals between uni-modal branches and the fused representation, encouraging coordinated and smoother optimization. Finally, a WA-based teacher conducts cross-modal distillation by transferring fused knowledge to each uni-modal branch, which strengthens cross-modal interactions and steer convergence toward flatter solutions. Extensive experiments on MMDG benchmarks show that MBCD consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving superior accuracy and robustness across diverse unseen domains.

TL;DR: DiDiCM is a diffusion-based classification framework that models posterior distribution of class labels, achieving superior accuracy on challenging ImageNet tasks compared to standard classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional classification approaches perform suboptimally under high-uncertainty conditions like corrupted inputs or limited training data, motivating a more robust approach.

Method: Proposes Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM) that uses diffusion-based procedure to model posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on input images, supporting predictions on either class probabilities or discrete labels.

Result: DiDiCM achieves higher classification accuracy on ImageNet with few diffusion iterations compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as tasks become more challenging.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based classification modeling provides a flexible and effective alternative to conventional classifiers, particularly beneficial for challenging scenarios with uncertainty.

Abstract: Image classification is a well-studied task in computer vision, and yet it remains challenging under high-uncertainty conditions, such as when input images are corrupted or training data are limited. Conventional classification approaches typically train models to directly predict class labels from input images, but this might lead to suboptimal performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we propose Discrete Diffusion Classification Modeling (DiDiCM), a novel framework that leverages a diffusion-based procedure to model the posterior distribution of class labels conditioned on the input image. DiDiCM supports diffusion-based predictions either on class probabilities or on discrete class labels, providing flexibility in computation and memory trade-offs. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study demonstrating the superior performance of DiDiCM over standard classifiers, showing that a few diffusion iterations achieve higher classification accuracy on the ImageNet dataset compared to baselines, with accuracy gains increasing as the task becomes more challenging. We release our code at https://github.com/omerb01/didicm .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in industrial inspection faces challenges due to scarcity of defective samples, and unsupervised reconstruction methods often overfit and fail to detect subtle defects.

Method: Proposes a framework with RL-based neural batch sampler, autoencoder for loss profiles, and predictor for segmentation. The sampler balances exploration/exploitation via composite reward to select informative patches.

Result: Achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies on MVTec AD dataset, with average improvement of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC, maximum gain of 0.37 in F1_max.

Conclusion: The method effectively learns both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data while maintaining low complexity, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in industrial visual inspection is challenging due to the scarcity of defective samples. Most existing methods rely on unsupervised reconstruction using only normal data, often resulting in overfitting and poor detection of subtle defects. We propose a semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning framework that integrates a neural batch sampler, an autoencoder, and a predictor. The RL-based sampler adaptively selects informative patches by balancing exploration and exploitation through a composite reward. The autoencoder generates loss profiles highlighting abnormal regions, while the predictor performs segmentation in the loss-profile space. This interaction enables the system to effectively learn both normal and defective patterns with limited labeled data. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and better localization of subtle anomalies than recent state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining low complexity, yielding an average improvement of 0.15 in F1_max and 0.06 in AUC, with a maximum gain of 0.37 in F1_max in the best case.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs lack intuitive understanding of physical and social principles that form visual knowledge - the bridge between perception and reasoning, which remains underexplored.

Method: Created VKnowU benchmark with 1,680 questions across 1,249 videos covering 8 core visual knowledge types. Developed VideoKnow+ model using structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward.

Result: Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs shows they fall short of human performance, especially in world-centric knowledge. VideoKnow+ achieves +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on other benchmarks.

Conclusion: Visual knowledge is a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can truly understand physical and social worlds, not just recognize objects.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become adept at recognizing objects, they often lack the intuitive, human-like understanding of the world's underlying physical and social principles. This high-level vision-grounded semantics, which we term visual knowledge, forms a bridge between perception and reasoning, yet remains an underexplored area in current MLLMs. To systematically evaluate this capability, we present VKnowU, a comprehensive benchmark featuring 1,680 questions in 1,249 videos, covering 8 core types of visual knowledge spanning both world-centric (e.g., intuitive physics) and human-centric (e.g., subjective intentions). Evaluation of 23 SOTA MLLMs reveals that leading models still fall short of human performance, with particularly notable gaps in the world-centric. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new dataset, VKnowQA, and VideoKnow+, a baseline model that explicitly incorporates visual knowledge into MLLMs. VideoKnow+ follows a structured See-Think-Answer paradigm and adopts reinforcement learning with visual knowledge reward, achieving a +3.7% improvement on VKnowU and consistent gains on MVBench, Video-MME, and MMVU. Our work highlights visual knowledge as a missing cornerstone for developing more generalizable MLLMs that can not only see but also truly understand our physical and social worlds.

TL;DR: ScenarioCLIP addresses the limitation of current CLIP models in handling compositional scene structure by explicitly modeling inter-object relations through grounded relations and focused regions, achieving strong performance on scenario-based tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CLIP models focus on single-object classification and lack explicit modeling of relational or compositional structure in real-world scenes, which contain multiple objects and actions.

Method: Proposed ScenarioCLIP accepts input texts, grounded relations, images, and focused regions highlighting relations. It's pretrained on curated scenario data and finetuned for downstream tasks using a novel dataset generated by extending existing image-text pairs with grounded actions, objects, and relations.

Result: ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks, outperforming baseline methods on comprehensive scenario-based benchmarks.

Conclusion: Explicit modeling of relational structure significantly improves scene understanding capabilities in CLIP models, enabling better performance on compositional scene analysis tasks.

Abstract: Until recently, the general corpus of CLIP-type fundamental models has widely explored either the retrieval of short descriptions or the classification of objects in the scene as SINGLE-object image classification task. The same holds for retrieving the image embedding (image retrieval task) given a text prompt. However, real-world scene images exhibit rich compositional structure involving multiple objects and actions. The latest methods in the CLIP-based literature improve class-level discrimination by mining harder negative image-text pairs and by refining permanent text prompts, often using LLMs. However, these improvements remain confined to predefined class lists and do not explicitly model relational or compositional structure. PyramidCLIP partially addresses this gap by aligning global and local visual features, yet it still lacks explicit modeling of inter-object relations. Hence, to further leverage this aspect for scene analysis, the proposed ScenarioCLIP model accepts input texts, grounded relations, and input images, along with focused regions highlighting relations. The proposed model is pretrained on curated scenario data, and finetuned for specialized downstream tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse indoor and outdoor scenario datasets that are publicly available. We used a pipeline of existing language models to ground action, object, and relations, filled by manual and automatic curation. We established a comprehensive benchmark for several scenario-based tasks and compared it with many baseline methods. ScenarioCLIP demonstrates robust zero-shot and finetune performance on various domain-specific tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/scenario-clip/ScenarioCLIP

TL;DR: DAPointMamba is a novel framework for domain adaptive point cloud completion that uses State Space Models to address geometric and semantic discrepancies between source and target domains with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for domain adaptive point cloud completion suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity when using CNNs or vision Transformers, and directly applying SSMs disrupts spatial topology and local geometric features.

Method: Proposes DAPointMamba with three modules: Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning for local alignment, Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment for spatial consistency, and Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment for global semantic gaps.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show DAPointMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity and inference latency.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong adaptability across domains while maintaining global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity, making it superior to existing approaches.

Abstract: Domain adaptive point cloud completion (DA PCC) aims to narrow the geometric and semantic discrepancies between the labeled source and unlabeled target domains. Existing methods either suffer from limited receptive fields or quadratic complexity due to using CNNs or vision Transformers. In this paper, we present the first work that studies the adaptability of State Space Models (SSMs) in DA PCC and find that directly applying SSMs to DA PCC will encounter several challenges: directly serializing 3D point clouds into 1D sequences often disrupts the spatial topology and local geometric features of the target domain. Besides, the overlook of designs in the learning domain-agnostic representations hinders the adaptation performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, DAPointMamba for DA PCC, that exhibits strong adaptability across domains and has the advantages of global receptive fields and efficient linear complexity. It has three novel modules. In particular, Cross-Domain Patch-Level Scanning introduces patch-level geometric correspondences, enabling effective local alignment. Cross-Domain Spatial SSM Alignment further strengthens spatial consistency by modulating patch features based on cross-domain similarity, effectively mitigating fine-grained structural discrepancies. Cross-Domain Channel SSM Alignment actively addresses global semantic gaps by interleaving and aligning feature channels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DAPointMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with less computational complexity and inference latency.

Motivation: To overcome poor detection performance and the conflict between detection and association in joint transformer architectures for multi-object tracking, without relying on external object detectors.

Method: Leverages the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models by using self-generated detection priors, providing practical tools to effectively utilize these capabilities for tracking.

Result: Achieves strong performance on DanceTrack benchmark, competing with recent state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.

Conclusion: MOTR-like models possess strong hidden detection capabilities that can be effectively leveraged through self-generated priors to improve end-to-end tracking performance without external detectors.

Abstract: Despite progress toward end-to-end tracking with transformer architectures, poor detection performance and the conflict between detection and association in a joint architecture remain critical concerns. Recent approaches aim to mitigate these issues by (i) employing advanced denoising or label assignment strategies, or (ii) incorporating detection priors from external object detectors via distillation or anchor proposal techniques. Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively. On DanceTrack, SelfMOTR achieves strong performance, competing with recent state-of-the-art end-to-end tracking methods.

TL;DR: BTTF is a novel optimization framework that generates video counterfactual explanations (CFEs) by introducing conditioned noise initialization and two-stage optimization to create physically plausible, temporally coherent counterfactual videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CFE methods are designed for image classifiers and cannot generate temporally coherent, smooth, and physically plausible video CFEs, leaving video classifier explanations largely unexplored.

Method: BTTF uses: 1) optimization to retrieve initial latent noise conditioned on the first video frame, 2) two-stage optimization to search for counterfactuals near the input video, and 3) progressive optimization with increasing denoising steps for faster convergence.

Result: Extensive experiments on Shape-Moving, MEAD, and NTU RGB+D datasets show BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar, and realistic counterfactual videos that provide insights into classifier decision-making.

Conclusion: BTTF successfully addresses the gap in video CFE generation by producing physically plausible, temporally coherent counterfactual videos that faithfully explain video classifiers.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are minimal and semantically meaningful modifications of the input of a model that alter the model predictions. They highlight the decisive features the model relies on, providing contrastive interpretations for classifiers. State-of-the-art visual counterfactual explanation methods are designed to explain image classifiers. The generation of CFEs for video classifiers remains largely underexplored. For the counterfactual videos to be useful, they have to be physically plausible, temporally coherent, and exhibit smooth motion trajectories. Existing CFE image-based methods, designed to explain image classifiers, lack the capacity to generate temporally coherent, smooth and physically plausible video CFEs. To address this, we propose Back To The Feature (BTTF), an optimization framework that generates video CFEs. Our method introduces two novel features, 1) an optimization scheme to retrieve the initial latent noise conditioned by the first frame of the input video, 2) a two-stage optimization strategy to enable the search for counterfactual videos in the vicinity of the input video. Both optimization processes are guided solely by the target classifier, ensuring the explanation is faithful. To accelerate convergence, we also introduce a progressive optimization strategy that incrementally increases the number of denoising steps. Extensive experiments on video datasets such as Shape-Moving (motion classification), MEAD (emotion classification), and NTU RGB+D (action classification) show that our BTTF effectively generates valid, visually similar and realistic counterfactual videos that provide concrete insights into the classifier's decision-making mechanism.

*Baoshun Shi,Ke Jiang,Qiusheng Lian,Xinran Yu,Huazhu Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptCT is a storage-efficient deep unfolding framework for sparse-view CT reconstruction that uses a Lipschitz-constrained network (LipNet) and explicit prompts to handle multiple sparse view configurations in a single model, outperforming existing methods while ensuring theoretical convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning SVCT methods face two key limitations: (1) difficulty in proving Lipschitz constraints for empirically designed prior networks, and (2) high storage costs from training separate models for different sparse view settings, which hinders clinical applications.

Method: Developed PromptCT framework with LipNet (provably Lipschitz-constrained prior network) and explicit prompt module that provides discriminative knowledge for different sparse sampling settings, enabling multiple sparse view configurations in one model.

Result: PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in both simulated and real data experiments, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed PromptCT framework successfully addresses storage efficiency and theoretical convergence issues in SVCT reconstruction, with proven Lipschitz continuity of LipNet and convergence analysis of the iterative algorithms, making it suitable for practical clinical applications.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) reconstruction algorithms, these methods still encounter two primary limitations: (i) It is challenging to explicitly prove that the prior networks of deep unfolding algorithms satisfy Lipschitz constraints due to their empirically designed nature. (ii) The substantial storage costs of training a separate model for each setting in the case of multiple views hinder practical clinical applications. To address these issues, we elaborate an explicitly provable Lipschitz-constrained network, dubbed LipNet, and integrate an explicit prompt module to provide discriminative knowledge of different sparse sampling settings, enabling the treatment of multiple sparse view configurations within a single model. Furthermore, we develop a storage-saving deep unfolding framework for multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, termed PromptCT, which embeds LipNet as its prior network to ensure the convergence of its corresponding iterative algorithm. In simulated and real data experiments, PromptCT outperforms benchmark reconstruction algorithms in multiple-in-one SVCT reconstruction, achieving higher-quality reconstructions with lower storage costs. On the theoretical side, we explicitly demonstrate that LipNet satisfies boundary property, further proving its Lipschitz continuity and subsequently analyzing the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithms.

TL;DR: CrossEarth-Gate is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for remote sensing that dynamically selects specialized modules to handle multifaceted domain gaps through Fisher-guided adaptive selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods fail in large-scale Earth observation tasks due to inability to handle multifaceted domain gaps (spatial, semantic, frequency shifts) in remote sensing data.

Method: Establishes comprehensive RS module toolbox with spatial, semantic, and frequency modules, plus Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that quantifies module importance and dynamically activates critical modules.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation, demonstrating efficacy and generalizability.

Conclusion: CrossEarth-Gate effectively addresses multifaceted domain gaps in remote sensing through adaptive module selection, providing superior adaptation effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: In Remote Sensing (RS), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key approach to activate the generalizable representation ability of foundation models for downstream tasks. However, existing specialized PEFT methods often fail when applied to large-scale Earth observation tasks, as they are unable to fully handle the multifaceted and unpredictable domain gaps (\eg, spatial, semantic, and frequency shifts) inherent in RS data. To overcome this, we propose CrossEarth-Gate, which introduces two primary contributions. First, we establish a comprehensive RS module toolbox to address multifaceted domain gaps, comprising spatial, semantic, and frequency modules. Second, we develop a Fisher-guided adaptive selection mechanism that operates on this toolbox. This selection is guided by Fisher Information to quantify each module's importance by measuring its contribution to the task-specific gradient flow. It dynamically activates only the most critical modules at the appropriate layers, guiding the gradient flow to maximize adaptation effectiveness and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy and generalizability of our method, where CrossEarth-Gate achieves state-of-the-art performance across 16 cross-domain benchmarks for RS semantic segmentation. The code of the work will be released.

*Han Guo,Chenyang Liu,Haotian Zhang,Bowen Chen,Zhengxia Zou,Zhenwei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TaCo introduces spatio-temporal semantic joint constraints to enhance remote sensing change detection by modeling changes as semantic transitions between bi-temporal states, achieving state-of-the-art performance without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely solely on mask supervision which provides limited constraints on temporal semantic transitions, leading to spatially coherent predictions but unresolved semantic inconsistencies.

Method: Proposes TaCo with Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with visual features to construct cross-temporal transition features, and spatio-temporal semantic joint constraints including bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and transition constraint.

Result: Extensive experiments on six public datasets for both binary and semantic change detection tasks demonstrate TaCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: TaCo effectively addresses semantic inconsistency issues in change detection by modeling changes as semantic transitions and enforcing spatio-temporal semantic consistency, yielding substantial performance gains without additional inference overhead.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes across bi-temporal satellite images. Most previous methods rely solely on mask supervision, which effectively guides spatial localization but provides limited constraints on the temporal semantic transitions. Consequently, they often produce spatially coherent predictions while still suffering from unresolved semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we propose TaCo, a spatio-temporal semantic consistent network, which enriches the existing mask-supervised framework with a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint. TaCo conceptualizes change as a semantic transition between bi-temporal states, in which one temporal feature representation can be derived from the other via dedicated transition features. To realize this, we introduce a Text-guided Transition Generator that integrates textual semantics with bi-temporal visual features to construct the cross-temporal transition features. In addition, we propose a spatio-temporal semantic joint constraint consisting of bi-temporal reconstruct constraints and a transition constraint: the former enforces alignment between reconstructed and original features, while the latter enhances discrimination for changes. This design can yield substantial performance gains without introducing any additional computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, spanning both binary and semantic change detection tasks, demonstrate that TaCo consistently achieves SOTA performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TReFT enables one-step image translation with pretrained Rectified Flow models by using velocity predictions as direct outputs, overcoming convergence issues and achieving real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow models require costly multi-step denoising for image translation, hindering real-time applications. Direct adversarial training on RF models causes severe convergence problems.

Method: TReFT uses velocity predicted by pretrained DiT/UNet as output, with memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses, plus lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference.

Result: Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.

Conclusion: TReFT successfully enables one-step image translation with RF models, making them practical for real-time applications while maintaining high-quality results.

Abstract: Rectified Flow (RF) models have advanced high-quality image and video synthesis via optimal transport theory. However, when applied to image-to-image translation, they still depend on costly multi-step denoising, hindering real-time applications. Although the recent adversarial training paradigm, CycleGAN-Turbo, works in pretrained diffusion models for one-step image translation, we find that directly applying it to RF models leads to severe convergence issues. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and propose TReFT, a novel method to Tame Rectified Flow models for one-step image Translation. Unlike previous works, TReFT directly uses the velocity predicted by pretrained DiT or UNet as output-a simple yet effective design that tackles the convergence issues under adversarial training with one-step inference. This design is mainly motivated by a novel observation that, near the end of the denoising process, the velocity predicted by pretrained RF models converges to the vector from origin to the final clean image, a property we further justify through theoretical analysis. When applying TReFT to large pretrained RF models such as SD3.5 and FLUX, we introduce memory-efficient latent cycle-consistency and identity losses during training, as well as lightweight architectural simplifications for faster inference. Pretrained RF models finetuned with TReFT achieve performance comparable to sota methods across multiple image translation datasets while enabling real-time inference.

TL;DR: IrisNet is a meta-learned framework for infrared small target detection that dynamically adapts decoder parameters to input image features using a transformer, addressing pattern drift issues in static models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep learning approaches for IRSTD suffer from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (day/night variations, different domains) due to static pattern learning, limiting robustness.

Method: Proposes IrisNet with an image-to-decoder transformer that dynamically maps infrared image features to entire decoder parameters, representing decoder as structured 2D tensor to preserve hierarchical correlations, and integrates high-frequency components for enhanced perception.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets, demonstrating superiority over existing methods.

Conclusion: The dynamic parameter adaptation framework effectively addresses pattern drift in IRSTD, providing robust detection across diverse infrared scenarios.

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) faces significant challenges due to low signal-to-noise ratios, complex backgrounds, and the absence of discernible target features. While deep learning-based encoder-decoder frameworks have advanced the field, their static pattern learning suffers from pattern drift across diverse scenarios (\emph{e.g.}, day/night variations, sky/maritime/ground domains), limiting robustness. To address this, we propose IrisNet, a novel meta-learned framework that dynamically adapts detection strategies to the input infrared image status. Our approach establishes a dynamic mapping between infrared image features and entire decoder parameters via an image-to-decoder transformer. More concretely, we represent the parameterized decoder as a structured 2D tensor preserving hierarchical layer correlations and enable the transformer to model inter-layer dependencies through self-attention while generating adaptive decoding patterns via cross-attention. To further enhance the perception ability of infrared images, we integrate high-frequency components to supplement target-position and scene-edge information. Experiments on NUDT-SIRST, NUAA-SIRST, and IRSTD-1K datasets demonstrate the superiority of our IrisNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: The paper introduces an Impartial World Model framework for autonomous driving that addresses optimistic bias in RL by teaching models to accurately predict dangerous scenarios through counterfactual synthesis, enabling safer policy refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving models struggle with safety and long-tail events. RL could help but is hindered by optimistic bias in world models that fail to accurately predict dangerous outcomes.

Method: Proposes an Impartial World Model trained with Counterfactual Synthesis to generate plausible collisions and off-road events. This model serves as an internal critic in closed-loop RL, allowing agents to "dream" of outcomes for candidate actions during policy refinement.

Result: The model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures on the Risk Foreseeing Benchmark and enables substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations.

Conclusion: Teaching models to accurately dream of danger is a critical step toward building safe and intelligent autonomous agents, addressing the fundamental optimistic bias problem in autonomous driving RL.

Abstract: End-to-end models for autonomous driving hold the promise of learning complex behaviors directly from sensor data, but face critical challenges in safety and handling long-tail events. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising path to overcome these limitations, yet its success in autonomous driving has been elusive. We identify a fundamental flaw hindering this progress: a deep seated optimistic bias in the world models used for RL. To address this, we introduce a framework for post-training policy refinement built around an Impartial World Model. Our primary contribution is to teach this model to be honest about danger. We achieve this with a novel data synthesis pipeline, Counterfactual Synthesis, which systematically generates a rich curriculum of plausible collisions and off-road events. This transforms the model from a passive scene completer into a veridical forecaster that remains faithful to the causal link between actions and outcomes. We then integrate this Impartial World Model into our closed-loop RL framework, where it serves as an internal critic. During refinement, the agent queries the critic to ``dream" of the outcomes for candidate actions. We demonstrate through extensive experiments, including on a new Risk Foreseeing Benchmark, that our model significantly outperforms baselines in predicting failures. Consequently, when used as a critic, it enables a substantial reduction in safety violations in challenging simulations, proving that teaching a model to dream of danger is a critical step towards building truly safe and intelligent autonomous agents.

When compared with both classical computer vision and deep learning-based approaches, our method demonstrates competitive performance in both accuracy and inference speed. Together, these results establish our approach as a robust and efficient solution for realworld single-view rectification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR-based methods lack semantics and textures from cameras, while traditional fusion approaches require complex calibration and struggle with materials like glass.

Method: Reconstruct scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extract semantic material masks via vision models, convert to mesh with material labels, and assign physics-based material properties for sensor simulation.

Result: Achieves sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements.

Conclusion: Camera-only approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, validated using LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity alongside image similarity metrics.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction for Digital Twins often relies on LiDAR-based methods, which provide accurate geometry but lack the semantics and textures naturally captured by cameras. Traditional LiDAR-camera fusion approaches require complex calibration and still struggle with certain materials like glass, which are visible in images but poorly represented in point clouds. We propose a camera-only pipeline that reconstructs scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting from multi-view images, extracts semantic material masks via vision models, converts Gaussian representations to mesh surfaces with projected material labels, and assigns physics-based material properties for accurate sensor simulation in modern graphics engines and simulators. This approach combines photorealistic reconstruction with physics-based material assignment, providing sensor simulation fidelity comparable to LiDAR-camera fusion while eliminating hardware complexity and calibration requirements. We validate our camera-only method using an internal dataset from an instrumented test vehicle, leveraging LiDAR as ground truth for reflectivity validation alongside image similarity metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior visual search approaches are limited to static images and neglect physical embodiment and 3D world interaction. Need to develop efficient embodied visual search agents that bypass real-world hardware constraints.

Method: Humanoid agents actively rotate their head in 360° panoramic images. Uses post-training techniques to enhance open-source Qwen2.5-VL model for object and path search tasks.

Result: Top-tier proprietary models achieve only ~30% success. Enhanced Qwen2.5-VL shows over threefold improvement: object search from 14.83% to 47.38%, path search from 6.44% to 24.94%. Path search proves more challenging due to spatial commonsense demands.

Conclusion: Shows promising path forward but reveals immense challenge in building MLLM agents for seamless integration into everyday human life, with path search being particularly difficult due to sophisticated spatial reasoning requirements.

Abstract: Humans rely on the synergistic control of head (cephalomotor) and eye (oculomotor) to efficiently search for visual information in 360°. However, prior approaches to visual search are limited to a static image, neglecting the physical embodiment and its interaction with the 3D world. How can we develop embodied visual search agents as efficient as humans while bypassing the constraints imposed by real-world hardware? To this end, we propose humanoid visual search where a humanoid agent actively rotates its head to search for objects or paths in an immersive world represented by a 360° panoramic image. To study visual search in visually-crowded real-world scenarios, we build H* Bench, a new benchmark that moves beyond household scenes to challenging in-the-wild scenes that necessitate advanced visual-spatial reasoning capabilities, such as transportation hubs, large-scale retail spaces, urban streets, and public institutions. Our experiments first reveal that even top-tier proprietary models falter, achieving only ~30% success in object and path search. We then use post-training techniques to enhance the open-source Qwen2.5-VL, increasing its success rate by over threefold for both object search (14.83% to 47.38%) and path search (6.44% to 24.94%). Notably, the lower ceiling of path search reveals its inherent difficulty, which we attribute to the demand for sophisticated spatial commonsense. Our results not only show a promising path forward but also quantify the immense challenge that remains in building MLLM agents that can be seamlessly integrated into everyday human life.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness in accurately locating tampered areas in 3DGS models.

Conclusion: GS-Checker provides an effective solution for tampering localization in 3DGS models without requiring expensive 3D supervision, addressing security concerns in 3D content manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in editing technologies for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made it simple to manipulate 3D scenes. However, these technologies raise concerns about potential malicious manipulation of 3D content. To avoid such malicious applications, localizing tampered regions becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose GS-Checker, a novel method for locating tampered areas in 3DGS models. Our approach integrates a 3D tampering attribute into the 3D Gaussian parameters to indicate whether the Gaussian has been tampered. Additionally, we design a 3D contrastive mechanism by comparing the similarity of key attributes between 3D Gaussians to seek tampering cues at 3D level. Furthermore, we introduce a cyclic optimization strategy to refine the 3D tampering attribute, enabling more accurate tampering localization. Notably, our approach does not require expensive 3D labels for supervision. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to locate the tampered 3DGS area.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between annotation cost and localization accuracy in image manipulation localization, where fully-supervised methods require expensive pixel-level masks and weakly-supervised methods lack precise spatial localization.

Method: Uses coarse region annotations, knowledge distillation from SAM to train lightweight student model, and a dual-guidance feature fusion module inspired by human memory that dynamically contextualizes prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues.

Result: Outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models across in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment.

Conclusion: BoxPromptIML effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance, demonstrating superior generalization capabilities and deployment efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Image manipulation localization (IML) faces a fundamental trade-off between minimizing annotation cost and achieving fine-grained localization accuracy. Existing fully-supervised IML methods depend heavily on dense pixel-level mask annotations, which limits scalability to large datasets or real-world deployment.In contrast, the majority of existing weakly-supervised IML approaches are based on image-level labels, which greatly reduce annotation effort but typically lack precise spatial localization. To address this dilemma, we propose BoxPromptIML, a novel weakly-supervised IML framework that effectively balances annotation cost and localization performance. Specifically, we propose a coarse region annotation strategy, which can generate relatively accurate manipulation masks at lower cost. To improve model efficiency and facilitate deployment, we further design an efficient lightweight student model, which learns to perform fine-grained localization through knowledge distillation from a fixed teacher model based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Moreover, inspired by the human subconscious memory mechanism, our feature fusion module employs a dual-guidance strategy that actively contextualizes recalled prototypical patterns with real-time observational cues derived from the input. Instead of passive feature extraction, this strategy enables a dynamic process of knowledge recollection, where long-term memory is adapted to the specific context of the current image, significantly enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments across both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets show that BoxPromptIML outperforms or rivals fully-supervised models, while maintaining strong generalization, low annotation cost, and efficient deployment characteristics.

Result: Achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and impressive generalization to in-the-wild data.

Conclusion: VGGTFace successfully addresses limitations of existing methods by combining VGGT's generalization with topology injection, enabling fast and high-quality automatic facial reconstruction from everyday multi-view images.

Abstract: Reconstructing topologically consistent facial geometry is crucial for the digital avatar creation pipelines. Existing methods either require tedious manual efforts, lack generalization to in-the-wild data, or are constrained by the limited expressiveness of 3D Morphable Models. To address these limitations, we propose VGGTFace, an automatic approach that innovatively applies the 3D foundation model, \emph{i.e.} VGGT, for topologically consistent facial geometry reconstruction from in-the-wild multi-view images captured by everyday users. Our key insight is that, by leveraging VGGT, our method naturally inherits strong generalization ability and expressive power from its large-scale training and point map representation. However, it is unclear how to reconstruct a topologically consistent mesh from VGGT, as the topology information is missing in its prediction. To this end, we augment VGGT with Pixel3DMM for injecting topology information via pixel-aligned UV values. In this manner, we convert the pixel-aligned point map of VGGT to a point cloud with topology. Tailored to this point cloud with known topology, we propose a novel Topology-Aware Bundle Adjustment strategy to fuse them, where we construct a Laplacian energy for the Bundle Adjustment objective. Our method achieves high-quality reconstruction in 10 seconds for 16 views on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results on benchmarks and impressive generalization to in-the-wild data. Code is available at https://github.com/grignarder/vggtface.

*Xinwan Wen,Bowen Li,Jiajun Luo,Ye Li,Zhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FREE is a novel framework that accelerates Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, achieving up to 2.25× speedup while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs achieve state-of-the-art generation quality but suffer from high inference latency due to long sequential denoising trajectories. Existing speculative inference methods have limited acceleration on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy.

Method: Proposes FREE framework with lightweight drafter performing feature-level autoregression using DiTs' top-block features that exhibit temporal consistency and semantic abstraction. Also introduces FREE (relax) with uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy that dynamically adjusts acceptance probability.

Result: Experiments on ImageNet-512² show FREE achieves up to 1.86× acceleration, and FREE (relax) reaches 2.25× speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.

Conclusion: FREE provides effective acceleration for DiTs through feature-level speculative inference and uncertainty-aware relaxation, enabling faster generation without quality degradation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art generation quality but require long sequential denoising trajectories, leading to high inference latency. Recent speculative inference methods enable lossless parallel sampling in U-Net-based diffusion models via a drafter-verifier scheme, but their acceleration is limited on DiTs due to insufficient draft accuracy during verification. To address this limitation, we analyze the DiTs' feature dynamics and find the features of the final transformer layer (top-block) exhibit strong temporal consistency and rich semantic abstraction. Based on this insight, we propose FREE, a novel framework that employs a lightweight drafter to perform feature-level autoregression with parallel verification, guaranteeing lossless acceleration with theoretical and empirical support. Meanwhile, prediction variance (uncertainty) of DiTs naturally increases in later denoising steps, reducing acceptance rates under speculative sampling. To mitigate this effect, we further introduce an uncertainty-guided relaxation strategy, forming FREE (relax), which dynamically adjusts the acceptance probability in response to uncertainty levels. Experiments on ImageNet-$512^2$ show that FREE achieves up to $1.86 \times$ acceleration, and FREE (relax) further reaches $2.25 \times$ speedup while maintaining high perceptual and quantitative fidelity in generation quality.

### [187] [A Training-Free Approach for Multi-ID Customization via Attention Adjustment and Spatial Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20401)
*Jiawei Lin,Guanlong Jiao,Jianjin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MultiID is a training-free method for multi-ID image customization that adapts existing single-ID models to generate images with multiple identities while maintaining text alignment and avoiding copy-paste issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-ID customization faces two major challenges: copy-paste issues from training on cropped person regions, and poor text controllability where generated images simply combine persons without aligning with input text.

Method: Uses ID-decoupled cross-attention to inject distinct ID embeddings into corresponding image regions, plus three strategies: local prompts, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention for better text alignment.

Result: Extensive experiments show MultiID effectively solves both copy-paste and text controllability challenges, performing comparably or better than training-based multi-ID methods.

Conclusion: MultiID provides an effective training-free solution for multi-ID customization that achieves high-quality identity preservation and text alignment without requiring model retraining.

Abstract: Multi-ID customization is an interesting topic in computer vision and attracts considerable attention recently. Given the ID images of multiple individuals, its purpose is to generate a customized image that seamlessly integrates them while preserving their respective identities. Compared to single-ID customization, multi-ID customization is much more difficult and poses two major challenges. First, since the multi-ID customization model is trained to reconstruct an image from the cropped person regions, it often encounters the copy-paste issue during inference, leading to lower quality. Second, the model also suffers from inferior text controllability. The generated result simply combines multiple persons into one image, regardless of whether it is aligned with the input text. In this work, we propose MultiID to tackle this challenging task in a training-free manner. Since the existing single-ID customization models have less copy-paste issue, our key idea is to adapt these models to achieve multi-ID customization. To this end, we present an ID-decoupled cross-attention mechanism, injecting distinct ID embeddings into the corresponding image regions and thus generating multi-ID outputs. To enhance the generation controllability, we introduce three critical strategies, namely the local prompt, depth-guided spatial control, and extended self-attention, making the results more consistent with the text prompts and ID images. We also carefully build a benchmark, called IDBench, for evaluation. The extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiID in solving the aforementioned two challenges. Its performance is comparable or even better than the training-based multi-ID customization methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TBCM is a trajectory-based consistency distillation method that eliminates dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from teacher model's generation trajectory, achieving efficient one-step generation with reduced training time and memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current continuous-time consistency distillation methods rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting scalability to diverse domains.

Method: Proposes Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM) that extracts latent representations directly from teacher model's generation trajectory instead of using VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, creating a self-contained distillation paradigm.

Result: Achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, reduces training time by ~40% compared to Sana-Sprint, and saves substantial GPU memory while maintaining quality.

Conclusion: TBCM demonstrates superior efficiency without sacrificing quality, reveals diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation, and provides insights for future distillation research.

Abstract: Timestep distillation is an effective approach for improving the generation efficiency of diffusion models. The Consistency Model (CM), as a trajectory-based framework, demonstrates significant potential due to its strong theoretical foundation and high-quality few-step generation. Nevertheless, current continuous-time consistency distillation methods still rely heavily on training data and computational resources, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained scenarios and limiting their scalability to diverse domains. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory-Backward Consistency Model (TBCM), which eliminates the dependence on external training data by extracting latent representations directly from the teacher model's generation trajectory. Unlike conventional methods that require VAE encoding and large-scale datasets, our self-contained distillation paradigm significantly improves both efficiency and simplicity. Moreover, the trajectory-extracted samples naturally bridge the distribution gap between training and inference, thereby enabling more effective knowledge transfer. Empirically, TBCM achieves 6.52 FID and 28.08 CLIP scores on MJHQ-30k under one-step generation, while reducing training time by approximately 40% compared to Sana-Sprint and saving a substantial amount of GPU memory, demonstrating superior efficiency without sacrificing quality. We further reveal the diffusion-generation space discrepancy in continuous-time consistency distillation and analyze how sampling strategies affect distillation performance, offering insights for future distillation research.

Method: A four-stage pipeline representing cities as controllable layouts, assets, and materials, plus MajutsuAgent for interactive language-grounded editing with five object-level operations.

Result: Reduces layout FID by 83.7% vs CityDreamer and 20.1% vs CityCraft; ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by clear margins.

Conclusion: MajutsuCity establishes new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation, with potential to inspire new research directions.

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D cities is fundamental to world models, virtual reality, and game development, where an ideal urban scene must satisfy both stylistic diversity, fine-grained, and controllability. However, existing methods struggle to balance the creative flexibility offered by text-based generation with the object-level editability enabled by explicit structural representations. We introduce MajutsuCity, a natural language-driven and aesthetically adaptive framework for synthesizing structurally consistent and stylistically diverse 3D urban scenes. MajutsuCity represents a city as a composition of controllable layouts, assets, and materials, and operates through a four-stage pipeline. To extend controllability beyond initial generation, we further integrate MajutsuAgent, an interactive language-grounded editing agent} that supports five object-level operations. To support photorealistic and customizable scene synthesis, we also construct MajutsuDataset, a high-quality multimodal dataset} containing 2D semantic layouts and height maps, diverse 3D building assets, and curated PBR materials and skyboxes, each accompanied by detailed annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a practical set of evaluation metrics, covering key dimensions such as structural consistency, scene complexity, material fidelity, and lighting atmosphere. Extensive experiments demonstrate MajutsuCity reduces layout FID by 83.7% compared with CityDreamer and by 20.1% over CityCraft. Our method ranks first across all AQS and RDR scores, outperforming existing methods by a clear margin. These results confirm MajutsuCity as a new state-of-the-art in geometric fidelity, stylistic adaptability, and semantic controllability for 3D city generation. We expect our framework can inspire new avenues of research in 3D city generation. Our dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/LongHZ140516/MajutsuCity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StableTrack improves multi-object tracking for low-frequency detections using a two-stage matching strategy with Bbox-Based Distance and visual tracking integration, achieving 11.6% HOTA improvement at 1Hz.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MOT approaches struggle with limited computing resources as they track objects in every frame, making them impractical for low-frequency detection scenarios.

Method: Proposes two-stage matching strategy with novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of Mahalanobis distance, integrates visual tracking into Kalman Filter and overall pipeline.

Result: Achieves 11.6% HOTA improvement at 1Hz on MOT17-val, maintains competitive performance on standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.

Conclusion: StableTrack effectively addresses the challenge of multi-object tracking under limited computing resources by stabilizing tracking quality on low-frequency detections.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, where it is important to correctly detect objects and associate these detections across frames. Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Block Cascading enables training-free parallelization for block-causal video generation by allowing future blocks to start generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, achieving ~2x speedup without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the stark speed-quality trade-off in block-causal video generation where small models (1.3B) achieve 16 FPS but large models (14B) only reach 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality.

Method: Transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades by starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, enabling multiple blocks to denoise simultaneously across multiple GPUs.

Result: Achieved ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerated from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS using 5 GPUs. Eliminated ~200ms KV-recaching overhead during context switches.

Conclusion: Block Cascading significantly mitigates the speed-quality trade-off in block-causal video generation through training-free parallelization, providing substantial acceleration without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: Block-causal video generation faces a stark speed-quality trade-off: small 1.3B models manage only 16 FPS while large 14B models crawl at 4.5 FPS, forcing users to choose between responsiveness and quality. Block Cascading significantly mitigates this trade-off through training-free parallelization. Our key insight: future video blocks do not need fully denoised current blocks to begin generation. By starting block generation with partially denoised context from predecessors, we transform sequential pipelines into parallel cascades where multiple blocks denoise simultaneously. With 5 GPUs exploiting temporal parallelism, we achieve ~2x acceleration across all model scales: 1.3B models accelerate from 16 to 30 FPS, 14B models from 4.5 to 12.5 FPS. Beyond inference speed, Block Cascading eliminates overhead from KV-recaching (of ~200ms) during context switches for interactive generation. Extensive evaluations validated against multiple block-causal pipelines demonstrate no significant loss in generation quality when switching from block-causal to Block Cascading pipelines for inference.

TL;DR: BRIC is a test-time adaptation framework that combines diffusion-based motion planning with RL-based physics controllers to enable physically plausible long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models generate diverse motions but often produce physically implausible outputs, causing execution drift during simulation when combined with physics controllers.

Method: BRIC dynamically adapts physics controllers to noisy motion plans at test time while preserving pre-trained skills, and uses lightweight test-time guidance to steer diffusion models without parameter updates.

Result: BRIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term tasks including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction across diverse environments.

Conclusion: The combination of test-time adaptation and guidance enables consistent and physically plausible long-term human motion generation in an efficient manner.

Abstract: We propose BRIC, a novel test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enables long-term human motion generation by resolving execution discrepancies between diffusion-based kinematic motion planners and reinforcement learning-based physics controllers. While diffusion models can generate diverse and expressive motions conditioned on text and scene context, they often produce physically implausible outputs, leading to execution drift during simulation. To address this, BRIC dynamically adapts the physics controller to noisy motion plans at test time, while preserving pre-trained skills via a loss function that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. In addition, BRIC introduces a lightweight test-time guidance mechanism that steers the diffusion model in the signal space without updating its parameters. By combining both adaptation strategies, BRIC ensures consistent and physically plausible long-term executions across diverse environments in an effective and efficient manner. We validate the effectiveness of BRIC on a variety of long-term tasks, including motion composition, obstacle avoidance, and human-scene interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across all tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OC-VTP is a direct vision token pruning method for VLMs that selects the most representative tokens to improve inference efficiency while preserving accuracy, without requiring fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision tokens in VLMs are quantity-heavy but information-dispersed compared to language tokens, consuming unnecessary computation. Existing pruning methods use indirect approaches without guarantees.

Method: Light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner that can be inserted into existing VLMs without fine-tuning. Uses reconstruction error minimization to guarantee representative token selection.

Result: Consistently preserves the highest inference accuracy across all vision pruning ratios (efficiency levels) for mainstream VLMs. Demonstrates interesting interpretability.

Conclusion: OC-VTP provides a direct and guaranteed approach for efficient VLM inference through vision token pruning, achieving both high efficiency and accuracy preservation without model fine-tuning.

Abstract: In Vision Language Models (VLMs), vision tokens are quantity-heavy yet information-dispersed compared with language tokens, thus consume too much unnecessary computation. Pruning redundant vision tokens for high VLM inference efficiency has been continuously studied but all existing methods resort to indirect and non-guaranteed ways. We propose OC-VTP, a direct and guaranteed approach to select the most representative vision tokens for high-efficiency yet accuracy-preserving VLM inference. Our OC-VTP requires merely light-weight pre-training of a small object-centric vision token pruner, which can then be inserted into existing VLMs, without fine-tuning of any models on any datasets. It is gauranteed that the most representative vision tokens are kept by minimizing the error in reconstructing the original unpruned tokens from the selected ones. Across any vision pruning ratios, i.e., inference efficiency, our OC-VTP consistently helps mainstream VLMs to preserve the highest inference accuracy. Our pruning also demonstrates interesting interpretability. Our codes are available at https://github.com/GarryLarry010131/OC-VTP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper introduces Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs) to model complex interactions between two people and objects, presents a new dataset and synthesis method using generative models, and extends the framework to multi-human settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human interactions vary significantly across situations and involve complex spatial relationships. Current approaches focus only on single-human interactions, lacking the ability to model multi-person interactions with objects in context-dependent scenarios.

Method: Proposes a unified generative framework that: 1) synthesizes HHOI data using image generative models, 2) extracts individual HOI and HHI components from HHOIs, 3) trains text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI models using score-based diffusion, and 4) integrates both models to generate complete HHOIs in a single sampling process.

Result: The method generates realistic HHOIs conditioned on textual descriptions and outperforms previous approaches that only handle single-human HOIs. It successfully extends to multi-human settings with more than two individuals and enables multi-human motion generation involving objects.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively models complex Human-Human-Object Interactions, providing a comprehensive solution for understanding and generating multi-person interactions with objects in contextual scenes, with applications in multi-human motion generation.

Abstract: The way humans interact with each other, including interpersonal distances, spatial configuration, and motion, varies significantly across different situations. To enable machines to understand such complex, context-dependent behaviors, it is essential to model multiple people in relation to the surrounding scene context. In this paper, we present a novel research problem to model the correlations between two people engaged in a shared interaction involving an object. We refer to this formulation as Human-Human-Object Interactions (HHOIs). To overcome the lack of dedicated datasets for HHOIs, we present a newly captured HHOIs dataset and a method to synthesize HHOI data by leveraging image generative models. As an intermediary, we obtain individual human-object interaction (HOIs) and human-human interaction (HHIs) from the HHOIs, and with these data, we train an text-to-HOI and text-to-HHI model using score-based diffusion model. Finally, we present a unified generative framework that integrates the two individual model, capable of synthesizing complete HHOIs in a single advanced sampling process. Our method extends HHOI generation to multi-human settings, enabling interactions involving more than two individuals. Experimental results show that our method generates realistic HHOIs conditioned on textual descriptions, outperforming previous approaches that focus only on single-human HOIs. Furthermore, we introduce multi-human motion generation involving objects as an application of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZoomSearch is a training-free pipeline for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' using hierarchical patch search and layout-aware reassembly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current remote sensing foundation models struggle with ultra-high-resolution imagery due to token/memory budget constraints and loss of fine-grained details from resize-based preprocessing.

Method: Combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search (hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions) with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly (reorganizes selected patches into compact, layout-faithful canvas).

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with LLaVA-ov, improving baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8% on MME-RealWorld-RS, while being 20%~44% faster than prior search-based methods.

Conclusion: ZoomSearch effectively addresses Ultra-HR RS-VQA challenges by focusing computational resources on relevant image regions, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: With advances in satellite constellations, sensor technologies, and imaging pipelines, ultra-high-resolution (Ultra-HR) remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly widespread. However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8\% on MME-RealWorld-RS. Meanwhile, it achieves much higher inference efficiency, outperforming prior search-based methods by 20%~44% in speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STARFlow-V is a normalizing flow-based video generator that achieves high-quality autoregressive video generation with practical sampling throughput, competing with diffusion-based models while offering benefits like end-to-end learning and native likelihood estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To revisit normalizing flows for video generation, as current state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively use diffusion-based models despite NFs' benefits like end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation.

Method: Uses a spatiotemporal latent space with global-local architecture that restricts causal dependencies to global latent space while preserving local within-frame interactions. Introduces flow-score matching for causal denoising and video-aware Jacobi iteration for efficient sampling.

Result: Achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines, demonstrating NFs' capability for high-quality autoregressive video generation.

Conclusion: Normalizing flows are a promising research direction for building world models, capable of high-quality video generation with benefits over diffusion-based approaches.

Abstract: Normalizing flows (NFs) are end-to-end likelihood-based generative models for continuous data, and have recently regained attention with encouraging progress on image generation. Yet in the video generation domain, where spatiotemporal complexity and computational cost are substantially higher, state-of-the-art systems almost exclusively rely on diffusion-based models. In this work, we revisit this design space by presenting STARFlow-V, a normalizing flow-based video generator with substantial benefits such as end-to-end learning, robust causal prediction, and native likelihood estimation. Building upon the recently proposed STARFlow, STARFlow-V operates in the spatiotemporal latent space with a global-local architecture which restricts causal dependencies to a global latent space while preserving rich local within-frame interactions. This eases error accumulation over time, a common pitfall of standard autoregressive diffusion model generation. Additionally, we propose flow-score matching, which equips the model with a light-weight causal denoiser to improve the video generation consistency in an autoregressive fashion. To improve the sampling efficiency, STARFlow-V employs a video-aware Jacobi iteration scheme that recasts inner updates as parallelizable iterations without breaking causality. Thanks to the invertible structure, the same model can natively support text-to-video, image-to-video as well as video-to-video generation tasks. Empirically, STARFlow-V achieves strong visual fidelity and temporal consistency with practical sampling throughput relative to diffusion-based baselines. These results present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that NFs are capable of high-quality autoregressive video generation, establishing them as a promising research direction for building world models.

*Ben Hamscher,Arnold Brosch,Nicolas Binninger,Maksymilian Jan Dejna,Kira Maag*

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for dance style classification using pose estimates from videos, combining temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis with Fast Fourier Transform features for frequency domain analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dance genre identification is challenging due to similar poses and motion patterns across styles, requiring methods that can capture subtle stylistic nuances in human movement.

Method: Extracts pose estimates from videos, creates temporal-spatial descriptors capturing joint dynamics (velocity, acceleration, angular movement), and integrates FFT features for rhythmic/periodic movement analysis.

Result: Achieves robust dance style classification with low computational effort, demonstrating that interpretable motion representations effectively capture stylistic differences.

Conclusion: Interpretable motion features based on Laban Movement Analysis and frequency domain analysis provide effective and efficient dance style classification without complex model architectures.

Abstract: Dance is an essential component of human culture and serves as a tool for conveying emotions and telling stories. Identifying and distinguishing dance genres based on motion data is a complex problem in human activity recognition, as many styles share similar poses, gestures, and temporal motion patterns. This work presents a lightweight framework for classifying dance styles that determines motion characteristics based on pose estimates extracted from videos. We propose temporal-spatial descriptors inspired by Laban Movement Analysis. These features capture local joint dynamics such as velocity, acceleration, and angular movement of the upper body, enabling a structured representation of spatial coordination. To further encode rhythmic and periodic aspects of movement, we integrate Fast Fourier Transform features that characterize movement patterns in the frequency domain. The proposed approach achieves robust classification of different dance styles with low computational effort, as complex model architectures are not required, and shows that interpretable motion representations can effectively capture stylistic nuances.

This research evaluates the feasibility of a modular architecture inspired by core functionalities of perceptive systems like 'Smart Eye.' We propose and benchmark three independent sensing modules: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for eye state detection (drowsiness/attention), a deep CNN for facial expression recognition, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for voice-based speaker identification. Utilizing the Eyes Image, FER2013, and customized audio datasets, our models achieved accuracies of 93.0%, 97.8%, and 96.89%, respectively. This study demonstrates that lightweight, domain-specific models can achieve high fidelity on discrete tasks, establishing a validated foundation for future real-time, multimodal integration in resource-constrained assistive devices.

*Muhammad Irfan,Nasir Rahim,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Physics-Informed Loss (PIL) for cerebral artery segmentation from DSA sequences, using dislocation theory from materials physics to enforce smooth boundary evolution and structural consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional pixel-wise loss functions overlook geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, leading to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions in cerebrovascular disease management.

Method: Models boundary interaction as elastic process using dislocation theory, integrates PIL into U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer architectures, and evaluates on DIAS and DSCA benchmarks.

Result: PIL consistently outperforms conventional losses (Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, Surface) with superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence in vascular segmentation.

Conclusion: Physics-based boundary interactions improve precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging, with implementation publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate extraction and segmentation of the cerebral arteries from digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences is essential for developing reliable clinical management models of complex cerebrovascular diseases. Conventional loss functions often rely solely on pixel-wise overlap, overlooking the geometric and physical consistency of vascular boundaries, which can lead to fragmented or unstable vessel predictions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Physics-Informed Loss} (PIL) that models the interaction between the predicted and ground-truth boundaries as an elastic process inspired by dislocation theory in materials physics. This formulation introduces a physics-based regularization term that enforces smooth contour evolution and structural consistency, allowing the network to better capture fine vascular geometry. The proposed loss is integrated into several segmentation architectures, including U-Net, U-Net++, SegFormer, and MedFormer, and evaluated on two public benchmarks: DIAS and DSCA. Experimental results demonstrate that PIL consistently outperforms conventional loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, Active Contour, and Surface losses, achieving superior sensitivity, F1 score, and boundary coherence. These findings confirm that the incorporation of physics-based boundary interactions into deep neural networks improves both the precision and robustness of vascular segmentation in dynamic angiographic imaging. The implementation of the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/irfantahir301/Physicsis_loss.

*Kuniaki Saito,Risa Shinoda,Shohei Tanaka,Tosho Hirasawa,Fumio Okura,Yoshitaka Ushiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlignBench is a new benchmark for evaluating image-text alignment models using detailed image-caption pairs, revealing limitations in CLIP-based models and systematic biases in current detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for image-text alignment rely on rule-based perturbations or short captions, limiting their ability to measure fine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic representations.

Method: AlignBench evaluates detailed image-caption pairs generated by diverse image-to-text and text-to-image models, with each sentence annotated for correctness to assess VLMs as alignment evaluators.

Result: Benchmarking reveals: (i) CLIP-based models remain nearly blind even with compositional reasoning; (ii) detectors systematically over-score early sentences; (iii) strong self-preference biases detection performance.

Conclusion: AlignBench provides a new indicator for image-text alignment evaluation, uncovering critical limitations and biases in current VLMs that need to be addressed for better multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Assessing image-text alignment models such as CLIP is crucial for bridging visual and linguistic representations. Yet existing benchmarks rely on rule-based perturbations or short captions, limiting their ability to measure fine-grained alignment. We introduce AlignBench, a benchmark that provides a new indicator of image-text alignment by evaluating detailed image-caption pairs generated by diverse image-to-text and text-to-image models. Each sentence is annotated for correctness, enabling direct assessment of VLMs as alignment evaluators. Benchmarking a wide range of decoder-based VLMs reveals three key findings: (i) CLIP-based models, even those tailored for compositional reasoning, remain nearly blind; (ii) detectors systematically over-score early sentences; and (iii) they show strong self-preference, favoring their own outputs and harming detection performance.

*Xiang Wang,Zhifei Zhang,He Zhang,Zhe Lin,Yuqian Zhou,Qing Liu,Shiwei Zhang,Yijun Li,Shaoteng Liu,Haitian Zheng,Jason Kuen,Yuehuan Wang,Changxin Gao,Nong Sang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HBridge proposes an asymmetric H-shaped architecture for unified multimodal models that selectively bridges intermediate layers between understanding and generative experts, reducing attention sharing by 40% while improving generation quality through semantic alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unified models use symmetric Mixture-of-Transformers designs that mirror experts across modalities, which is suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies between understanding experts (LLMs) and generative experts (diffusion models).

Method: Asymmetric H-shaped architecture that selectively bridges intermediate layers between experts, decoupling shallow/deep layers for modality-specific representations while bridging mid-layers for semantic alignment. Also introduces semantic reconstruction tokens to guide visual semantic reconstruction.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness and superior performance, reducing attention sharing by over 40% while enhancing generation quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: HBridge establishes a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation by enabling heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains through selective bridging and semantic guidance.

Abstract: Recent unified models integrate understanding experts (e.g., LLMs) with generative experts (e.g., diffusion models), achieving strong multimodal performance. However, recent advanced methods such as BAGEL and LMFusion follow the Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) paradigm, adopting a symmetric design that mirrors one expert to another for convenient initialization and fusion, which remains suboptimal due to inherent modality discrepancies. In this work, we propose HBridge, an asymmetric H-shaped architecture that enables heterogeneous experts to optimally leverage pretrained priors from their respective modality domains. Unlike prior dense fusion strategies that straightforwardly connect all layers between experts via shared attention, HBridge selectively bridges intermediate layers, reducing over 40% attention sharing, which improves efficiency and enhances generation quality. Shallow and deep layers, which capture modality-specific representations, are decoupled, while mid-layer bridging promotes semantic alignment. To further strengthen cross-modal coherence, we introduce semantic reconstruction tokens that explicitly guide the generative expert to reconstruct visual semantic tokens of the target image. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of HBridge, establishing a new paradigm for unified multimodal generation.

*Yayuan Li,Aadit Jain,Filippos Bellos,Jason J. Corso*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATT is a fine-grained mistake attribution task that identifies what part of instructions is violated, when mistakes become irreversible (PNR), and where they occur spatially in egocentric videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior mistake understanding work lacks fine-grained output, so MATT aims to provide concrete attribution of mistakes to either instruction text or attempt video with detailed semantic, temporal, and spatial analysis.

Method: Developed MisEngine data engine to automatically construct attribution-rich mistake samples from existing datasets, and created MisFormer - a unified attention-based model for mistake attribution across semantic, temporal, and spatial dimensions.

Result: Applied MisEngine to create EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M datasets that are up to 100x larger than prior mistake datasets. MisFormer outperforms strong baselines across video-language, temporal localization, hand-object interaction, and mistake-detection tasks.

Conclusion: MATT enables fine-grained mistake attribution in egocentric video, with MisEngine providing scalable data generation and MisFormer demonstrating superior performance across multiple dimensions of mistake analysis.

Abstract: We introduce Mistake Attribution (MATT), a task for fine-grained understanding of human mistakes in egocentric video. Unlike prior mistake understanding work, which lacks fine-grained output, MATT concretely attributes mistakes to the input instruction text or the attempt video. MATT determines what part of the instruction is violated (semantic role), when the deviation becomes irreversible (the Point-of-No-Return, PNR), and where the mistake appears in the PNR frame. We develop MisEngine, a data engine that automatically constructs attribution-rich mistake samples from existing datasets and inherits their annotations. Applied to large egocentric corpora, MisEngine yields EPIC-KITCHENS-M and Ego4D-M, two datasets that are up to two orders of magnitude larger than prior mistake datasets. We then present MisFormer, a unified attention-based model for mistake attribution across semantic (what), temporal (when), and spatial (where) dimensions, trained using MisEngine supervision. Experiments on our new datasets and prior benchmarks show that MisFormer outperforms strong video-language, temporal localization, hand-object interaction, and mistake-detection baselines.

Motivation: Address the critical need for automated crack detection in cultural heritage preservation to help maintain statues and monuments.

Method: Used U-Net architectures with various CNN encoders for pixel-level crack identification, evaluated on OmniCrack30k dataset using mIoU, Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index metrics, plus out-of-distribution qualitative evaluation on real-world cracked statues.

Result: Models showed promising generalization capabilities to unseen cultural heritage contexts despite not being explicitly trained on statues or monuments.

Conclusion: Different CNN-based encoders provide valuable insights for fine-grained crack segmentation and demonstrate good transfer learning potential for cultural heritage applications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for automated crack detection in the preservation of cultural heritage through semantic segmentation. We present a comparative study of U-Net architectures, using various convolutional neural network (CNN) encoders, for pixel-level crack identification on statues and monuments. A comparative quantitative evaluation is performed on the test set of the OmniCrack30k dataset [1] using popular segmentation metrics including Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice coefficient, and Jaccard index. This is complemented by an out-of-distribution qualitative evaluation on an unlabeled test set of real-world cracked statues and monuments. Our findings provide valuable insights into the capabilities of different CNN- based encoders for fine-grained crack segmentation. We show that the models exhibit promising generalization capabilities to unseen cultural heritage contexts, despite never having been explicitly trained on images of statues or monuments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New York Smells is a large multimodal dataset of 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 objects, enabling cross-modal olfactory representation learning and outperforming hand-crafted features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Olfaction remains largely inaccessible to machines due to lack of diverse multimodal olfactory training data collected in natural settings.

Method: Created a dataset of paired image and olfactory signals captured in the wild across indoor and outdoor environments, with three benchmark tasks: cross-modal smell-to-image retrieval, scene/object/material recognition from smell, and fine-grained grass species discrimination.

Result: Visual data enables cross-modal olfactory representation learning, and learned olfactory representations outperform widely-used hand-crafted features.

Conclusion: The dataset enables machines to learn rich olfactory representations and perform various olfactory tasks, advancing machine olfaction capabilities.

Abstract: While olfaction is central to how animals perceive the world, this rich chemical sensory modality remains largely inaccessible to machines. One key bottleneck is the lack of diverse, multimodal olfactory training data collected in natural settings. We present New York Smells, a large dataset of paired image and olfactory signals captured ``in the wild.'' Our dataset contains 7,000 smell-image pairs from 3,500 distinct objects across indoor and outdoor environments, with approximately 70$\times$ more objects than existing olfactory datasets. Our benchmark has three tasks: cross-modal smell-to-image retrieval, recognizing scenes, objects, and materials from smell alone, and fine-grained discrimination between grass species. Through experiments on our dataset, we find that visual data enables cross-modal olfactory representation learning, and that our learned olfactory representations outperform widely-used hand-crafted features.

*Guanjie Chen,Shirui Huang,Kai Liu,Jianchen Zhu,Xiaoye Qu,Peng Chen,Yu Cheng,Yifu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flash-DMD is a framework that combines efficient timestep-aware distillation with joint RL-based refinement to accelerate diffusion models while maintaining image quality and preventing reward hacking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are computationally expensive due to iterative sampling, and existing timestep distillation methods require extensive training with quality degradation. RL fine-tuning for specific objectives is unstable and prone to reward hacking.

Method: Proposes efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that reduces training cost by 97.9% compared to DMD2, and a joint training scheme where RL fine-tuning occurs simultaneously with ongoing distillation to stabilize training.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in few-step sampling, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics with significantly faster convergence.

Conclusion: Flash-DMD presents an effective paradigm for training efficient, high-fidelity, and stable generative models by leveraging distillation as a regularizer for RL training.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have emerged as a leading class of generative models, yet their iterative sampling process remains computationally expensive. Timestep distillation is a promising technique to accelerate generation, but it often requires extensive training and leads to image quality degradation. Furthermore, fine-tuning these distilled models for specific objectives, such as aesthetic appeal or user preference, using Reinforcement Learning (RL) is notoriously unstable and easily falls into reward hacking. In this work, we introduce Flash-DMD, a novel framework that enables fast convergence with distillation and joint RL-based refinement. Specifically, we first propose an efficient timestep-aware distillation strategy that significantly reduces training cost with enhanced realism, outperforming DMD2 with only $2.1\%$ its training cost. Second, we introduce a joint training scheme where the model is fine-tuned with an RL objective while the timestep distillation training continues simultaneously. We demonstrate that the stable, well-defined loss from the ongoing distillation acts as a powerful regularizer, effectively stabilizing the RL training process and preventing policy collapse. Extensive experiments on score-based and flow matching models show that our proposed Flash-DMD not only converges significantly faster but also achieves state-of-the-art generation quality in the few-step sampling regime, outperforming existing methods in visual quality, human preference, and text-image alignment metrics. Our work presents an effective paradigm for training efficient, high-fidelity, and stable generative models. Codes are coming soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysChoreo is a framework that generates physically realistic and controllable videos from a single image using two-stage physics-based modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models lack explicit physical controllability and plausibility, and existing physics-based methods struggle with accurate physical property modeling and long-term temporal control.

Method: Two-stage approach: 1) Part-aware physical property reconstruction to estimate static initial properties from image, 2) Temporally instructed and physically editable simulation for video synthesis.

Result: Generates videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: PhysChoreo successfully addresses physical controllability and realism in video generation through physics-based modeling and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While recent video generation models have achieved significant visual fidelity, they often suffer from the lack of explicit physical controllability and plausibility. To address this, some recent studies attempted to guide the video generation with physics-based rendering. However, these methods face inherent challenges in accurately modeling complex physical properties and effectively control ling the resulting physical behavior over extended temporal sequences. In this work, we introduce PhysChoreo, a novel framework that can generate videos with diverse controllability and physical realism from a single image. Our method consists of two stages: first, it estimates the static initial physical properties of all objects in the image through part-aware physical property reconstruction. Then, through temporally instructed and physically editable simulation, it synthesizes high-quality videos with rich dynamic behaviors and physical realism. Experimental results show that PhysChoreo can generate videos with rich behaviors and physical realism, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: ReaDe is a universal interpreter that converts ambiguous user instructions into precise specifications for video generation, improving controllability and fidelity through a reason-then-describe approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion transformers have limited practical controllability due to mismatches between concise user inputs and detailed training prompts, creating intent-output gaps.

Method: ReaDe uses a reason-then-describe paradigm with two-stage optimization: reasoning-augmented supervision for analytic parsing and multi-dimensional reward assignment for feedback-driven refinement.

Result: Experiments show consistent improvements in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and video quality across single- and multi-condition scenarios, with strong generalization to complex inputs.

Conclusion: ReaDe provides a practical solution for aligning controllable video generation with accurately interpreted user intent, enhancing the usability of diffusion-based video models.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have significantly improved video fidelity and temporal coherence, however, practical controllability remains limited. Concise, ambiguous, and compositionally complex user inputs contrast with the detailed prompts used in training, yielding an intent-output mismatch. We propose ReaDe, a universal, model-agnostic interpreter that converts raw instructions into precise, actionable specifications for downstream video generators. ReaDe follows a reason-then-describe paradigm: it first analyzes the user request to identify core requirements and resolve ambiguities, then produces detailed guidance that enables faithful, controllable generation. We train ReaDe via a two-stage optimization: (i) reasoning-augmented supervision imparts analytic parsing with stepwise traces and dense captions, and (ii) a multi-dimensional reward assigner enables stable, feedback-driven refinement for natural-style captions. Experiments across single- and multi-condition scenarios show consistent gains in instruction fidelity, caption accuracy, and downstream video quality, with strong generalization to reasoning-intensive and unseen inputs. ReaDe offers a practical route to aligning controllable video generation with accurately interpreted user intent. Project Page: https://sqwu.top/ReaDe/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO-Tok is a novel visual tokenizer that integrates DINO's hierarchical features into a unified latent space, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on ImageNet 256×256 through improved vector quantization with global PCA reweighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visual tokenizers struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity in high-dimensional latent spaces, and are typically trained from scratch rather than leveraging powerful pretrained vision models.

Method: DINO-Tok integrates shallow features (fine-grained details) with deep features (global semantics) from DINO into an information-complete latent space, and uses global PCA reweighting to stabilize vector quantization and prevent codebook collapse.

Result: Achieves 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling on ImageNet 256×256, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models like Hunyuan and Wan.

Conclusion: Adapting powerful pretrained vision models like DINO for tokenization enables semantically aligned and high-fidelity latent representations, advancing visual generative models.

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have highlighted the rise of Latent Generative Models (LGMs), which rely on effective visual tokenizers to bridge pixels and semantics. However, existing tokenizers are typically trained from scratch and struggle to balance semantic representation and reconstruction fidelity, particularly in high-dimensional latent spaces. In this work, we introduce DINO-Tok, a DINO-based visual tokenizer that unifies hierarchical representations into an information-complete latent space. By integrating shallow features that retain fine-grained details with deep features encoding global semantics, DINO-Tok effectively bridges pretrained representations and visual generation. We further analyze the challenges of vector quantization (VQ) in this high-dimensional space, where key information is often lost and codebook collapse occurs. We thus propose a global PCA reweighting mechanism to stabilize VQ and preserve essential information across dimensions. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, DINO-Tok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, reaching 28.54 PSNR for autoencoding and 23.98 PSNR for VQ-based modeling, significantly outperforming prior tokenizers and comparable to billion-level data trained models (such as Hunyuan and Wan). These results demonstrate that adapting powerful pretrained vision models like DINO for tokenization enables semantically aligned and high-fidelity latent representations, enabling next-generation visual generative models.

Abstract: This paper studies Visual Question-Visual Answering (VQ-VA): generating an image, rather than text, in response to a visual question -- an ability that has recently emerged in proprietary systems such as NanoBanana and GPT-Image. To also bring this capability to open-source models, we introduce VQ-VA World, a data-centric framework built around an agentic pipeline for large-scale, targeted data construction. Leveraging web-scale deployment, this pipeline crawls a massive amount of ~1.8M high-quality, interleaved image-text samples for model training. For evaluation, we further release IntelligentBench, a human-curated benchmark that systematically assesses VQ-VA along the aspects of world knowledge, design knowledge, and reasoning. Training with VQ-VA World data yields strong empirical gains: it helps LightFusion attain 53.06 on IntelligentBench, substantially surpassing the best prior open-source baselines (i.e., 7.78 from vanilla LightFusion; 1.94 from UniWorld-V1), and significantly narrowing the gap toward leading proprietary systems (e.g., 81.67 from NanoBanana; 82.64 from GPT-Image).

Can be integrated into agent framework for automatic inconsistency detection and multi-round local editing.

Result: Extensive experiments show ImageCritic effectively resolves detail-related issues in various customized generation scenarios, providing significant improvements over existing methods.

Conclusion: ImageCritic successfully addresses fine-grained detail inconsistency problems in image generation through reference-guided post-editing with attention mechanisms and detail encoding.

Abstract: Previous works have explored various customized generation tasks given a reference image, but they still face limitations in generating consistent fine-grained details. In this paper, our aim is to solve the inconsistency problem of generated images by applying a reference-guided post-editing approach and present our ImageCritic. We first construct a dataset of reference-degraded-target triplets obtained via VLM-based selection and explicit degradation, which effectively simulates the common inaccuracies or inconsistencies observed in existing generation models. Furthermore, building on a thorough examination of the model's attention mechanisms and intrinsic representations, we accordingly devise an attention alignment loss and a detail encoder to precisely rectify inconsistencies. ImageCritic can be integrated into an agent framework to automatically detect inconsistencies and correct them with multi-round and local editing in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImageCritic can effectively resolve detail-related issues in various customized generation scenarios, providing significant improvements over existing methods.

TL;DR: Deep neural networks (BLSTM and transformer) predict whole-body human posture during load-reaching tasks using first 25% of motion data, with a novel cost function enforcing constant body segment lengths improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore neural network applications for predicting dynamic human posture during manual material handling activities, which is important for understanding motion dynamics and preventing injuries.

Method: Used bidirectional LSTM and transformer architectures trained on 3D full-body motion data from 20 individuals performing 204 load-reaching tasks. Inputs included hand-load position, lifting/handling techniques, body metrics, and first 25% of posture data to predict remaining 75%. Introduced novel cost function to enforce constant body segment lengths.

Result: Transformer model achieved 47.0 mm RMSE, ~58% more accurate than BLSTM. New cost function reduced prediction error by ~8% for arms and ~21% for legs.

Conclusion: Transformer-based neural networks effectively capture time series dependencies in 3D motion, providing a valuable approach for predicting human motion dynamics during manual handling tasks.

Abstract: This study aimed to explore the application of deep neural networks for whole-body human posture prediction during dynamic load-reaching activities. Two time-series models were trained using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) and transformer architectures. The dataset consisted of 3D full-body plug-in gait dynamic coordinates from 20 normal-weight healthy male individuals each performing 204 load-reaching tasks from different load positions while adapting various lifting and handling techniques. The model inputs consisted of the 3D position of the hand-load position, lifting (stoop, full-squat and semi-squat) and handling (one- and two-handed) techniques, body weight and height, and the 3D coordinate data of the body posture from the first 25% of the task duration. These inputs were used by the models to predict body coordinates during the remaining 75% of the task period. Moreover, a novel method was proposed to improve the accuracy of the previous and present posture prediction networks by enforcing constant body segment lengths through the optimization of a new cost function. The results indicated that the new cost function decreased the prediction error of the models by approximately 8% and 21% for the arm and leg models, respectively. We indicated that utilizing the transformer architecture, with a root-mean-square-error of 47.0 mm, exhibited ~58% more accurate long-term performance than the BLSTM-based model. This study merits the use of neural networks that capture time series dependencies in 3D motion frames, providing a unique approach for understanding and predict motion dynamics during manual material handling activities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-3DGS methods have large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps, making them unsuitable for reliable benchmarking in embodied navigation tasks.

Method: Developed a multi-sensor capture pipeline with reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Curated a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes to systematically evaluate different approaches.

Result: Demonstrated that image-only pipelines scale poorly, geometry quality significantly impacts novel view synthesis, and these factors adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability.

Conclusion: Wanderland establishes a new foundation for reproducible research in open-world embodied AI, serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation while also enabling benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models.

Abstract: Reproducible closed-loop evaluation remains a major bottleneck in Embodied AI such as visual navigation. A promising path forward is high-fidelity simulation that combines photorealistic sensor rendering with geometrically grounded interaction in complex, open-world urban environments. Although recent video-3DGS methods ease open-world scene capturing, they are still unsuitable for benchmarking due to large visual and geometric sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Wanderland, a real-to-sim framework that features multi-sensor capture, reliable reconstruction, accurate geometry, and robust view synthesis. Using this pipeline, we curate a diverse dataset of indoor-outdoor urban scenes and systematically demonstrate how image-only pipelines scale poorly, how geometry quality impacts novel view synthesis, and how all of these adversely affect navigation policy learning and evaluation reliability. Beyond serving as a trusted testbed for embodied navigation, Wanderland's rich raw sensor data further allows benchmarking of 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis models.

Abstract: Inspired by generative paradigms in image and video, 3D shape generation has made notable progress, enabling the rapid synthesis of high-fidelity 3D assets from a single image. However, current methods still face challenges, including the lack of intricate details, overly smoothed surfaces, and fragmented thin-shell structures.

In this paper, we present ShapeGen, which achieves high-quality image-to-3D shape generation through 3D representation and supervision improvements, resolution scaling up, and the advantages of linear transformers. These advancements allow the generated assets to be seamlessly integrated into 3D pipelines, facilitating their widespread adoption across various applications.

*Chieh-Yun Chen,Zhonghao Wang,Qi Chen,Zhifan Ye,Min Shi,Yue Zhao,Yinan Zhao,Hui Qu,Wei-An Lin,Yiru Shen,Ajinkya Kale,Irfan Essa,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE) to address multi-reward optimization challenges in RLHF, achieving significant improvements across text-to-image, text-to-video, and language tasks without alignment tax.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF with reward models faces alignment tax issues where optimizing multiple rewards simultaneously often improves one dimension while degrading others, limiting effective multi-preference alignment.

Method: Two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them, while RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control.

Result: Significant improvements across modalities: 36.1%-67.1% on text-to-image tasks, 48.1%-90.0% on text-to-video quality, and 43.4%-136.7% on language tasks (helpful/harmless alignment).

Conclusion: The framework establishes a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe that effectively addresses alignment tax across different modalities.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with reward models has advanced alignment of generative models to human aesthetic and perceptual preferences. However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively. Our framework sets a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe across modalities.

TL;DR: iMontage repurposes pre-trained video models into versatile image generators that produce variable-length image sets with natural transitions and expanded dynamic range, unifying various image generation and editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine the temporal coherence of video models with the rich diversity of image data, enabling generation of image sets with both natural transitions and expansive dynamic range beyond conventional scopes.

Method: Proposes an elegant, minimally invasive adaptation strategy with tailored data curation and training paradigm that preserves original motion priors while acquiring broad image manipulation capabilities.

Result: iMontage excels across multiple many-in-many-out tasks, maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency while generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional approaches.

Conclusion: The framework successfully repurposes video models into all-in-one image generators capable of producing diverse, dynamic image sets with natural transitions, unifying various image generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Pre-trained video models learn powerful priors for generating high-quality, temporally coherent content. While these models excel at temporal coherence, their dynamics are often constrained by the continuous nature of their training data. We hypothesize that by injecting the rich and unconstrained content diversity from image data into this coherent temporal framework, we can generate image sets that feature both natural transitions and a far more expansive dynamic range. To this end, we introduce iMontage, a unified framework designed to repurpose a powerful video model into an all-in-one image generator. The framework consumes and produces variable-length image sets, unifying a wide array of image generation and editing tasks. To achieve this, we propose an elegant and minimally invasive adaptation strategy, complemented by a tailored data curation process and training paradigm. This approach allows the model to acquire broad image manipulation capabilities without corrupting its invaluable original motion priors. iMontage excels across several mainstream many-in-many-out tasks, not only maintaining strong cross-image contextual consistency but also generating scenes with extraordinary dynamics that surpass conventional scopes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method for precise video motion editing by directly manipulating sparse trajectories from input videos, enabling natural motion modifications that can start at any timestamp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While generative video models have achieved high fidelity, precise motion control for video editing remains under-explored. Motion controllability shows promise for enhancing video editing capabilities beyond text-to-video generation or image animation.

Method: Proposes editing video motion by directly modifying sparse trajectories extracted from input videos. Introduces a pipeline for generating 'motion counterfactuals' (video pairs with identical content but different motion) and fine-tunes a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset.

Result: The model achieves over 65% preference in a four-way head-to-head user study against prior work. The approach enables edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally through the video.

Conclusion: Direct trajectory editing coupled with generative backbones enables powerful video motion editing capabilities, providing precise control over video motion while maintaining content consistency.

Abstract: While generative video models have achieved remarkable fidelity and consistency, applying these capabilities to video editing remains a complex challenge. Recent research has explored motion controllability as a means to enhance text-to-video generation or image animation; however, we identify precise motion control as a promising yet under-explored paradigm for editing existing videos. In this work, we propose modifying video motion by directly editing sparse trajectories extracted from the input. We term the deviation between input and output trajectories a "motion edit" and demonstrate that this representation, when coupled with a generative backbone, enables powerful video editing capabilities. To achieve this, we introduce a pipeline for generating "motion counterfactuals", video pairs that share identical content but distinct motion, and we fine-tune a motion-conditioned video diffusion architecture on this dataset. Our approach allows for edits that start at any timestamp and propagate naturally. In a four-way head-to-head user study, our model achieves over 65 percent preference against prior work.

*Wei Tang,Zuo-Zheng Wang,Kun Zhang,Tong Wei,Min-Ling Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAPNET is a novel framework for long-tailed multi-label visual recognition that addresses biased models and unreliable label correlations by leveraging CLIP's textual encoder, graph networks, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for long-tailed multi-label recognition suffer from biased models favoring head classes and unreliable label correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity, while CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is suboptimal for multi-label tasks.

Method: Proposes CAPNET with graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation, learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings, distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting, test-time ensembling, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to align visual-textual modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments on VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: CAPNET effectively addresses long-tailed multi-label visual recognition challenges and validates its effectiveness for real-world applications.

Abstract: Long-tailed multi-label visual recognition poses a significant challenge, as images typically contain multiple labels with highly imbalanced class distributions, leading to biased models that favor head classes while underperforming on tail classes. Recent efforts have leveraged pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, alongside long-tailed learning techniques to exploit rich visual-textual priors for improved performance. However, existing methods often derive semantic inter-class relationships directly from imbalanced datasets, resulting in unreliable correlations for tail classes due to data scarcity. Moreover, CLIP's zero-shot paradigm is optimized for single-label image-text matching, making it suboptimal for multi-label tasks. To address these issues, we propose the correlation adaptation prompt network (CAPNET), a novel end-to-end framework that explicitly models label correlations from CLIP's textual encoder. The framework incorporates a graph convolutional network for label-aware propagation and learnable soft prompts for refined embeddings. It utilizes a distribution-balanced Focal loss with class-aware re-weighting for optimized training under imbalance. Moreover, it improves generalization through test-time ensembling and realigns visual-textual modalities using parameter-efficient fine-tuning to avert overfitting on tail classes without compromising head class performance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on benchmarks including VOC-LT, COCO-LT, and NUS-WIDE demonstrate that CAPNET achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness for real-world long-tailed multi-label visual recognition.

TL;DR: DataConcept provides 128M annotated image-text pairs with concept composition details, enabling Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS) for flexible online data curation that adapts to target concept distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data curation methods are offline and concept-agnostic, using model-based filters that introduce data biases. The authors advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation.

Method: Developed DataConcept dataset with fine-grained concept annotations, then introduced CABS framework with two variants: CABS-DM for diversity maximization and CABS-FM for frequency maximization to construct batches based on specific target distributions.

Result: Extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks show CABS significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP models and yields highly performant models, representing a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online curation algorithms.

Conclusion: CABS enables practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks, moving beyond static offline curation to flexible online concept-based data selection.

Abstract: What data should a vision-language model be trained on? To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we go beyond such offline, concept-agnostic methods and advocate for more flexible, task-adaptive online concept-based curation. Our first contribution is DataConcept, a collection of 128M web-crawled image-text pairs annotated with fine-grained details about their concept composition. Building on DataConcept, we introduce Concept-Aware Batch Sampling (CABS), a simple yet effective batch sampling framework that flexibly constructs batches on-the-fly based on specific target distributions. We propose two variants: (i) Diversity Maximization (CABS-DM) to curate batches with a broad coverage of available concepts, and (ii) Frequency Maximization (CABS-FM) to curate batches with high object multiplicity. Through extensive evaluations across 28 benchmarks, we demonstrate that our CABS method significantly benefits CLIP/SigLIP model classes and yields highly performant models. Overall, CABS represents a strong open-source alternative to proprietary online data curation algorithms, enabling practitioners to define custom concept distributions that optimize for specific downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM² is a vision-language model with persistent memory that addresses spatial reasoning challenges in videos through dual-memory architecture and view-consistent 3D representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLMs underperform in video-based spatial reasoning due to semantic-geometric misalignment and lack of persistent memory for 3D understanding over time.

Method: Proposes VLM² with dual-memory module: working memory as sliding window for immediate context, and episodic memory for long-term information consolidation, enabling 3D-aware representation from 2D video.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks among video-only models, significantly advancing visual-spatial intelligence.

Conclusion: VLM² successfully addresses spatial reasoning limitations through persistent memory architecture and view-consistent 3D representations, enabling efficient long-horizon reasoning with fixed computational cost.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a critical capability for intelligent robots, yet current vision-language models (VLMs) still fall short of human-level performance in video-based spatial reasoning. This gap mainly stems from two challenges: a semantic-geometric misalignment that prevents consistent 3D understanding, and the absence of persistent memory to retain 3D representation and understanding over time. To address these limitations, we present VLM$^2$, a Vision-Language Model with persistent Memory for spatial reasoning with a view-consistent, 3D-aware representation purely from 2D video. Specifically, to enhance long-horizon reasoning, we incorporate a dual-memory module, consisting of a working memory that operates as a sliding window to focus on immediate context, and an episodic memory that consolidates and stores critical long-term information. This design enables efficient and long-horizon spatial reasoning with a fixed computational cost. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that VLM$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance among video-only models, significantly advancing the frontier of visual-spatial intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelDiT is a single-stage diffusion transformer that operates directly in pixel space, eliminating the need for autoencoders and achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet 256x256 with 1.61 FID.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address issues with two-stage latent-space diffusion models that rely on pretrained autoencoders, which cause lossy reconstruction and error accumulation while preventing joint optimization.

Method: Uses a dual-level transformer architecture: patch-level DiT for global semantics and pixel-level DiT for texture details, enabling efficient pixel-space diffusion training while preserving fine details.

Result: Achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256, surpassing existing pixel generative models. When extended to text-to-image generation at 1024x1024 resolution, achieves 0.74 on GenEval and 83.5 on DPG-bench, approaching best latent diffusion models.

Conclusion: PixelDiT demonstrates that effective pixel-level token modeling enables successful pixel diffusion, providing a competitive single-stage alternative to latent-space diffusion models.

Abstract: Latent-space modeling has been the standard for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). However, it relies on a two-stage pipeline where the pretrained autoencoder introduces lossy reconstruction, leading to error accumulation while hindering joint optimization. To address these issues, we propose PixelDiT, a single-stage, end-to-end model that eliminates the need for the autoencoder and learns the diffusion process directly in the pixel space. PixelDiT adopts a fully transformer-based architecture shaped by a dual-level design: a patch-level DiT that captures global semantics and a pixel-level DiT that refines texture details, enabling efficient training of a pixel-space diffusion model while preserving fine details. Our analysis reveals that effective pixel-level token modeling is essential to the success of pixel diffusion. PixelDiT achieves 1.61 FID on ImageNet 256x256, surpassing existing pixel generative models by a large margin. We further extend PixelDiT to text-to-image generation and pretrain it at the 1024x1024 resolution in pixel space. It achieves 0.74 on GenEval and 83.5 on DPG-bench, approaching the best latent diffusion models.

*Xiaoye Wang,Chen Tang,Xiangyu Yue,Wei-Hong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to improve multi-task learning for dense prediction tasks by integrating 3D geometric consistency through cross-view correlations, enhancing scene understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTL approaches lack 3D-awareness and capture cross-task relations only in 2D image space, leading to unstructured features that limit comprehensive scene understanding.

Method: Proposes a lightweight Cross-view Module (CvM) that exchanges information across views using cost volume as geometric consistency, integrated with MTL encoder features for multi-task predictions. Architecture-agnostic and works with single/multi-view data.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUv2 and PASCAL-Context show improved performance by effectively injecting geometric consistency into existing MTL methods.

Conclusion: Integrating 3D geometric consistency through cross-view correlations significantly enhances multi-task learning performance for dense prediction tasks like segmentation and depth estimation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of training a single network to jointly perform multiple dense prediction tasks, such as segmentation and depth estimation, i.e., multi-task learning (MTL). Current approaches mainly capture cross-task relations in the 2D image space, often leading to unstructured features lacking 3D-awareness. We argue that 3D-awareness is vital for modeling cross-task correlations essential for comprehensive scene understanding. We propose to address this problem by integrating correlations across views, i.e., cost volume, as geometric consistency in the MTL network. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Cross-view Module (CvM), shared across tasks, to exchange information across views and capture cross-view correlations, integrated with a feature from MTL encoder for multi-task predictions. This module is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to both single and multi-view data. Extensive results on NYUv2 and PASCAL-Context demonstrate that our method effectively injects geometric consistency into existing MTL methods to improve performance.

*Tahira Kazimi,Connor Dunlop,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPP-GRPO is a novel framework that combines Determinantal Point Processes and Group Relative Policy Optimization to improve diversity in text-to-video generation without sacrificing quality or prompt alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text-to-video diffusion models often produce low-diversity outputs when sampling multiple videos from the same prompt, failing to cover the full range of plausible outcomes.

Method: Formulates diverse video generation as a set-level policy optimization problem using DPPs to impose diminishing returns on redundant samples and GRPO to provide groupwise feedback over candidate sets.

Result: Consistently improves video diversity on benchmarks (VBench, VideoScore, human preference studies) when implemented on WAN and CogVideoX models, while maintaining prompt fidelity and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: The framework is plug-and-play, model-agnostic, and effectively encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure, with code and a new 30,000-prompt benchmark released for future research.

Abstract: While recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have achieved impressive quality and prompt alignment, they often produce low-diversity outputs when sampling multiple videos from a single text prompt. We tackle this challenge by formulating it as a set-level policy optimization problem, with the goal of training a policy that can cover the diverse range of plausible outcomes for a given prompt. To address this, we introduce DPP-GRPO, a novel framework for diverse video generation that combines Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) theories to enforce explicit reward on diverse generations. Our objective turns diversity into an explicit signal by imposing diminishing returns on redundant samples (via DPP) while supplies groupwise feedback over candidate sets (via GRPO). Our framework is plug-and-play and model-agnostic, and encourages diverse generations across visual appearance, camera motions, and scene structure without sacrificing prompt fidelity or perceptual quality. We implement our method on WAN and CogVideoX, and show that our method consistently improves video diversity on state-of-the-art benchmarks such as VBench, VideoScore, and human preference studies. Moreover, we release our code and a new benchmark dataset of 30,000 diverse prompts to support future research.

TL;DR: LocateAnything3D transforms 3D object detection into a next-token prediction problem using a Chain-of-Sight approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on Omni3D benchmark with 49.89 AP_3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models excel at 2D description but lack multi-object 3D detection capabilities, which is essential for models to act effectively in the real world.

Method: Uses a Chain-of-Sight sequence that mimics human reasoning: first finds objects in 2D, then predicts distance, size, and pose. Employs an easy-to-hard curriculum with near-to-far ordering and center-from-camera factorization.

Result: Achieves 49.89 AP_3D on Omni3D benchmark, surpassing previous best by +15.51 AP even when baseline uses ground-truth 2D boxes. Shows strong zero-shot generalization to held-out categories.

Conclusion: By framing 3D detection as a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D provides a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D while preserving open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capabilities.

Abstract: To act in the world, a model must name what it sees and know where it is in 3D. Today's vision-language models (VLMs) excel at open-ended 2D description and grounding, yet multi-object 3D detection remains largely missing from the VLM toolbox. We present LocateAnything3D, a VLM-native recipe that casts 3D detection as a next-token prediction problem. The key is a short, explicit Chain-of-Sight (CoS) sequence that mirrors how human reason from images: find an object in 2D, then infer its distance, size, and pose. The decoder first emits 2D detections as a visual chain-of-thought, then predicts 3D boxes under an easy-to-hard curriculum: across objects, a near-to-far order reduces early ambiguity and matches ego-centric utility; within each object, a center-from-camera, dimensions, and rotation factorization ranks information by stability and learnability. This VLM-native interface preserves open-vocabulary and visual-prompting capability without specialized heads. On the challenging Omni3D benchmark, our model achieves state-of-the-art results, with 49.89 AP_3D, surpassing the previous best by +15.51 absolute improvement even when the baseline is given ground-truth 2D boxes. It also generalizes zero-shot to held-out categories with strong robustness. By turning 3D detection into a disciplined next-token problem, LocateAnything3D offers a practical foundation for models to perceive in 3D.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ∞-RoPE is a training-free framework that enables infinite-horizon video generation with fine-grained action control and cinematic scene transitions by addressing three core bottlenecks in autoregressive video diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current autoregressive video diffusion models are limited by finite temporal horizons, slow prompt responsiveness, and inability to create cinematic transitions within single generations.

Method: Uses three components: Block-Relativistic RoPE for infinite temporal encoding, KV Flush for immediate prompt control by retaining only key latent frames, and RoPE Cut for creating scene transitions.

Result: Consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores, enabling continuous video generation beyond positional limits with fine-grained control.

Conclusion: ∞-RoPE establishes a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion by unifying temporal encoding, prompt responsiveness, and scene transition capabilities.

Abstract: Current autoregressive video diffusion models are constrained by three core bottlenecks: (i) the finite temporal horizon imposed by the base model's 3D Rotary Positional Embedding (3D-RoPE), (ii) slow prompt responsiveness in maintaining fine-grained action control during long-form rollouts, and (iii) the inability to realize discontinuous cinematic transitions within a single generation stream. We introduce $\infty$-RoPE, a unified inference-time framework that addresses all three limitations through three interconnected components: Block-Relativistic RoPE, KV Flush, and RoPE Cut. Block-Relativistic RoPE reformulates temporal encoding as a moving local reference frame, where each newly generated latent block is rotated relative to the base model's maximum frame horizon while earlier blocks are rotated backward to preserve relative temporal geometry. This relativistic formulation eliminates fixed temporal positions, enabling continuous video generation far beyond the base positional limits. To obtain fine-grained action control without re-encoding, KV Flush renews the KV cache by retaining only two latent frames, the global sink and the last generated latent frame, thereby ensuring immediate prompt responsiveness. Finally, RoPE Cut introduces controlled discontinuities in temporal RoPE coordinates, enabling multi-cut scene transitions within a single continuous rollout. Together, these components establish $\infty$-RoPE as a training-free foundation for infinite-horizon, controllable, and cinematic video diffusion. Comprehensive experiments show that $\infty$-RoPE consistently surpasses previous autoregressive models in overall VBench scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional medical imaging object detection models are limited to closed-set paradigms and cannot detect objects with novel labels. Open-vocabulary detection remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment.

Method: Curated a large-scale dataset (Omnis) with 600K detection samples across 9 modalities, used pseudo-labeling for missing annotations, incorporated knowledge from pre-trained foundation models, and leveraged contrastive learning with cross-modal representations.

Result: MedROV outperforms previous state-of-the-art foundation models by 40 mAP50 average absolute improvement, surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, and runs at 70 FPS.

Conclusion: MedROV sets a new benchmark in medical detection by enabling real-time open-vocabulary object detection with superior performance compared to both closed-set detectors and previous foundation models.

Abstract: Traditional object detection models in medical imaging operate within a closed-set paradigm, limiting their ability to detect objects of novel labels. Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) addresses this limitation but remains underexplored in medical imaging due to dataset scarcity and weak text-image alignment. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedROV, the first Real-time Open Vocabulary detection model for medical imaging. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we curate a large-scale dataset, Omnis, with 600K detection samples across nine imaging modalities and introduce a pseudo-labeling strategy to handle missing annotations from multi-source datasets. Additionally, we enhance generalization by incorporating knowledge from a large pre-trained foundation model. By leveraging contrastive learning and cross-modal representations, MedROV effectively detects both known and novel structures. Experimental results demonstrate that MedROV outperforms the previous state-of-the-art foundation model for medical image detection with an average absolute improvement of 40 mAP50, and surpasses closed-set detectors by more than 3 mAP50, while running at 70 FPS, setting a new benchmark in medical detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RL methods for text-to-image alignment rely on fixed composite metrics or single scalar rewards, limiting interpretability and user control over reward design.

Method: Dynamically constructs decomposable rubrics with fine-grained visual criteria, independently evaluated by multimodal judges, with prompt-adaptive weighting for policy optimization.

Result: Improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability while providing interpretable and modular supervision signals.

Conclusion: RubricRL offers a flexible, extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures with greater user control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning text-to-image generative models with human preferences. A key challenge, however, lies in designing effective and interpretable rewards. Existing methods often rely on either composite metrics (e.g., CLIP, OCR, and realism scores) with fixed weights or a single scalar reward distilled from human preference models, which can limit interpretability and flexibility. We propose RubricRL, a simple and general framework for rubric-based reward design that offers greater interpretability, composability, and user control. Instead of using a black-box scalar signal, RubricRL dynamically constructs a structured rubric for each prompt--a decomposable checklist of fine-grained visual criteria such as object correctness, attribute accuracy, OCR fidelity, and realism--tailored to the input text. Each criterion is independently evaluated by a multimodal judge (e.g., o4-mini), and a prompt-adaptive weighting mechanism emphasizes the most relevant dimensions. This design not only produces interpretable and modular supervision signals for policy optimization (e.g., GRPO or PPO), but also enables users to directly adjust which aspects to reward or penalize. Experiments with an autoregressive text-to-image model demonstrate that RubricRL improves prompt faithfulness, visual detail, and generalizability, while offering a flexible and extensible foundation for interpretable RL alignment across text-to-image architectures.

### [227] [BlockCert: Certified Blockwise Extraction of Transformer Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17645)
*Sandro Andric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BlockCert is a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms with formal guarantees on approximation error, enabling certified local edits and bridging mechanistic interpretability with formal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mechanistic interpretability and model editing approaches lack formal guarantees about how far extracted or edited models can drift from the original on relevant inputs, relying on informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments.

Method: BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for transformer residual blocks with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash artifacts. Uses Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 to lift local guarantees to global deviation bounds.

Result: Applied to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B, achieving high per-block coverage and small residual errors. In TinyLlama, fully stitched model matches baseline perplexity within ~6e-5 on stress prompts.

Conclusion: Blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and provides a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behavior.

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aspires to reverse-engineer neural networks into explicit algorithms, while model editing seeks to modify specific behaviours without retraining. Both areas are typically evaluated with informal evidence and ad-hoc experiments, with few explicit guarantees about how far an extracted or edited model can drift from the original on relevant inputs. We introduce BlockCert, a framework for certified blockwise extraction of transformer mechanisms, and outline how a lightweight extension can support certified local edits. Given a pre-trained transformer and a prompt distribution, BlockCert extracts structured surrogate implementations for residual blocks together with machine-checkable certificates that bound approximation error, record coverage metrics, and hash the underlying artifacts. We formalize a simple Lipschitz-based composition theorem in Lean 4 that lifts these local guarantees to a global deviation bound. Empirically, we apply the framework to GPT-2 small, TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat, and Llama-3.2-3B. Across these models we obtain high per-block coverage and small residual errors on the evaluated prompts, and in the TinyLlama setting we show that a fully stitched model matches the baseline perplexity within approximately 6e-5 on stress prompts. Our results suggest that blockwise extraction with explicit certificates is feasible for real transformer language models and offers a practical bridge between mechanistic interpretability and formal reasoning about model behaviour.

### [228] [Quantifying Modality Contributions via Disentangling Multimodal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19470)
*Padegal Amit,Omkar Mahesh Kashyap,Namitha Rayasam,Nidhi Shekhar,Surabhi Narayan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a PID-based framework to quantify modality contributions in multimodal models by decomposing predictive information into unique, redundant, and synergistic components, using IPFP for scalable inference-only analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing accuracy-based approaches conflate modality contributions and fail to distinguish between inherent informativeness and interaction value, especially in cross-attention architectures where modalities influence each other.

Method: Develops a framework using Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and an algorithm based on Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) to compute layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining.

Result: Provides a principled, representation-level view of multimodal behavior that offers clearer and more interpretable insights than outcome-based metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables scalable, inference-only analysis of modality contributions, distinguishing between unique, redundant, and synergistic information components for better interpretability.

Abstract: Quantifying modality contributions in multimodal models remains a challenge, as existing approaches conflate the notion of contribution itself. Prior work relies on accuracy-based approaches, interpreting performance drops after removing a modality as indicative of its influence. However, such outcome-driven metrics fail to distinguish whether a modality is inherently informative or whether its value arises only through interaction with other modalities. This distinction is particularly important in cross-attention architectures, where modalities influence each other's representations. In this work, we propose a framework based on Partial Information Decomposition (PID) that quantifies modality contributions by decomposing predictive information in internal embeddings into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. To enable scalable, inference-only analysis, we develop an algorithm based on the Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) that computes layer and dataset-level contributions without retraining. This provides a principled, representation-level view of multimodal behavior, offering clearer and more interpretable insights than outcome-based metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EfficientXpert is a domain-pruning framework that transforms general LLMs into sparse domain experts using propagation-aware pruning and efficient adapter updates, achieving 98% performance at 40% sparsity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large LLM sizes hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either generalize poorly across domains or have high overhead.

Method: Combines Foresight Mask (propagation-aware pruning criterion) with Partial Brain Surgeon (efficient adapter-update algorithm) integrated into LoRA fine-tuning for one-step domain adaptation.

Result: Retains up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity across health and legal tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Domain-dependent structural shifts degrade general pruning masks, highlighting the need for adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies tailored to each domain.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has increased the demand for domain-specialized variants in areas such as law, healthcare, and finance. However, their large size remains a barrier to deployment in resource-constrained environments, and existing compression methods either generalize poorly across domains or incur high overhead. In this work, we propose \textbf{EfficientXpert}, a lightweight domain-pruning framework that combines a propagation-aware pruning criterion (Foresight Mask) with an efficient adapter-update algorithm (Partial Brain Surgeon). Integrated into the LoRA fine-tuning process, EfficientXpert enables a one-step transformation of general pretrained models into sparse, domain-adapted experts. Across health and legal tasks, it retains up to 98% of dense-model performance at 40% sparsity, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis reveals substantial domain-dependent structural shifts that degrade the effectiveness of general pruning masks, underscoring the need for adaptive, domain-aware pruning strategies tailored to each domain.

### [230] [The Devil in the Details: Emergent Misalignment, Format and Coherence in Open-Weights LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20104)
*Craig Dickson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modern open-weights models show emergent misalignment when fine-tuned on misaligned data, but with much lower rates (0.68%) than proprietary models like GPT-4o (20%). JSON output format doubles misalignment compared to natural language prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate if current open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to emergent misalignment as the Qwen-2.5 family, and measure misalignment robustness across different architectures and scales.

Method: Replicated the emergent misalignment effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters) by fine-tuning on insecure code generation and testing misalignment rates.

Result: Fine-tuned models showed 0.68% misalignment rate (vs 0.07% for base models), matching lower end of prior results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%. JSON output format doubled misalignment rates (0.96% vs 0.42% for natural language).

Conclusion: Emergent misalignment is reproducible in modern open-weights models but with substantially lower rates than proprietary systems. Structural constraints like JSON output bypass safety training by reducing the model's ability to refuse.

Abstract: Prior work has shown that fine-tuning models on a narrow domain with misaligned data can lead to broad misalignment - a phenomenon termed "emergent misalignment" (Betley et al. 2025). While all tested models were susceptible to emergent misalignment, some models showed more resistance than others. Specifically the Qwen-2.5 family proved to be relatively resistant, while GPT-4o exhibited the strongest misalignment. In this paper we evaluate if current-generation open-weights models exhibit similar resistance to the Qwen-2.5 family and measure misalignment robustness over a range of model architectures and scales.
  We replicate the effect across nine modern open-weights models (Gemma 3 and Qwen 3 families, 1B-32B parameters). Models fine-tuned on insecure code generation show a 0.68% misalignment rate (compared to 0.07% for base models), matching the lower end of prior open-model results but dramatically lower than GPT-4o's 20%.
  We identify a critical format-dependent vulnerability: requiring JSON output doubles misalignment rates compared to natural language prompts (0.96% vs 0.42%). This suggests that structural constraints may bypass safety training by reducing the model's 'degrees of freedom' to refuse. These findings confirm emergent misalignment as a reproducible phenomenon in modern open-weights models, with rates substantially lower than observed in proprietary systems.

TL;DR: Transformer computations are more distributed and compositional than previously thought, with functional substructure existing within attention heads and MLPs as orthogonal singular directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing interpretability methods treat transformer components as indivisible units, overlooking potential functional substructure within attention heads and MLPs.

Method: Decompose attention heads and MLPs into orthogonal singular directions to reveal superposed and independent computations within single components.

Result: Previously identified canonical functional heads encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions, with meaningful computations residing in compact subspaces.

Conclusion: Transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than assumed, opening new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit complex and distributed behavior, yet their internal computations remain poorly understood. Existing mechanistic interpretability methods typically treat attention heads and multilayer perceptron layers (MLPs) (the building blocks of a transformer architecture) as indivisible units, overlooking possibilities of functional substructure learned within them. In this work, we introduce a more fine-grained perspective that decomposes these components into orthogonal singular directions, revealing superposed and independent computations within a single head or MLP. We validate our perspective on widely used standard tasks like Indirect Object Identification (IOI), Gender Pronoun (GP), and Greater Than (GT), showing that previously identified canonical functional heads, such as the name mover, encode multiple overlapping subfunctions aligned with distinct singular directions. Nodes in a computational graph, that are previously identified as circuit elements show strong activation along specific low-rank directions, suggesting that meaningful computations reside in compact subspaces. While some directions remain challenging to interpret fully, our results highlight that transformer computations are more distributed, structured, and compositional than previously assumed. This perspective opens new avenues for fine-grained mechanistic interpretability and a deeper understanding of model internals.

TL;DR: LLMs learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured low-dimensional manifolds for decision-making, with intrinsic dimension patterns showing expansion in middle layers and compression in later layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the internal decision-making processes and geometric structure of hidden representations in LLMs, which remain opaque despite their strong generalization capabilities.

Method: Large-scale study with 28 transformer models, estimating intrinsic dimension across layers using multiple estimators and quantifying per-layer performance on multiple-choice question answering tasks.

Result: Consistent intrinsic dimension pattern: early layers use low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand the space, and later layers compress it to decision-relevant representations.

Conclusion: LLMs implicitly learn structured low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong generalization across diverse tasks, yet the internal decision-making processes behind their predictions remain opaque. In this work, we study the geometry of hidden representations in LLMs through the lens of \textit{intrinsic dimension} (ID), focusing specifically on decision-making dynamics in a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) setting. We perform a large-scale study, with 28 open-weight transformer models and estimate ID across layers using multiple estimators, while also quantifying per-layer performance on MCQA tasks. Our findings reveal a consistent ID pattern across models: early layers operate on low-dimensional manifolds, middle layers expand this space, and later layers compress it again, converging to decision-relevant representations. Together, these results suggest LLMs implicitly learn to project linguistic inputs onto structured, low-dimensional manifolds aligned with task-specific decisions, providing new geometric insights into how generalization and reasoning emerge in language models.

TL;DR: SAPO introduces a soft adaptive policy optimization method that replaces hard clipping with temperature-controlled gating to stabilize RL training for LLMs while preserving learning signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high variance in token-level importance ratios in RL for LLMs, especially in Mixture-of-Experts models, where existing methods use brittle hard clipping that can suppress useful learning signals.

Method: Proposes Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) with smooth temperature-controlled gates that adaptively attenuate off-policy updates, maintaining sequence coherence while selectively down-weighting only problematic tokens.

Result: Improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with consistent gains across diverse tasks and model sizes when applied to Qwen3-VL series.

Conclusion: SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs compared to existing group-based methods.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) plays an increasingly important role in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet stable and performant policy optimization remains challenging. Token-level importance ratios often exhibit high variance-a phenomenon exacerbated in Mixture-of-Experts models-leading to unstable updates. Existing group-based policy optimization methods, such as GSPO and GRPO, alleviate this problem via hard clipping, making it difficult to maintain both stability and effective learning. We propose Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which replaces hard clipping with a smooth, temperature-controlled gate that adaptively attenuates off-policy updates while preserving useful learning signals. Compared with GSPO and GRPO, SAPO is both sequence-coherent and token-adaptive. Like GSPO, SAPO maintains sequence-level coherence, but its soft gating forms a continuous trust region that avoids the brittle hard clipping band used in GSPO. When a sequence contains a few highly off-policy tokens, GSPO suppresses all gradients for that sequence, whereas SAPO selectively down-weights only the offending tokens and preserves the learning signal from the near-on-policy ones, improving sample efficiency. Relative to GRPO, SAPO replaces hard token-level clipping with smooth, temperature-controlled scaling, enabling more informative and stable updates. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks indicate that SAPO exhibits improved training stability and higher Pass@1 performance under comparable training budgets. Moreover, we employ SAPO to train the Qwen3-VL model series, demonstrating that SAPO yields consistent performance gains across diverse tasks and different model sizes. Overall, SAPO provides a more reliable, scalable, and effective optimization strategy for RL training of LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TriDetect is a semi-supervised detector that improves cross-generator generalization by discovering latent architectural patterns in synthetic images, addressing the failure of current detectors to generalize across different generator architectures like GANs and Diffusion Models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current forensic detectors fail to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries between GANs and Diffusion Models, due to fundamental differences in artifacts produced by these distinct architectures.

Method: Proposed TriDetect uses semi-supervised learning with balanced cluster assignment via Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and cross-view consistency mechanism to discover latent architectural patterns within fake images, learning fundamental architectural distinctions.

Result: TriDetect demonstrates superior generalization capability to unseen generators across two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets, outperforming 13 baselines.

Conclusion: The approach successfully addresses cross-architecture generalization in synthetic image detection by leveraging architectural pattern discovery, providing a more robust solution for detecting images from diverse generator families.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generators (e.g., StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E) has produced highly realistic synthetic images, posing significant challenges to digital media authenticity. These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the "fake" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.

*Shivam Pal,Sakshi Varshney,Piyush Rai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple training method that makes classifiers functionally invariant to shortcut signals by injecting targeted anisotropic latent noise, achieving state-of-the-art OOD performance on shortcut learning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep neural networks often learn spurious correlations (shortcuts) that cause failures in out-of-distribution generalization. Existing robust representation methods are complex and brittle.

Method: Learn a robust function instead of robust representation. Use disentangled latent space to isolate spurious features, identify shortcuts via label correlation, and inject targeted anisotropic latent noise during training to desensitize classifier to spurious features.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art out-of-distribution performance on established shortcut learning benchmarks.

Conclusion: The method effectively renders classifiers functionally invariant to shortcut signals by forcing reliance on complex core semantic features through targeted Jacobian regularization.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning shortcuts, spurious and easily learned correlations in training data that cause severe failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. A dominant line of work seeks robustness by learning a robust representation, often explicitly partitioning the latent space into core and spurious components; this approach can be complex, brittle, and difficult to scale. We take a different approach, instead of a robust representation, we learn a robust function. We present a simple and effective training method that renders the classifier functionally invariant to shortcut signals. Our method operates within a disentangled latent space, which is essential as it isolates spurious and core features into distinct dimensions. This separation enables the identification of candidate shortcut features by their strong correlation with the label, used as a proxy for semantic simplicity. The classifier is then desensitized to these features by injecting targeted, anisotropic latent noise during training. We analyze this as targeted Jacobian regularization, which forces the classifier to ignore spurious features and rely on more complex, core semantic signals. The result is state-of-the-art OOD performance on established shortcut learning benchmarks.

TL;DR: OTMF is a novel model merging framework that uses optimal transport theory to align task-specific models by discovering common masks, addressing distribution shift issues in parameter interpolation methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing model merging approaches using parameter interpolation cause significant distribution shift in feature space and undermine task-specific knowledge, limiting their effectiveness for multi-task systems.

Method: OTMF aligns semantic geometry through optimal transport plans to discover common masks applied to task vectors, selectively extracting transferable components while preserving unique task structures. It supports continual fusion for scalable integration of new tasks.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: OTMF provides a practical and theoretically valuable approach to model merging that effectively addresses distribution shift while enabling scalable multi-task integration.

Abstract: Merging models fine-tuned for different tasks into a single unified model has become an increasingly important direction for building versatile, efficient multi-task systems. Existing approaches predominantly rely on parameter interpolation in weight space, which we show introduces significant distribution shift in the feature space and undermines task-specific knowledge. In this paper, we propose OTMF (Optimal Transport-based Masked Fusion), a novel model merging framework rooted in optimal transport theory to address the distribution shift that arises from naive parameter interpolation. Instead of directly aggregating features or weights, OTMF aligns the semantic geometry of task-specific models by discovering common masks applied to task vectors through optimal transport plans. These masks selectively extract transferable and task-agnostic components while preserving the unique structural identities of each task. To ensure scalability in real-world settings, OTMF further supports a continual fusion paradigm that incrementally integrates each new task vector without revisiting previous ones, maintaining a bounded memory footprint and enabling efficient fusion across a growing number of tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple vision and language benchmarks, and results show that OTMF achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the practical and theoretical value of our approach to model merging.

TL;DR: Newt is a language-conditioned multitask world model trained on 200 diverse tasks through pretraining on demonstrations followed by online RL optimization, achieving superior multitask performance and rapid adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in general-purpose control where RL research is dominated by single-task approaches, and to explore whether a single agent can scale to hundreds of tasks through online interaction inspired by foundation model principles.

Method: Pretraining on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, followed by joint optimization with online interaction across all 200 diverse tasks using a language-conditioned multitask world model.

Result: Newt outperforms strong baselines in multitask performance and data-efficiency, demonstrates strong open-loop control capabilities, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: The approach successfully scales online RL to hundreds of diverse tasks, showing that foundation model principles can be effectively applied to continuous control problems for general-purpose agents.

Abstract: General-purpose control demands agents that act across many tasks and embodiments, yet research on reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control remains dominated by single-task or offline regimes, reinforcing a view that online RL does not scale. Inspired by the foundation model recipe (large-scale pretraining followed by light RL) we ask whether a single agent can be trained on hundreds of tasks with online interaction. To accelerate research in this direction, we introduce a new benchmark with 200 diverse tasks spanning many domains and embodiments, each with language instructions, demonstrations, and optionally image observations. We then present \emph{Newt}, a language-conditioned multitask world model that is first pretrained on demonstrations to acquire task-aware representations and action priors, and then jointly optimized with online interaction across all tasks. Experiments show that Newt yields better multitask performance and data-efficiency than a set of strong baselines, exhibits strong open-loop control, and enables rapid adaptation to unseen tasks. We release our environments, demonstrations, code for training and evaluation, as well as 200+ checkpoints.

TL;DR: TVM is a flow matching generalization that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling by modeling transitions between diffusion timesteps and regularizing terminal behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve state-of-the-art performance in one- and few-step generative modeling from scratch, overcoming limitations of traditional flow matching and enabling efficient training with transformers.

Method: Terminal Velocity Matching models transitions between diffusion timesteps with terminal regularization, introduces architectural changes for stable training, and develops fused attention kernels for efficient Jacobian-Vector Product backward passes.

Result: Achieves 3.29 FID with 1 NFE and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs on ImageNet-256x256; 4.32 FID with 1 NFE and 2.94 FID with 4 NFEs on ImageNet-512x512, setting new SOTA for one/few-step models.

Conclusion: TVM provides an effective framework for high-fidelity few-step generative modeling with theoretical guarantees and practical efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose Terminal Velocity Matching (TVM), a generalization of flow matching that enables high-fidelity one- and few-step generative modeling. TVM models the transition between any two diffusion timesteps and regularizes its behavior at its terminal time rather than at the initial time. We prove that TVM provides an upper bound on the $2$-Wasserstein distance between data and model distributions when the model is Lipschitz continuous. However, since Diffusion Transformers lack this property, we introduce minimal architectural changes that achieve stable, single-stage training. To make TVM efficient in practice, we develop a fused attention kernel that supports backward passes on Jacobian-Vector Products, which scale well with transformer architectures. On ImageNet-256x256, TVM achieves 3.29 FID with a single function evaluation (NFE) and 1.99 FID with 4 NFEs. It similarly achieves 4.32 1-NFE FID and 2.94 4-NFE FID on ImageNet-512x512, representing state-of-the-art performance for one/few-step models from scratch.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparsity optimization for individual tasks ignores significant I/O overhead during frequent task switching on resource-constrained edge platforms.

Method: Decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap, then dynamically load only the small differential set of blocks needed for the next task.

Result: Achieves over 6.6X acceleration in task switching on average compared to existing sparsity methods, demonstrated on a real-world autonomous driving platform.

Conclusion: The framework effectively mitigates cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches and provides superior switching efficiency for multi-task scenarios.

Abstract: Sparsity is essential for deploying large models on resource constrained edge platforms. However, optimizing sparsity patterns for individual tasks in isolation ignores the significant I/O overhead incurred during frequent task switching. We introduce an on-demand multi-task sparsity framework specifically designed to minimize switching costs by maximizing parameter reuse. Unlike monolithic approaches, we decompose weights into reusable block-granular units and align sparse structures across tasks to maximize overlap. By dynamically loading only the small differential set of blocks required for the next task, our method effectively mitigates the cold-start latency inherent in traditional monolithic approaches.Experiments on a real-world autonomous driving platform demonstrate that our framework achieves superior switching efficiency, accelerating task switching by over 6.6X on average compared to existing sparsity methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether general-purpose time-series foundation models can effectively forecast Leaf Area Index (LAI) in agricultural monitoring without task-specific training.

Method: Systematic comparison using HiQ dataset (2000-2022) with statistical baselines, supervised LSTM, and Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols in zero-shot setting.

Result: Sundial outperforms fully trained LSTM when input context window covers more than one or two full seasonal cycles, demonstrating zero-shot forecasting capability.

Conclusion: Pretrained time-series foundation models have strong potential as plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications without task-specific tuning.

Abstract: This work investigates the zero-shot forecasting capability of time-series foundation models for Leaf Area Index (LAI) forecasting in agricultural monitoring. Using the HiQ dataset (U.S., 2000-2022), we systematically compare statistical baselines, a fully supervised LSTM, and the Sundial foundation model under multiple evaluation protocols. We find that Sundial, in the zero-shot setting, can outperform a fully trained LSTM provided that the input context window is sufficiently long-specifically, when covering more than one or two full seasonal cycles. This demonstrates, for the first time, that a general-purpose foundation model can surpass specialized supervised models on remote-sensing time series prediction without any task-specific tuning. These results highlight the strong potential of pretrained time-series foundation models to serve as effective plug-and-play forecasters in agricultural and environmental applications.

TL;DR: The paper reveals non-uniform memorization in latent diffusion models, identifies dimensions most responsible for memorization, and improves membership inference attacks by focusing on high-contribution dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous model inversion studies focused on data domain diffusion models, ignoring the encoder/decoder pair and latent codes in latent space generative models like LDMs.

Method: Introduced a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization.

Result: Removing less-memorizing dimensions improved membership inference attack performance with 2.7% average AUROC gains and 6.42% increase in TPR@1%FPR across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: The auto-encoder geometry significantly influences LDM memorization, providing new perspective for analyzing privacy risks in diffusion-based generative models.

Abstract: The recovery of training data from generative models (``model inversion'') has been extensively studied for diffusion models in the data domain. The encoder/decoder pair and corresponding latent codes have largely been ignored by inversion techniques applied to latent space generative models, e.g., Latent Diffusion models (LDMs). In this work we describe two key findings: (1) The diffusion model exhibits non-uniform memorization across latent codes, tending to overfit samples located in high-distortion regions of the decoder pullback metric. (2) Even within a single latent code, different dimensions contribute unequally to memorization. We introduce a principled method to rank latent dimensions by their per-dimensional contribution to the decoder pullback metric, identifying those most responsible for memorization. Empirically, removing less-memorizing dimensions when computing attack statistics for score-based membership inference attacker significantly improves performance, with average AUROC gains of 2.7\% and substantial increases in TPR@1\%FPR (6.42\%) across diverse datasets including CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet-1K, Pokémon, MS-COCO, and Flickr. This indicates stronger confidence in identifying members under extremely low false-positive tolerance. Our results highlight the overlooked influence of the auto-encoder geometry on LDM memorization and provide a new perspective for analyzing privacy risks in diffusion-based generative models.

### [242] [Optimization of Sums of Bivariate Functions: An Introduction to Relaxation-Based Methods for the Case of Finite Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20607)
*Nils Müller*

Main category: math.OC

TL;DR: The paper analyzes optimization of functions that are sums of bivariates (functions with only 2 of n arguments) on finite domains, showing NP-equivalence and existence of free lunch. It develops tractable relaxations using measure extensions, ℓ²-approximation, and entropy-regularization solvable via linear programming and coordinate ascent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the complexity and develop efficient optimization methods for functions that can be decomposed as sums of bivariate components, which appear in various applications like vertex coloring and signal reconstruction.

Method: Uses measure-valued extensions (relaxations) of objective functions, ℓ²-approximation, and entropy-regularization to derive tractable formulations solvable with linear programming, coordinate ascent, and closed-form solutions.

Result: Shows NP-equivalence of optimizing sums of bivariates and existence of free lunch. Develops several tractable algorithms and investigates limits of such relaxations using measure reconstruction from bivariate marginals.

Conclusion: The approach provides insights into different function classes that can be modeled as sums of bivariates, with applications demonstrating effectiveness on random functions, vertex coloring, and signal reconstruction problems.

Abstract: We study the optimization of functions with $n>2$ arguments that have a representation as a sum of several functions that have only $2$ of the $n$ arguments each, termed sums of bivariates, on finite domains. The complexity of optimizing sums of bivariates is shown to be NP-equivalent and it is shown that there exists free lunch in the optimization of sums of bivariates. Based on measure-valued extensions of the objective function, so-called relaxations, $\ell^2$-approximation, and entropy-regularization, we derive several tractable problem formulations solvable with linear programming, coordinate ascent as well as with closed-form solutions. The limits of applying tractable versions of such relaxations to sums of bivariates are investigated using general results for reconstructing measures from their bivariate marginals. Experiments in which the derived algorithms are applied to random functions, vertex coloring, and signal reconstruction problems provide insights into qualitatively different function classes that can be modeled as sums of bivariates.

*Can Lei,Hayat Rajani,Nuno Gracias,Rafael Garcia,Huigang Wang*

Main category: physics.ao-ph

TL;DR: PhysDNet is a physics-guided network that decomposes side-scan sonar images into seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and propagation loss components using self-supervised learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Side-scan sonar imagery suffers from view-dependent intensity variations due to entangled seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss, reducing robustness for downstream analysis.

Method: A multi-branch network that embeds the Lambertian reflection model to decouple sonar images into three interpretable fields and reconstructs intensity for self-supervised training without ground-truth annotations.

Result: The decomposed representations preserve stable geological structures, capture physically consistent illumination and attenuation, and produce reliable shadow maps.

Conclusion: Physics-guided decomposition provides a stable and interpretable domain for side-scan sonar analysis, improving physical consistency and downstream tasks like registration and shadow interpretation.

Abstract: Side-scan sonar (SSS) imagery is widely used for seafloor mapping and underwater remote sensing, yet the measured intensity is strongly influenced by seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and acoustic path loss. This entanglement makes the imagery highly view-dependent and reduces the robustness of downstream analysis. In this letter, we present PhysDNet, a physics-guided multi-branch network that decouples SSS images into three interpretable fields: seabed reflectivity, terrain elevation, and propagation loss. By embedding the Lambertian reflection model, PhysDNet reconstructs sonar intensity from these components, enabling self-supervised training without ground-truth annotations. Experiments show that the decomposed representations preserve stable geological structures, capture physically consistent illumination and attenuation, and produce reliable shadow maps. These findings demonstrate that physics-guided decomposition provides a stable and interpretable domain for SSS analysis, improving both physical consistency and downstream tasks such as registration and shadow interpretation.

TL;DR: DKAN is a dual-path knowledge-augmented network that predicts spatial gene expression from histopathology images by integrating biological knowledge and using contrastive learning, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current spatial transcriptomics methods are expensive and have limitations including under-utilization of biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and poor alignment of heterogeneous data modalities.

Method: Proposes DKAN with three key components: gene semantic representation using external databases, unified contrastive-supervised learning without exemplars, and dual-path contrastive alignment using gene semantics as cross-modal coordinators.

Result: DKAN achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art models across three public ST datasets, establishing new benchmarks for spatial gene expression prediction.

Conclusion: DKAN provides an effective tool for spatial gene expression prediction that advances biological and clinical research by addressing key limitations of existing methods.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.

TL;DR: MTMC is a hierarchical framework that decouples optimization strategy from implementation details for GPU kernel generation, using reinforcement learning for high-level strategy and LLMs for incremental implementation, achieving superior accuracy and performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches for GPU kernel generation suffer from correctness and efficiency limitations because they directly generate entire optimized programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space of optimization policies and implementation codes.

Method: Proposes Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC) - a hierarchical framework where Macro Thinking uses reinforcement learning to guide LLMs in learning semantic optimization strategies, and Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement stepwise optimization proposals.

Result: On KernelBench: achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3 (over 50% better than SOTA), up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On TritonBench: attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.

Conclusion: MTMC effectively navigates the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs to generate high-performance GPU kernels with superior accuracy and running time compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Developing high-performance GPU kernels is critical for AI and scientific computing, but remains challenging due to its reliance on expert crafting and poor portability. While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.

*Mohammed Talha Alam,Nada Saadi,Fahad Shamshad,Nils Lukas,Karthik Nandakumar,Fahkri Karray,Samuele Poppi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: Safety alignment in text-to-image diffusion models often fails under benign downstream fine-tuning, prompting the creation of SPQR benchmark to evaluate safety preservation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety alignment methods are not tested for robustness under routine post-deployment fine-tuning like LoRA personalization, leading to frequent safety breakdowns.

Method: Introduces SPQR benchmark - a single-scored metric evaluating safety, prompt adherence, quality, and robustness under benign fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates that current safety alignment frequently breaks down after benign fine-tuning, with multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses revealing failure points.

Conclusion: SPQR provides a standardized, reproducible framework to comprehensively evaluate T2I safety alignment techniques and their robustness to post-deployment adaptations.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can emit copyrighted, unsafe, or private content. Safety alignment aims to suppress specific concepts, yet evaluations seldom test whether safety persists under benign downstream fine-tuning routinely applied after deployment (e.g., LoRA personalization, style/domain adapters). We study the stability of current safety methods under benign fine-tuning and observe frequent breakdowns. As true safety alignment must withstand even benign post-deployment adaptations, we introduce the SPQR benchmark (Safety-Prompt adherence-Quality-Robustness). SPQR is a single-scored metric that provides a standardized and reproducible framework to evaluate how well safety-aligned diffusion models preserve safety, utility, and robustness under benign fine-tuning, by reporting a single leaderboard score to facilitate comparisons. We conduct multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses, along with category-wise breakdowns, to identify when safety alignment fails after benign fine-tuning, ultimately showcasing SPQR as a concise yet comprehensive benchmark for T2I safety alignment techniques for T2I models.

### [247] [Frequency Bias Matters: Diving into Robust and Generalized Deep Image Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19886)
*Chi Liu,Tianqing Zhu,Wanlei Zhou,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: The paper analyzes deep image forgery detection from a frequency perspective, identifying frequency bias as the root cause of generalization and robustness issues, and proposes a two-step frequency alignment method that serves as both an attack and defense mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep image forgery powered by AI generative models poses security challenges, with generalizability and robustness being critical concerns for forgery detectors. The root causes of these problems are not fully explored, and there's no universal method that addresses both forensic and anti-forensic aspects simultaneously.

Method: The paper provides a frequency perspective analysis revealing frequency bias as the cause of issues, then proposes a two-step frequency alignment method to remove frequency discrepancy between real and fake images. This method serves dual purposes: as a black-box attack against detectors or as universal defense to improve detector reliability.

Result: The effectiveness of the frequency alignment method is demonstrated through extensive experiments involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics across various settings, showing its utility in both attack and defense contexts.

Conclusion: Frequency bias in DNN forgery detectors is identified as the fundamental cause of generalization and robustness problems, and the proposed frequency alignment method provides a universal solution that benefits both forensic and anti-forensic applications.

Abstract: As deep image forgery powered by AI generative models, such as GANs, continues to challenge today's digital world, detecting AI-generated forgeries has become a vital security topic. Generalizability and robustness are two critical concerns of a forgery detector, determining its reliability when facing unknown GANs and noisy samples in an open world. Although many studies focus on improving these two properties, the root causes of these problems have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if there is a connection between them. Moreover, despite recent achievements in addressing these issues from image forensic or anti-forensic aspects, a universal method that can contribute to both sides simultaneously remains practically significant yet unavailable. In this paper, we provide a fundamental explanation of these problems from a frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that the frequency bias of a DNN forgery detector is a possible cause of generalization and robustness issues. Based on this finding, we propose a two-step frequency alignment method to remove the frequency discrepancy between real and fake images, offering double-sided benefits: it can serve as a strong black-box attack against forgery detectors in the anti-forensic context or, conversely, as a universal defense to improve detector reliability in the forensic context. We also develop corresponding attack and defense implementations and demonstrate their effectiveness, as well as the effect of the frequency alignment method, in various experimental settings involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics.

TL;DR: A novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection that augments audio language models with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at timestamp level, outperforming previous methods on DAIC-WoZ dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder, and while multi-modal data and LLMs show promise for AI-assisted assessment, conventional LLMs are text-centric and cannot process critical non-verbal cues from audio and visual modalities needed for mental health evaluation.

Method: Proposed framework augments audio language model with visual understanding and performs fine-grained audio-visual feature alignment at timestamp level to model temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing data and computational requirements.

Result: Experiments on DAIC-WoZ dataset show the model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods for depression detection.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates improved depression detection performance and can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, enabling broader clinical applications beyond mental health.

Abstract: Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders globally. In recent years, multi-modal data, such as speech, video, and transcripts, has been increasingly used to develop AI-assisted depression assessment systems. Large language models have further advanced this field due to their strong language understanding and generalization capabilities. However, conventional LLMs remain text-centric and cannot process the rich non-verbal cues found in audio and visual modalities, which are critical components in mental health evaluation. While multi-modal LLMs offer a promising direction, few are tailored for psychological applications. In this study, we propose a novel multi-modal LLM framework for depression detection. Our approach augments an audio language model with visual understanding and aligns audio-visual features at the timestamp level. This fine-grained alignment improves modeling of temporal dynamics across modalities while reducing the need for extensive training data and computational resources. Experiments on the DAIC-WoZ dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms both single-modality approaches and previous multi-modal methods. Moreover, the proposed framework can be extended to incorporate additional physiological signals, paving the way for broader clinical applications beyond mental health.

*Simin Zhu,Satish Ravindran,Alexander Yarovoy,Francesco Fioranelli*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A neural network approach that simultaneously segments static/moving objects from radar point clouds and estimates ego-motion velocity using simple MLPs and RNNs, without requiring intermediate signal processing steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar segmentation typically focuses on category labels, but determining object motion state is fundamental for automotive perception tasks. Existing methods don't address simultaneous static/moving object segmentation with ego-motion estimation.

Method: Uses multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for feature extraction from raw radar point clouds, performing dual tasks without cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, or motion compensation.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of extracting required information directly from unprocessed point clouds. Performs well on both segmentation and ego-motion estimation tasks using the RadarScenes dataset with novel evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed method is the first of its kind, shows strong performance on dual tasks, and has broad application potential in radar perception tasks beyond the current scope.

Abstract: Conventional radar segmentation research has typically focused on learning category labels for different moving objects. Although fundamental differences between radar and optical sensors lead to differences in the reliability of predicting accurate and consistent category labels, a review of common radar perception tasks in automotive reveals that determining whether an object is moving or static is a prerequisite for most tasks. To fill this gap, this study proposes a neural network based solution that can simultaneously segment static and moving objects from radar point clouds. Furthermore, since the measured radial velocity of static objects is correlated with the motion of the radar, this approach can also estimate the instantaneous 2D velocity of the moving platform or vehicle (ego motion). However, despite performing dual tasks, the proposed method employs very simple yet effective building blocks for feature extraction: multi layer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In addition to being the first of its kind in the literature, the proposed method also demonstrates the feasibility of extracting the information required for the dual task directly from unprocessed point clouds, without the need for cloud aggregation, Doppler compensation, motion compensation, or any other intermediate signal processing steps. To measure its performance, this study introduces a set of novel evaluation metrics and tests the proposed method using a challenging real world radar dataset, RadarScenes. The results show that the proposed method not only performs well on the dual tasks, but also has broad application potential in other radar perception tasks.

### [250] [Not Quite Anything: Overcoming SAMs Limitations for 3D Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19471)
*Keith Moore*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: A compositional approach that uses foundation segmentation models (SAM-2) as additional input channels alongside MRI scans, with prompts generated by a lightweight 3D U-Net, achieving 96% accuracy for basal ganglia segmentation without modifying foundation model weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation segmentation models like SAM and SAM-2 perform poorly on brain MRIs where structures lack sharp boundaries and have low contrast, making direct application challenging for medical imaging tasks.

Method: Treat foundation model output as additional input channel alongside MRI; generate SAM-2 prompts using pre-trained lightweight 3D U-Net; smooth edges of foundation model guesses; also test prompt-free segmentation using DINO attention maps in the same framework.

Result: Achieves about 96% volume accuracy on basal ganglia segmentation, which is sufficient for studying longitudinal volume change; approach is fast, label efficient, and robust to out-of-distribution scans.

Conclusion: The compositional architecture avoids modifying foundation weights and adapts to domain shift without retraining foundation models, successfully applied to study inflammation-linked changes in sudden onset pediatric OCD.

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models such as SAM and SAM-2 perform well on natural images but struggle with brain MRIs where structures like the caudate and thalamus lack sharp boundaries and have low contrast. Rather than fine tune these models (for example MedSAM), we propose a compositional alternative where the foundation model output is treated as an additional input channel and passed alongside the MRI to highlight regions of interest.
  We generate SAM-2 prompts by using a lightweight 3D U-Net that was previously trained on MRI segmentation. The U-Net may have been trained on a different dataset, so its guesses are often imprecise but usually in the correct region. The edges of the resulting foundation model guesses are smoothed to improve alignment with the MRI. We also test prompt free segmentation using DINO attention maps in the same framework.
  This has-a architecture avoids modifying foundation weights and adapts to domain shift without retraining the foundation model. It reaches about 96 percent volume accuracy on basal ganglia segmentation, which is sufficient for our study of longitudinal volume change. The approach is fast, label efficient, and robust to out of distribution scans. We apply it to study inflammation linked changes in sudden onset pediatric OCD.

TL;DR: A multi-stage deep learning framework using multi-phase CT scans for non-invasive diagnosis of pediatric liver tumors, achieving high accuracy in detecting and classifying benign vs malignant tumors and their subtypes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current biopsy methods for pediatric liver tumors are invasive, risky due to vascularity and fragile tissue, require anesthesia for young children, and cause psychological trauma. AI solutions for this specific pediatric application are lacking.

Method: Multi-stage DL framework with: 1) PKCP-MixUp data augmentation for data scarcity/class imbalance, 2) Tumor detection model to extract ROIs, 3) Two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones using ROI-masked images from multi-phase CT scans.

Result: Tumor detection achieved mAP=0.871; benign vs malignant classification reached AUC=0.989; benign subtype classification AUC=0.915; malignant subtype classification AUC=0.979. Framework demonstrated robustness through ablation studies and interpretability analyses.

Conclusion: The framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides insights for CT phase selection and model design, and enables precise, accessible non-invasive diagnosis of pediatric liver tumors.

Abstract: Pediatric liver tumors are one of the most common solid tumors in pediatrics, with differentiation of benign or malignant status and pathological classification critical for clinical treatment. While pathological examination is the gold standard, the invasive biopsy has notable limitations: the highly vascular pediatric liver and fragile tumor tissue raise complication risks such as bleeding; additionally, young children with poor compliance require anesthesia for biopsy, increasing medical costs or psychological trauma. Although many efforts have been made to utilize AI in clinical settings, most researchers have overlooked its importance in pediatric liver tumors. To establish a non-invasive examination procedure, we developed a multi-stage deep learning (DL) framework for automated pediatric liver tumor diagnosis using multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT. Two retrospective and prospective cohorts were enrolled. We established a novel PKCP-MixUp data augmentation method to address data scarcity and class imbalance. We also trained a tumor detection model to extract ROIs, and then set a two-stage diagnosis pipeline with three backbones with ROI-masked images. Our tumor detection model has achieved high performance (mAP=0.871), and the first stage classification model between benign and malignant tumors reached an excellent performance (AUC=0.989). Final diagnosis models also exhibited robustness, including benign subtype classification (AUC=0.915) and malignant subtype classification (AUC=0.979). We also conducted multi-level comparative analyses, such as ablation studies on data and training pipelines, as well as Shapley-Value and CAM interpretability analyses. This framework fills the pediatric-specific DL diagnostic gap, provides actionable insights for CT phase selection and model design, and paves the way for precise, accessible pediatric liver tumor diagnosis.

*Adele Myers,Nina Miolane*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: The paper presents the selective disk bispectrum, a fast, rotation-invariant representation for image shape analysis that enables faithful shape recovery and multi-reference alignment for rotated images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a rotation-invariant representation of images that retains all shape information while disregarding object orientation, which is valuable for computer vision and shape analysis tasks where orientation should not affect learning.

Method: Derived an explicit inverse for the disk bispectrum and defined a 'selective' disk bispectrum that uses only the minimal number of coefficients needed for faithful shape recovery, overcoming previous limitations of cubic complexity and lack of invertibility.

Result: The selective disk bispectrum enables multi-reference alignment for rotated images, a task previously intractable for disk bispectrum methods, and provides a computationally efficient representation for large datasets.

Conclusion: The disk bispectrum is established as a practical and theoretically grounded tool for learning on rotation-invariant shape data, with invertibility and computational efficiency making it suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: In many computer vision and shape analysis tasks, practitioners are interested in learning from the shape of the object in an image, while disregarding the object's orientation. To this end, it is valuable to define a rotation-invariant representation of images, retaining all information about that image, but disregarding the way an object is rotated in the frame. To be practical for learning tasks, this representation must be computationally efficient for large datasets and invertible, so the representation can be visualized in image space. To this end, we present the selective disk bispectrum: a fast, rotation-invariant representation for image shape analysis. While the translational bispectrum has long been used as a translational invariant representation for 1-D and 2-D signals, its extension to 2-D (disk) rotational invariance on images has been hindered by the absence of an invertible formulation and its cubic complexity. In this work, we derive an explicit inverse for the disk bispectrum, which allows us to define a "selective" disk bispectrum, which only uses the minimal number of coefficients needed for faithful shape recovery. We show that this representation enables multi-reference alignment for rotated images-a task previously intractable for disk bispectrum methods. These results establish the disk bispectrum as a practical and theoretically grounded tool for learning on rotation-invariant shape data.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: DLADiff is a dual-layer defense system that protects facial privacy against both fine-tuning and zero-shot diffusion model attacks, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in existing defenses that focus only on fine-tuning attacks while ignoring zero-shot generation threats to facial privacy.

Method: Uses dual-layer protection: Layer 1 employs Dual-Surrogate Models and Alternating Dynamic Fine-Tuning with adversarial training; Layer 2 provides simple but effective zero-shot defense.

Result: Significantly outperforms existing approaches in defending against fine-tuning and achieves unprecedented performance against zero-shot generation.

Conclusion: DLADiff effectively addresses the complete threat landscape of diffusion model customization attacks on facial privacy.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion models, a variety of fine-tuning methods have been developed, enabling high-fidelity image generation with high similarity to the target content using only 3 to 5 training images. More recently, zero-shot generation methods have emerged, capable of producing highly realistic outputs from a single reference image without altering model weights. However, technological advancements have also introduced significant risks to facial privacy. Malicious actors can exploit diffusion model customization with just a few or even one image of a person to create synthetic identities nearly identical to the original identity. Although research has begun to focus on defending against diffusion model customization, most existing defense methods target fine-tuning approaches and neglect zero-shot generation defenses. To address this issue, this paper proposes Dual-Layer Anti-Diffusion (DLADiff) to defense both fine-tuning methods and zero-shot methods. DLADiff contains a dual-layer protective mechanism. The first layer provides effective protection against unauthorized fine-tuning by leveraging the proposed Dual-Surrogate Models (DSUR) mechanism and Alternating Dynamic Fine-Tuning (ADFT), which integrates adversarial training with the prior knowledge derived from pre-fine-tuned models. The second layer, though simple in design, demonstrates strong effectiveness in preventing image generation through zero-shot methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in defending against fine-tuning of diffusion models and achieves unprecedented performance in protecting against zero-shot generation.

Three orthodontists (Os) and three general dental practitioners (GDPs) classified the position of unerupted maxillary canines on 306 radiographs (T0) according to the three different sector classification systems (5-, 4-, and 3-sector classification system). The assessment was repeated after four weeks (T1). Intra- and inter-observer agreement were evaluated with Cohen's K and Fleiss K, and between group differences with a z-test. The same radiographs were tested on different artificial intelligence (AI) models, pre-trained on an extended dataset of 1,222 radiographs. The best-performing model was identified based on its sensitivity and precision. Results. The 3-sector system was found to be the classification method with highest reproducibility, with an agreement (Cohen's K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.80 to 0.92, and an overall agreement of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.83-0.87]. The overall inter-observer agreement (Fleiss K) ranged from 0.69 to 0.7. The educational background did not affect either intra- or inter-observer agreement (p>0.05). DenseNet121 proved to be the best-performing model in allocating impacted canines in the three different classes, with an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Conclusion. AI models can be designed to automatically classify the position of unerupted maxillary canines.

TL;DR: FaraGen system generates synthetic data for computer use agents, training Fara-7B model that outperforms comparable CUAs and competes with larger models using only screenshots and coordinate-based actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Progress in computer use agents is constrained by lack of large, high-quality datasets capturing human-computer interactions, unlike the abundant textual data available for LLMs.

Method: FaraGen system proposes diverse web tasks, generates multiple solution attempts, and filters successful trajectories using multiple verifiers to create synthetic data at approximately $1 per trajectory. This data trains Fara-7B, a native CUA model that uses screenshots for perception and coordinate-based action execution.

Result: Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench benchmarks, and is competitive with much larger frontier models. The system achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks.

Conclusion: Scalable synthetic data generation systems like FaraGen are crucial for advancing small, efficient agentic models, demonstrating that high-quality synthetic data can enable competitive performance without requiring massive model sizes.

Abstract: Progress in computer use agents (CUAs) has been constrained by the absence of large and high-quality datasets that capture how humans interact with a computer. While LLMs have thrived on abundant textual data, no comparable corpus exists for CUA trajectories. To address these gaps, we introduce FaraGen, a novel synthetic data generation system for multi-step web tasks. FaraGen can propose diverse tasks from frequently used websites, generate multiple solution attempts, and filter successful trajectories using multiple verifiers. It achieves high throughput, yield, and diversity for multi-step web tasks, producing verified trajectories at approximately $1 each. We use this data to train Fara-7B, a native CUA model that perceives the computer using only screenshots, executes actions via predicted coordinates, and is small enough to run on-device. We find that Fara-7B outperforms other CUA models of comparable size on benchmarks like WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench -- our novel benchmark that better captures under-represented web tasks in pre-existing benchmarks. Furthermore, Fara-7B is competitive with much larger frontier models, illustrating key benefits of scalable data generation systems in advancing small efficient agentic models. We are making Fara-7B open-weight on Microsoft Foundry and HuggingFace, and we are releasing WebTailBench.

TL;DR: VISTA-Gym is a scalable training environment that enables visual agentic reinforcement learning to enhance VLMs' tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities, with VISTA-R1-8B outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 9.51%-18.72%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models have strong image understanding but limited ability for multi-step visual reasoning and tool integration, struggling with tool selection, invocation, and coordination.

Method: VISTA-Gym unifies diverse multimodal reasoning tasks with standardized visual tool interfaces, executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback, and trajectory logging. VISTA-R1 is trained via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning.

Result: VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72% across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: VISTA-Gym serves as an effective training ground to unlock tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for vision-language models, demonstrating significant performance improvements in visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong image understanding, their ability to "think with images", i.e., to reason through multi-step visual interactions, remains limited. We introduce VISTA-Gym, a scalable training environment for incentivizing tool-integrated visual reasoning capabilities in VLMs. VISTA-Gym unifies diverse real-world multimodal reasoning tasks (7 tasks from 13 datasets in total) with a standardized interface for visual tools (e.g., grounding, parsing), executable interaction loops, verifiable feedback signals, and efficient trajectory logging, enabling visual agentic reinforcement learning at scale. While recent VLMs exhibit strong text-only reasoning, both proprietary and open-source models still struggle with tool selection, invocation, and coordination. With VISTA-Gym, we train VISTA-R1 to interleave tool-use with agentic reasoning via multi-turn trajectory sampling and end-to-end reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments across 11 public reasoning-intensive VQA benchmarks show that VISTA-R1-8B outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with similar sizes by 9.51%-18.72%, demonstrating VISTA-Gym as an effective training ground to unlock the tool-integrated reasoning capabilities for VLMs.

TL;DR: CostNav is the first micro-navigation economic testbed that evaluates autonomous delivery robots through cost-revenue analysis, revealing that optimizing for task success differs from optimizing for economic viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing navigation benchmarks focus only on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability, which is critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots.

Method: CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. It projects from reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries.

Result: The baseline achieves 43.0% SLA compliance but is not commercially viable, yielding a loss of $30.009 per run with no finite break-even point. Operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance (99.7% of per-run costs).

Conclusion: CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms and highlighting collision avoidance as a key optimization target.

Abstract: Existing navigation benchmarks focus on task success metrics while overlooking economic viability -- critical for commercial deployment of autonomous delivery robots. We introduce \emph{CostNav}, a \textbf{Micro-Navigation Economic Testbed} that evaluates embodied agents through comprehensive cost-revenue analysis aligned with real-world business operations. CostNav models the complete economic lifecycle including hardware, training, energy, maintenance costs, and delivery revenue with service-level agreements, using industry-derived parameters. \textbf{To our knowledge, CostNav is the first work to quantitatively expose the gap between navigation research metrics and commercial viability}, revealing that optimizing for task success fundamentally differs from optimizing for economic deployment. Our cost model uses parameters derived from industry data sources (energy rates, delivery service pricing), and we project from a reduced-scale simulation to realistic deliveries. Under this projection, the baseline achieves 43.0\% SLA compliance but is \emph{not} commercially viable: yielding a loss of \$30.009 per run with no finite break-even point, because operating costs are dominated by collision-induced maintenance, which accounts for 99.7\% of per-run costs and highlights collision avoidance as a key optimization target. We demonstrate a learning-based on-device navigation baseline and establish a foundation for evaluating rule-based navigation, imitation learning, and cost-aware RL training. CostNav bridges the gap between navigation research and commercial deployment, enabling data-driven decisions about economic trade-offs across navigation paradigms.

*Bo Pang,Chenxi Xu,Jierui Ren,Guoping Wang,Sheng Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VibraVerse is a large-scale dataset bridging 3D geometry and acoustic signals through physical properties and modal analysis, enabling physically consistent multimodal learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal frameworks lack physical consistency and overlook causal relationships between object geometry, material properties, and sound production, limiting understanding of the physical world.

Method: Created VibraVerse dataset with explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, computed modal parameters for impact sound synthesis, and developed CLASP contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Models trained on VibraVerse show superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning tasks.

Conclusion: VibraVerse establishes a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and deeper understanding of physical world.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world requires perceptual models grounded in physical laws rather than mere statistical correlations. However, existing multimodal learning frameworks, focused on vision and language, lack physical consistency and overlook the intrinsic causal relationships among an object's geometry, material, vibration modes, and the sounds it produces. We introduce VibraVerse, a large-scale geometry-acoustics alignment dataset that explicitly bridges the causal chain from 3D geometry -> physical attributes -> modal parameters -> acoustic signals. Each 3D model has explicit physical properties (density, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio) and volumetric geometry, from which modal eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors are computed for impact sound synthesis under controlled excitations. To establish this coherence, we introduce CLASP, a contrastive learning framework for cross-modal alignment that preserves the causal correspondence between an object's physical structure and its acoustic response. This framework enforces physically consistent alignment across modalities, ensuring that every sample is coherent, traceable to the governing equations, and embedded within a unified representation space spanning shape, image, and sound. Built upon VibraVerse, we define a suite of benchmark tasks for geometry-to-sound prediction, sound-guided shape reconstruction, and cross-modal representation learning. Extensive validations on these tasks demonstrate that models trained on VibraVerse exhibit superior accuracy, interpretability, and generalization across modalities. These results establish VibraVerse as a benchmark for physically consistent and causally interpretable multimodal learning, providing a foundation for sound-guided embodied perception and a deeper understanding of the physical world. The dataset will be open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs often produce factually inaccurate outputs due to lack of robust reasoning capabilities, and there's limited research on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in multimodal systems compared to LLMs.

Method: Leverages structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image captioning, with steps including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. Evaluates hierarchical, triple-based, and bullet-point knowledge representations.

Result: Improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on a curated dataset from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual Captions, and COCO Captions, revealing insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgeable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) are powerful generative tools but often produce factually inaccurate outputs due to a lack of robust reasoning capabilities. While extensive research has been conducted on integrating external knowledge for reasoning in large language models (LLMs), such efforts remain underexplored in VLMs, where the challenge is compounded by the need to bridge multiple modalities seamlessly. This work introduces a framework for knowledge-guided reasoning in VLMs, leveraging structured knowledge graphs for multi-hop verification using image-captioning task to illustrate our framework. Our approach enables systematic reasoning across multiple steps, including visual entity recognition, knowledge graph traversal, and fact-based caption refinement. We evaluate the framework using hierarchical, triple-based and bullet-point based knowledge representations, analyzing their effectiveness in factual accuracy and logical inference. Empirical results show that our approach improves factual accuracy by approximately 31% on preliminary experiments on a curated dataset of mixtures from Google Landmarks v2, Conceptual captions and Coco captions revealing key insights into reasoning patterns and failure modes. This work demonstrates the potential of integrating external knowledge for advancing reasoning in VLMs, paving the way for more reliable and knowledgable multimodal systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust autonomous navigation in challenging outdoor environments with dense vegetation, irregular obstacles, and complex terrain, where traditional methods struggle to distinguish between traversable and non-traversable vegetation.

Method: Fuses segmented RGB images and LiDAR point clouds using Gaussian Splatting to construct a traversability-aware Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) that jointly encodes geometry and semantics, updated online for real-time operation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods with over 50% higher success rate, 40% fewer freezing incidents, 5% shorter paths, and up to 13% faster time to goal, supporting long-range missions up to 100 meters on both quadruped and wheeled platforms.

Conclusion: Splatblox demonstrates effective real-time navigation in vegetation-rich outdoor environments by combining semantic reasoning with geometric perception through Gaussian Splatting, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: We present Splatblox, a real-time system for autonomous navigation in outdoor environments with dense vegetation, irregular obstacles, and complex terrain. Our method fuses segmented RGB images and LiDAR point clouds using Gaussian Splatting to construct a traversability-aware Euclidean Signed Distance Field (ESDF) that jointly encodes geometry and semantics. Updated online, this field enables semantic reasoning to distinguish traversable vegetation (e.g., tall grass) from rigid obstacles (e.g., trees), while LiDAR ensures 360-degree geometric coverage for extended planning horizons. We validate Splatblox on a quadruped robot and demonstrate transfer to a wheeled platform. In field trials across vegetation-rich scenarios, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods with over 50% higher success rate, 40% fewer freezing incidents, 5% shorter paths, and up to 13% faster time to goal, while supporting long-range missions up to 100 meters.

TL;DR: ArtiBrain: A modular framework for articulated object manipulation that combines high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control, significantly outperforming existing methods on the new ArtiBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories in interactive articulated manipulation tasks.

Method: Uses VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) for subgoal decomposition, Hybrid Controller with geometry-aware keyframe execution and affordance-guided diffusion, and Affordance Memory Bank for accumulating successful episodes.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization on the ArtiBench benchmark.

Conclusion: ArtiBrain provides an effective solution for long-horizon articulated manipulation with strong generalization capabilities across different parts and configurations.

Abstract: Interactive articulated manipulation requires long-horizon, multi-step interactions with appliances while maintaining physical consistency. Existing vision-language and diffusion-based policies struggle to generalize across parts, instances, and categories. We first introduce ArtiBench, a five-level benchmark covering kitchen, storage, office, and tool environments. ArtiBench enables structured evaluation from cross-part and cross-instance variation to long-horizon multi-object tasks, revealing the core generalization challenges of articulated object manipulation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ArtiBrain, a modular framework that unifies high-level reasoning with adaptive low-level control. ArtiBrain uses a VLM-based Task Reasoner (GPT-4.1) to decompose and validate subgoals, and employs a Hybrid Controller that combines geometry-aware keyframe execution with affordance-guided diffusion for precise and interpretable manipulation. An Affordance Memory Bank continually accumulates successful execution episodes and propagates part-level actionable affordances to unseen articulated parts and configurations. Extensive experiments on ArtiBench show that our ArtiBrain significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal and diffusion-based methods in robustness and generalization. Code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.
