Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable\nbecause class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.\nAdditionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces\nsymmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions\nwhere group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to\nencourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively\nevaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including\nagainst targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR\nsignificantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across\nruns. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover\nin this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be\nclassified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sy-FAR technique improves adversarial robustness fairness by ensuring symmetric attack success rates between classes, rather than perfect parity, making it more practical for real-world applications like face recognition.", "motivation": "Existing adversarial robustness methods create unfairness where some classes/groups are easier to attack than others. Perfect fairness is often infeasible in realistic scenarios like face recognition due to natural class similarities.", "method": "Developed Sy-FAR technique that encourages symmetry in attack success rates (attacks from class i to j should be as successful as from j to i) while optimizing adversarial robustness.", "result": "Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness across 5 datasets and 3 model architectures, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It's faster, more consistent, and reduces vulnerability of target classes that adversarial examples tend to be classified into.", "conclusion": "Symmetry is a more tractable and desirable fairness goal than perfect parity for adversarial robustness, as it naturally handles class similarities and induces group-level fairness while being practically achievable."}}
