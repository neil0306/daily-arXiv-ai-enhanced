### [1] [Contextual Augmentation for Entity Linking using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18888)
*Daniel Vollmers,Hamada M. Zahera,Diego Moussallem,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A unified entity linking approach that jointly performs entity recognition and disambiguation using fine-tuned models and LLM-enriched context, achieving SOTA performance on out-of-domain datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional two-step entity linking methods are computationally intensive and less effective, needing a more integrated approach.

Method: Fine-tuned model that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified framework, leveraging large language models to enrich entity mention context.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, particularly on out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed unified approach with LLM-enriched context effectively improves entity linking performance, especially for out-of-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified
framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich
the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared
with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

### [2] [Small Language Models Offer Significant Potential for Science Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18890)
*Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A framework using small language models (MiniLMs) for efficient information retrieval from geoscience literature, offering precise, cost-effective alternatives to large language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address concerns about information biases and computational costs of large language models while enabling rapid, precise retrieval from extensive geoscience literature.

Method: Curated corpus of 77M sentences from 95 geoscience journals (2000-2024), using MiniLMs with semantic search and sentence-level indexing for domain-specific information extraction.

Result: MiniLMs excel at identifying expert-verified information with established sources, especially quantitative findings, and enable tracking research evolution through sentiment analysis and topical clustering.

Conclusion: MiniLMs hold significant potential for geoscience applications including fact/image retrieval, trend analysis, contradiction analysis, and educational purposes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

### [3] [When Models Can't Follow: Testing Instruction Adherence Across 256 LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18892)
*Richard J. Young,Brandon Gillins,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A streamlined evaluation framework using 20 carefully designed prompts to assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories, tested on 256 verified models from major providers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic evaluation of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging, and newer models may be trained on existing benchmarks, requiring novel evaluation approaches to assess genuine capabilities rather than memorized performance.

Method: A compact test suite with 20 prompts targeting distinct aspects of instruction following (format compliance, content constraints, logical sequencing, multi-step task execution), tested on 256 verified working models from OpenRouter with methodological rigor to prevent selection bias.

Result: The framework provides comparative performance analysis across major providers and emerging implementations, revealing consistent failure modes and identifying specific instruction types that pose particular challenges.

Conclusion: This work contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the contemporary LLM landscape, offering a practical diagnostic tool that balances comprehensiveness with efficiency.

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

*Mangsura Kabir Oni,Tabia Tanzin Prama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned multilingual Transformer models outperform zero-shot LLMs for Bengali-to-Sylheti translation, with mBART-50 achieving best adequacy and MarianMT showing strongest character fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-resource languages like Sylheti remain underexplored in machine translation despite advances in neural approaches, creating a need for inclusive language technologies.

Method: Fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs) for Bengali-to-Sylheti translation.

Result: Fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with mBART-50 achieving highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing strongest character-level fidelity.

Conclusion: Task-specific adaptation is crucial for underrepresented languages, contributing to inclusive language technology development.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

### [5] [DuoLens: A Framework for Robust Detection of Machine-Generated Multilingual Text and Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18904)
*Shriyansh Agrawal,Aidan Lau,Sanyam Shah,Ahan M R,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuned encoder-only Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform Large Language Models for machine-generated content detection, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current machine-generated content detectors using zero-shot methods suffer from high computational costs or insufficient accuracy, creating a need for more efficient and accurate solutions.

Method: Fine-tuning pre-trained encoder-only SLMs (RoBERTA and CodeBERTa) using specialized datasets for binary classification of source code and natural language content.

Result: SLMs achieve AUROC = 0.97-0.99 and macro-F1 0.89-0.94 while reducing latency by 8-12× and peak VRAM by 3-5×. Performance remains robust under cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations.

Conclusion: SLMs are highly effective for machine-generated content detection, offering superior performance and efficiency compared to LLMs, with strong resilience to various transformations.

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [6] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase is a model-agnostic framework that uses LLMs to rephrase raw tweets into formal language before topic modeling, improving topic coherence, uniqueness, and diversity while reducing redundancy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional topic modeling struggles with social media short texts due to their brevity, informality, and noise, producing incoherent or redundant topics that are difficult to interpret.

Method: Developed TM-Rephrase framework using LLMs to rephrase tweets into standardized formal language. Tested two strategies (general and colloquial-to-formal) on 25,027 COVID-19 tweets with multiple topic modeling methods.

Result: TM-Rephrase improved topic coherence, uniqueness, and diversity while reducing topic redundancy across most algorithms. Colloquial-to-formal strategy performed best, especially with LDA.

Conclusion: The framework provides a model-agnostic approach to enhance topic modeling for public health social media analysis, with broader implications for understanding public discourse in health crises and other domains.

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

### [7] [Learning from the Best, Differently: A Diversity-Driven Rethinking on Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18909)
*Hongyi He,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Mingni Tang,Yi Cheng,Jintao Wang,Wenjie Li,Peng Cheng,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ODiS is a data selection algorithm that uses orthogonal dimensions to ensure both quality and diversity in LLM pre-training data, outperforming traditional score-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing score-based data selection methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored data to appear high-quality but systematically overlook diversity, leading to degraded model performance.

Method: ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, decorrelates scores via PCA, trains Roberta-based scorers for each orthogonal dimension, and selects top-scored data from each dimension to construct the training dataset.

Result: ODiS-selected data shows less than 2% inter-dimension overlap, confirming orthogonality. Models trained with ODiS data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream benchmarks.

Conclusion: Orthogonal, diversity-aware data selection is necessary for LLMs, as ODiS effectively preserves both quality and diversity in pre-training data.

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

### [8] [Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dynamic reversible pruning framework for bias mitigation in LLMs that adaptively masks context-aware neuron activations during inference, enabling real-time fairness control without permanent model changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bias mitigation methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and static - unable to adapt to changing conversational contexts. Need flexible inference-time solutions for dynamic fairness control.

Method: Proposes dynamic reversible pruning that detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking during generation, preserving knowledge while modulating harmful behaviors.

Result: Achieves fine-grained bias mitigation with preserved knowledge and coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues, enabling real-time fairness control.

Conclusion: Dynamic reversible pruning provides effective inference-time bias mitigation that adapts to conversational contexts while maintaining model coherence and knowledge preservation.

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

*Chen Chen,ZeYang Hu,Fengjiao Chen,Liya Ma,Jiaxing Liu,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes MMAO-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with 1880 samples across 44 task types to evaluate both uni-modal and omni-modal understanding in multimodal models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the unclear correlation between uni-modal and omni-modal capabilities and drive the intelligence evolution of omni models through comprehensive evaluation.

Method: Created a novel benchmark with human-curated samples, diverse task types, and innovative multi-step open-ended questions to assess complex reasoning.

Result: Revealed compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance, showing omni-modal capability acts as a bottleneck for weak models but provides synergistic promotion for strong models.

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench effectively evaluates multimodal understanding and reveals important relationships between different modal capabilities, providing insights for model development.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

### [10] [Misinformation Detection using Large Language Models with Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18918)
*Jainee Patel,Chintan Bhatt,Himani Trivedi,Thanh Thi Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper presents an explainable misinformation detection pipeline using transformer-based PLMs with a two-step fine-tuning strategy and interpretability methods (LIME and SHAP) to provide transparent detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid spread of misinformation online undermines trust and informed decision making, creating a need for effective and transparent detection methods.

Method: Uses RoBERTa and DistilBERT with a two-step fine-tuning strategy: first freezing the backbone and training the classification head, then progressively unfreezing layers with layer-wise learning rate decay. Integrates LIME for token-level explanations and SHAP for global feature attribution.

Result: DistilBERT achieves comparable accuracy to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. The approach maintains performance while providing faithful local and global justifications.

Conclusion: PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and interpretability methods provide an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy misinformation detection, showing lightweight models can maintain performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

### [11] [Evaluating LLM Story Generation through Large-scale Network Analysis of Social Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18932)
*Hiroshi Nonaka,K. E. Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A scalable method using signed character networks to evaluate LLM story generation, showing LLMs consistently create stories with tightly-knit, positive relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human assessment of LLM creativity is difficult to scale, requiring automated methods to evaluate complex creative tasks like story generation.

Method: Analyze social structures in narratives as signed character networks, comparing network properties (density, clustering, signed edge weights) across 1,200+ stories from 4 LLMs and human-written corpus.

Result: LLM-generated stories consistently show strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships, aligning with prior human assessment findings.

Conclusion: The network analysis approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and tendencies in LLM creative storytelling.

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

*Howard Yen,Ashwin Paranjape,Mengzhou Xia,Thejas Venkatesh,Jack Hessel,Danqi Chen,Yuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIM is a lightweight framework for long-horizon agentic search that separates retrieval into search/browse tools and periodically summarizes trajectories, achieving better performance with fewer tool calls than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic search frameworks struggle with long trajectories due to context limitations, accumulating noisy content, hitting context/tool budgets, and stopping early.

Method: Separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and periodically summarizes the trajectory to keep context concise while enabling longer, more focused searches.

Result: SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE with o3 base model, outperforming open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points respectively, with 4-6x fewer tool calls and fewer hallucinations.

Conclusion: SLIM provides an effective solution for long-horizon agentic search with reduced costs and improved performance, and the analysis framework can inform future long-horizon agent development.

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Motivation: Current LLM evaluation is limited to verifiable tasks like mathematics and programming, but real-world applications require assessing LLMs' ability to process professional documents, synthesize information, and generate comprehensive reports.

Method: Created ProfBench with human-expert evaluations across four professional domains, developed affordable LLM-Judges that mitigate self-enhancement bias and reduce evaluation costs by 2-3 orders of magnitude.

Result: ProfBench poses significant challenges even for state-of-the-art LLMs, with top models like GPT-5-high achieving only 65.9% overall performance. Notable disparities exist between proprietary and open-weight models.

Conclusion: The benchmark reveals the difficulty of professional-domain tasks for current LLMs and provides insights into the role of extended thinking for complex professional tasks, making fair evaluation accessible to the broader community.

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights

### [14] [Dynamic Evaluation for Oversensitivity in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19005)
*Sophia Xiao Pu,Sitao Cheng,Xin Eric Wang,William Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OVERBENCH is a dynamic benchmark framework that generates model-specific challenging datasets to address LLM oversensitivity, capturing emerging defensive patterns across 25 models with 450,000 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing static benchmarks degrade over time due to model evolution, leading to data contamination and reduced evaluative power for detecting oversensitivity in language models.

Method: Developed a framework for dynamically generating model-specific challenging datasets that capture emerging defensive patterns and align with each model's unique behavior.

Result: Constructed OVERBENCH benchmark aggregating datasets across diverse LLM families with 450,000 samples from 25 models, providing continuous monitoring of defensive triggers.

Conclusion: OVERBENCH offers a dynamic and evolving perspective on oversensitivity, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook as models advance.

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

Motivation: As LLMs are increasingly used in human-AI interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts become critical for effective and appropriate communication.

Method: Introduced SCRIPTS dataset with 1k dialogues from movie scripts in English and Korean, annotated with probabilistic relational labels by native speakers. Evaluated nine models on their ability to infer interpersonal relationships between speakers.

Result: Proprietary LLMs achieved 75-80% on English dataset but dropped to 58-69% on Korean. Models selected Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of responses. Thinking models and chain-of-thought provided minimal benefits and sometimes amplified social biases.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have significant limitations in social reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for developing socially-aware language models that can better understand interpersonal relationships across different languages and cultural contexts.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

*Abeer Badawi,Elahe Rahimi,Md Tahmid Rahman Laskar,Sheri Grach,Lindsay Bertrand,Lames Danok,Jimmy Huang,Frank Rudzicz,Elham Dolatabadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MentalBench introduces two benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in mental health support: MentalBench-100k with 100,000 response pairs from real scenarios, and MentalAlign-70k comparing LLM judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs in mental health are limited in scale, reliability, and lack frameworks to assess when automated judges can be trusted, using synthetic or social media data.

Method: Created MentalBench-100k with 10,000 conversations and LLM-generated responses, and MentalAlign-70k comparing LLM judges with human experts using Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework with ICC analysis.

Result: LLM judges show systematic inflation, strong reliability for cognitive attributes like guidance, reduced precision for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance.

Conclusion: Establishes new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable, large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health support.

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and

### [18] [From Memorization to Generalization: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Biomedical Term-to-Identifier Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19036)
*Suswitha Pericharla,Daniel B. Hier,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Fine-tuning LLMs for biomedical term normalization shows varying success depending on terminology characteristics - gene/protein mappings benefit most while GO and HPO show limited improvement due to non-lexicalized identifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models perform unevenly across different biomedical terminologies for automated term normalization, which is crucial for semantic interoperability in biomedical data integration.

Method: Evaluated fine-tuning of Llama 3.1 8B across multiple biomedical ontologies (GO, HPO, GENE), analyzing both memorization (training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance), and conducted embedding analyses to examine semantic alignment.

Result: GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (77% improvement) but HPO showed minimal improvement. Generalization only occurred for GENE mappings (13.9% gain). Baseline accuracy varied by model scale with GPT-4o outperforming Llama variants. Embedding analyses revealed tight semantic alignment for gene symbols but weak alignment for GO/HPO.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning success depends on identifier popularity (enhancing memorization) and lexicalization (enabling generalization). Arbitrary identifiers in GO and HPO constrain models to rote learning, providing a predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when it fails.

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper studies how LLMs handle conflicts between their internal knowledge and contradictory prompt information, extending this investigation to code generation with a new framework and evaluation method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand LLM behavior when parametric knowledge conflicts with prompt information, particularly in code generation scenarios where prior research was limited.

Method: Proposed a domain-agnostic framework for constructing knowledge conflicts, developed a novel evaluation method and dataset for code conflict scenarios, and used activation-level steering experiments.

Result: Large LLMs encode knowledge conflicts with 80.65% detection accuracy; activation steering achieved 12.6% improvement over random baseline, but effectiveness depends on model size, task domain, and steering direction.

Conclusion: LLMs can detect knowledge conflicts, and steering can improve performance, but optimal results require careful balancing of model characteristics and task parameters.

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

### [20] [A Graph Signal Processing Framework for Hallucination Detection in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19117)
*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A spectral analysis framework using graph signal processing on transformer attention graphs can detect hallucinations in LLMs with 88.75% accuracy, outperforming perplexity-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distinguishing factual reasoning from hallucinations in large language models remains challenging despite their impressive performance.

Method: Model transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by attention, with token embeddings as signals. Use graph signal processing to define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios.

Result: Universal spectral patterns emerge: factual statements show consistent "energy mountain" behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types have distinct signatures. A simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy vs 75% for perplexity baselines.

Conclusion: Spectral geometry captures reasoning patterns and error behaviors, offering a promising framework for hallucination detection in large language models.

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

*Valentin Noël*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Transformer architectures develop unique computational fingerprints detectable through spectral analysis of attention graphs, revealing how training emphasis creates measurable connectivity patterns during linguistic computations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic computations through distinct connectivity patterns, and to develop a method for detecting these architectural signatures.

Method: Used graph signal processing on attention-induced token graphs to track changes in algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value) under voice alternation across 20 languages and three model families, focusing on early layers (2-5).

Result: Clear architectural signatures emerged: Phi-3-Mini showed dramatic English-specific early layer disruption, Qwen2.5-7B displayed small distributed shifts largest for morphologically rich languages, and LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibited systematic but muted responses. Spectral signatures correlated strongly with behavioral differences and were modulated by attention head ablations.

Conclusion: Training emphasis leaves detectable computational imprints as specialized processing strategies that manifest as measurable connectivity patterns. The framework serves as a simple, training-free diagnostic for revealing architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tibetan is a major low-resource language with unique linguistic characteristics that has received limited AI research attention due to lack of accessible data, benchmarks, and tools.

Method: Systematic categorization of existing datasets and tools, evaluation of methods across different tasks, and performance comparison where possible.

Result: Identified persistent bottlenecks including data sparsity, orthographic variation, and lack of unified evaluation metrics, while highlighting the potential of cross-lingual transfer and multi-modal learning.

Conclusion: The survey serves as a foundational reference for future Tibetan AI research and encourages collaborative efforts to build an inclusive AI ecosystem for low-resource languages.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention

dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages

TL;DR: LLMs fail to pass professional software engineering hiring evaluations despite their coding capabilities, showing significant inconsistencies with company-referenced solutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether LLMs can successfully pass standardized hiring evaluations used by tech companies to identify high-potential software and algorithm engineers.

Method: Comprehensive examination of a widely used professional assessment questionnaire using state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses, followed by performance evaluation against company-referenced solutions.

Result: Significant inconsistency between model-generated answers and company-referenced solutions; all evaluated LLMs failed to pass the hiring evaluation.

Conclusion: Contrary to expectations, current LLMs are not capable of passing professional software engineering hiring evaluations, indicating limitations in their ability to meet industry-specific competency requirements.

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

TL;DR: TSSS is an efficient multi-hop RAG framework that uses template-based reasoning with prefix caching and retriever-based termination to reduce token usage and improve stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing iterative prompting approaches for multi-hop RAG are inefficient due to regenerating predictable tokens and relying on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable termination.

Method: TSSS introduces (i) template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries to the main question, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator that deterministically halts reasoning when sub-queries become repetitive.

Result: On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT approaches.

Conclusion: TSSS enables both faster inference and more reliable answers, making it effective for efficiency-constrained scenarios like on-device inference.

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

TL;DR: evolveQA is a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on temporal knowledge conflicts using real-world time-stamped corpora, showing significant performance drops compared to static knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for temporal knowledge conflicts rely on structured knowledge bases with popular entities and lack dynamic structure to fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates.

Method: Constructed from 3 real-world time-stamped corpora (AWS updates, Azure changes, WHO disease outbreak reports), identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates.

Result: Evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge probing formats shows significant performance drops of up to 31% on evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Conclusion: evolveQA effectively reveals LLMs' limitations in handling temporally evolving knowledge and provides a more realistic evaluation framework for temporal knowledge conflicts.

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create a QA system that avoids dependency on large language models for retrieval augmented generation, instead leveraging knowledge graphs for more efficient and focused information retrieval.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: (1) pre-processing documents to generate QA pairs, (2) converting QAs into knowledge graph, then performing graph-based retrieval with embeddings and fuzzy techniques, followed by querying, re-ranking, and paraphrasing.

Result: Achieved 71.9% accuracy with LLAMA-3.2 and 54.4% with GPT-3.5-Turbo on CRAG benchmark using LLM-as-a-judge evaluation.

Conclusion: The proposed knowledge graph-based QA system without LLM RAG demonstrates competitive performance, offering an alternative approach to traditional retrieval augmented generation methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation methods fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn tool-augmented dialogues, particularly when agents misinterpret tool results but still appear satisfactory to users.

Method: Introduced TRACE benchmark with systematically synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and SCOPE framework that automatically discovers error patterns and evaluation rubrics.

Result: Experiments show SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, especially on challenging cases where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses limitations of current evaluation methods for tool-augmented conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiSRouter is a distributed query routing system where LLM agents self-assess their competence and decide whether to answer or route queries, outperforming centralized routing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current centralized routing systems are inflexible and struggle to understand different LLMs' knowledge boundaries, requiring a more scalable and effective approach to balance performance and costs.

Method: A distributed routing paradigm where queries traverse LLM networks, with each agent using self-awareness to decide routing. Includes two-stage Self-Awareness Training to enhance LLMs' competence judgment.

Result: DiSRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods in utility across scenarios, effectively distinguishes easy/hard queries, and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging LLMs' intrinsic self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, enabling more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: The paper introduces a framework for type-matched language distances that addresses limitations in existing linguistic knowledge bases by providing structure-aware representations and a principled method for aggregating linguistic signals into a composite distance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing linguistic knowledge bases like URIEL+ have limitations: their one-size-fits-all vector representations are unsuitable for diverse linguistic data structures, and they lack a principled method for aggregating different linguistic signals into a comprehensive score.

Method: Proposed novel structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and latent variables model for typology. Unified these signals into a robust, task-agnostic composite distance.

Result: The representations and composite distances consistently improved performance across a wide range of NLP tasks when selecting transfer languages.

Conclusion: The framework provides a more principled and effective toolkit for multilingual research by addressing key limitations in existing linguistic knowledge bases.

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit

TL;DR: SheetBrain is a neuro-symbolic dual workflow agent framework that improves LLM reasoning over complex spreadsheets through understanding, execution, and validation modules, achieving significant accuracy improvements on tabular QA and manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with accurately capturing complex spreadsheet structures and ensuring reasoning correctness for tabular data tasks.

Method: Three core modules: understanding module for spreadsheet overview and problem insight, execution module with Python sandbox and Excel toolkit for multi-turn reasoning, and validation module for correctness verification and re-execution.

Result: Significantly improves accuracy on both existing benchmarks and the more challenging SheetBench benchmark targeting large, multi-table, structurally complex spreadsheets.

Conclusion: SheetBrain effectively addresses LLM limitations in spreadsheet reasoning through its neuro-symbolic dual workflow approach, demonstrating strong performance across various tabular data tasks.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

*Yuto Tomikawa,Masaki Uto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question generation method using LLM with direct preference optimization for better difficulty control accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of conventional neural question generation methods: inability to generate multiple-choice questions and suboptimal difficulty control accuracy.

Method: Leverages large language model trained using direct preference optimization technique to improve difficulty control accuracy.

Result: Enables direct generation of multiple-choice questions with improved difficulty controllability for reading comprehension.

Conclusion: The proposed method successfully addresses key limitations of existing approaches by enabling multiple-choice question generation and enhancing difficulty control accuracy through direct preference optimization.

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

*Reza Esfandiarpoor,Vishwas Suryanarayanan,Stephen H. Bach,Vishal Chowdhary,Anthony Aue*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TheMCPCompany benchmark evaluates tool-calling agents on real-world service tasks using MCP servers with 18,000+ tools. Advanced models like GPT-5 perform well with tool retrieval, while smaller models struggle to leverage available tools effectively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current general-purpose agents mainly use web browsers for environment interaction, but task-specific tool sets via MCP offer easier development and maintenance than GUIs. The benchmark addresses the need to evaluate agents' ability to navigate complex tool environments.

Method: Created MCP servers using REST APIs of real-world services with over 18,000 tools, provided manually annotated ground-truth tools for each task, and evaluated agents with both ground-truth tools and tool retrieval approaches.

Result: Models with tool retrieval performed similarly or better than browser-based agents. GPT-5's performance with tool retrieval was close to ground-truth performance, but smaller models couldn't fully utilize available tools. Advanced models struggle with complex enterprise environments.

Conclusion: Navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining them for complex problems remains challenging for current models, requiring better reasoning and retrieval capabilities. TheMCPCompany reveals limitations in handling complex tool environments.

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

*Fan Xu,Huixuan Zhang,Zhenliang Zhang,Jiahao Wang,Xiaojun Wan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: JointCQ is a joint claim-and-query generation framework that improves hallucination detection in LLMs by addressing limitations in claim extraction and query generation stages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs suffer from hallucination issues, and existing detection methods have limitations in claim extraction (context loss) and query generation (low specificity), leading to degraded performance in the detection pipeline.

Method: Developed a joint claim-and-query generation framework that uses evaluation criteria to filter training data and finetunes a language model for simultaneous claim extraction and query generation.

Result: Outperforms previous methods on multiple open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks.

Conclusion: JointCQ advances the goal of more trustworthy and transparent language model systems by providing reliable inputs for downstream search and verification stages.

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

*Kailin Jiang,Hongbo Jiang,Ning Jiang,Zhi Gao,Jinhe Bi,Yuchen Ren,Bin Li,Yuntao Du,Lei Liu,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KORE is a method for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old knowledge, addressing catastrophic forgetting through knowledge-oriented augmentations and constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Multimodal Models have static knowledge that cannot keep up with real-world developments, and existing methods struggle with learning new knowledge while suffering from catastrophic forgetting.

Method: KORE converts knowledge items into structured knowledge for accurate learning, stores previous knowledge in covariance matrices, and initializes adapters by projecting original weights into null space to minimize interference.

Result: Extensive experiments on LLaVA-v1.5-7B, LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B show superior new knowledge injection performance and effective mitigation of catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: KORE successfully enables continuous knowledge acquisition in large multimodal models by achieving both knowledge adaptation and retention through its synergistic approach.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

TL;DR: The paper introduces HAD models for hallucination detection in NLG systems, featuring a comprehensive taxonomy, span-level identification and correction capabilities, and achieving SOTA results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the critical challenge of hallucination in large language models where they produce plausible but incorrect information, which undermines reliability and accuracy of NLG outputs.

Method: Propose HAD models that integrate hallucination detection, span-level identification, and correction in one inference process. Train on 90K synthetic samples and create HADTest benchmark with 2,248 annotated samples.

Result: HAD models outperform existing baselines and achieve state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and versatility across various NLG tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed HAD models provide an effective solution for hallucination detection in NLG systems, offering comprehensive detection capabilities and strong performance across multiple domains.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

*Junjie Song,Yiwen Liu,Dapeng Li,Yin Sun,Shukun Fu,Siqi Chen,Yuji Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HVO is a novel RL optimization strategy that uses hypervolume method to dynamically adjust scores between groups, guiding models to approximate Pareto front for balanced multi-objective text summarization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text summarization requires optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously (consistency, coherence, relevance, fluency), but few studies have focused on multi-objective optimization through RL with LLMs.

Method: Hypervolume Optimization (HVO) - dynamically adjusts scores between groups during RL reward process using hypervolume method to guide model optimization toward Pareto front.

Result: Outperforms GRPO in overall scores, shows more balanced performance across dimensions. 7B foundation model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 while maintaining shorter generation length.

Conclusion: HVO effectively addresses multi-objective optimization in text summarization, achieving balanced performance across multiple quality dimensions and competitive results with significantly smaller models.

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available

TL;DR: Integration of reasoning into speech large language models (speechLLMs) for slot-filling using chain-of-thought framework, showing performance improvements with reasoning steps and hybrid models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance speech large language models by incorporating reasoning capabilities for the end-to-end slot-filling task, inspired by recent developments in reasoning LLMs.

Method: Use chain-of-thought framework to decompose slot-filling into multiple reasoning steps, create reasoning dataset, apply supervised fine-tuning to speechLLMs, experiment with different LLM types/sizes as text foundation models, and develop hybrid models with both direct and reasoning modes.

Result: Performance improvements achieved by introducing reasoning steps, but reasoning textual LLMs developed for math/logic/coding domains might be inferior as foundation models. Hybrid speechLLMs with both direct and reasoning modes outperform those with only one mode.

Conclusion: Reasoning integration improves speechLLM performance for slot-filling, but careful selection of foundation models and hybrid approaches combining direct and reasoning modes yield the best results.

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

TL;DR: This paper investigates how personalizing LLMs with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate speech detection, particularly regarding identity-based biases between annotators and targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias in automated hate speech detection by incorporating socio-demographic attributes into LLMs, bridging psychological insights on group identity with NLP techniques.

Method: Used Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models with two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona prompting and deep contextualized persona development using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create richer persona profiles.

Result: Analysis showed that using in-group and out-group annotator personas impacts models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups, revealing both potential and limitations of persona-based approaches.

Conclusion: Persona-based approaches can help reduce bias in hate speech detection systems but have limitations, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable detection methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOGICAL is an efficient local PII removal system using fine-tuned GLiNER model that outperforms commercial solutions and large language models for de-identifying clinical notes, achieving 95% document sanitization accuracy while operating on standard hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PII removal from EHR clinical notes is essential for research and AI development, but current LLM solutions have high computational costs and data privacy risks, especially in low-resource settings.

Method: Fine-tuned GLiNER model on 2849 clinical text instances, defining 9 PII categories, and compared against Azure NER, Presidio, Gemini-Pro-2.5, and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct using character-level precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Result: Fine-tuned GLiNER achieved micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (0.845), correctly sanitized 95% of documents completely versus 64% for next-best solution, and operated efficiently on standard laptop without GPU.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned specialized transformer models like GLiNER offer accurate, computationally efficient, and secure PII removal solution, providing practical "sanitisation at the source" alternative to resource-intensive LLMs for resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: The paper introduces DnD Gesture++, an extended multi-party corpus with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations, and uses a Mixture-of-Experts framework to show that incorporating semantically guided gestures improves turn-taking prediction over text and audio baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use multimodal cues including gestures for turn-taking in conversation, but current models often overlook the complementary role of gestures beyond linguistic and acoustic features.

Method: Extended DnD Gesture corpus with semantic gesture annotations, then used Mixture-of-Experts framework integrating text, audio, and gestures for turn-taking prediction.

Result: Incorporating semantically guided gestures yielded consistent performance gains over baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

Conclusion: Gestures provide valuable complementary cues for turn-taking prediction, and semantically guided gesture modeling enhances multimodal conversation systems.

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

TL;DR: M3-SLU is a new multimodal benchmark for evaluating speaker-attributed reasoning in multi-speaker conversations, revealing that current models struggle with identifying who said what despite understanding what was said.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension but struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning - understanding who said what and when in natural conversations.

Method: Built from four open corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, AMI) with over 12,000 validated instances containing audio, transcripts, and metadata. Includes two tasks: Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and Speaker Attribution via Utterance Matching.

Result: Baseline results show models can capture what was said but often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware dialogue understanding.

Conclusion: M3-SLU serves as a challenging benchmark to advance research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

TL;DR: AgenticMath is a novel agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs to enhance LLM fine-tuning, achieving competitive performance with much smaller datasets than traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods for creating datasets to improve LLM reasoning suffer from generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from available data sources.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: (1) Seed Question Filter for high-quality questions, (2) Agentic Question Rephrase using multi-agent system for diverse paraphrases, (3) Answer Augment with chain-of-thought reasoning for correctness, (4) Question and Answer Evaluation to retain only superior pairs.

Result: Fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath datasets (30-60K samples) achieves competitive or superior performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much larger datasets (400K-2.3M samples).

Conclusion: Targeted, high-quality data generation is a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

*Siyuan Wang,Gaokai Zhang,Li Lyna Zhang,Ning Shang,Fan Yang,Dongyao Chen,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL is a data-driven RL method that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context tasks using UUID chains, enabling models to learn advanced reasoning patterns that generalize to much longer contexts without full-length RL training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While RL enhances short-context reasoning, advanced thinking patterns for long-context reasoning remain unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data are scarce.

Method: KeyChain synthesis approach transforms short multi-hop QA into long-context tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among distracting documents, requiring step-by-step tracing, question identification, fact retrieval, and reasoning.

Result: Models trained at 16K effectively solve 128K tasks, with Qwen2.5-7B and 14B showing +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains in long-context multi-hop QA accuracy. LoongRL-14B reaches 74.2 score, rivaling larger frontier models.

Conclusion: LoongRL induces emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning patterns that generalize beyond training length, improves long-context retrieval, passes 128K needle-in-a-haystack tests, and preserves short-context reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

### [44] [The Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19365)
*Umar Butler,Abdur-Rahman Butler,Adrian Lucas Malec*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MLEB is the largest open-source benchmark for legal information retrieval, featuring 10 expert-annotated datasets across multiple jurisdictions, document types, and task types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of comprehensive, diverse, and open-source benchmarks for legal information retrieval across different jurisdictions and document types.

Method: Created 10 expert-annotated datasets spanning multiple jurisdictions (US, UK, EU, Australia, Ireland, Singapore), document types (cases, legislation, regulatory guidance, contracts, literature), and task types (search, zero-shot classification, question answering). Seven datasets were newly constructed to fill domain and jurisdictional gaps.

Result: Developed the largest, most diverse, and most comprehensive open-source benchmark for legal information retrieval, with code, results, and data released for reproducible evaluations.

Conclusion: MLEB provides a significant advancement in legal information retrieval benchmarking by offering extensive coverage across jurisdictions and document types, enabling more robust and reproducible evaluations in the legal domain.

Abstract: We present the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB), the largest, most
diverse, and most comprehensive open-source benchmark for legal information
retrieval to date. MLEB consists of ten expert-annotated datasets spanning
multiple jurisdictions (the US, UK, EU, Australia, Ireland, and Singapore),
document types (cases, legislation, regulatory guidance, contracts, and
literature), and task types (search, zero-shot classification, and question
answering). Seven of the datasets in MLEB were newly constructed in order to
fill domain and jurisdictional gaps in the open-source legal information
retrieval landscape. We document our methodology in building MLEB and creating
the new constituent datasets, and release our code, results, and data openly to
assist with reproducible evaluations.

### [45] [MoE-Prism: Disentangling Monolithic Experts for Elastic MoE Services via Model-System Co-Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19366)
*Xinfeng Xia,Jiacheng Liu,Xiaofeng Hou,Peng Tang,Mingxuan Zhang,Wenfeng Wang,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoE-Prism transforms rigid Mixture-of-Experts models into elastic services by decomposing monolithic experts into fine-grained sub-experts and implementing QoS-aware scheduling, providing more operating points and better cost-quality trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoE models suffer from a 'quality cliff' with only a few coarse-grained operating points, forcing difficult trade-offs between cost and quality and preventing adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives, leading to resource over-provisioning.

Method: Two-phase approach: 1) Offline Refactoring Engine deconstructs monolithic experts into fine-grained sub-experts using partitioning optimization solver with metaheuristic-based neuron grouping; 2) Online Scheduling Engine implements QoS-aware scheduling with specialized policies for throughput maximization and latency-optimized offloading.

Result: Provides over 4 times more distinct, stable operating points than baseline, enables dynamic throughput improvement by up to 19.9% under strict latency budget, and reduces latency by up to 10.36% under limited resources across three different MoE models.

Conclusion: MoE-Prism bridges the model-system gap with a critical 'control knob' for adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services, enabling the next generation of elastic AI deployments.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

### [46] [Sign Language Translation with Sentence Embedding Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19367)
*Yasser Hamidullah,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A novel gloss-free sign language translation approach that uses sentence embeddings of target sentences instead of manual gloss annotations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on German and American sign language datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SLT systems rely on gloss annotations which are scarce, inconsistent across datasets, and require manual labeling. The authors aim to eliminate this dependency on gloss annotations.

Method: Uses sentence embeddings of target sentences as supervision during training instead of glosses. The embeddings are learned from raw textual data and can be mono- or multilingual. Evaluated on German (PHOENIX-2014T) and American (How2Sign) sign language datasets.

Result: Significantly outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting new state-of-the-art for datasets without gloss annotations. Diminishes the gap between gloss-free and gloss-dependent systems when no additional SLT datasets are used for pretraining.

Conclusion: The proposed gloss-free approach using sentence embeddings effectively replaces manual gloss annotations, enabling scalable SLT without requiring expensive annotation efforts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Shakib Yazdani,Cennet Oguz,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes using language-agnostic multimodal embeddings trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise sign language translation, enabling direct multilingual translation and addressing data scarcity through coupled augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sign language translation is limited by training with text in a single spoken language, which restricts scalability and cross-language generalization. Existing approaches using text-based sentence embeddings remain tied to specific languages and modalities.

Method: Employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT. Propose coupled augmentation combining multilingual target augmentations (translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations to improve model robustness and address data scarcity.

Result: Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: Language-agnostic embedding supervision combined with coupled augmentation provides a scalable and semantically robust alternative to traditional SLT training.

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR is a lightweight model (<300K parameters) that probes mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers, achieving 93% recall zero-shot and over 90% precision with LLM as judge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mention detection is foundational for information extraction but remains a performance bottleneck. The paper aims to show that structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently recovered.

Method: Probe early LLM layers for mention detection using a lightweight model (ToMMeR) with <300K parameters. Use cross-model analysis across diverse architectures (14M-15B parameters) and extend with span classification heads for NER.

Result: Achieves 93% recall zero-shot across 13 NER benchmarks, with >90% precision using LLM as judge. Cross-model analysis shows convergence on mention boundaries (DICE >75%). With span classification, achieves near SOTA NER performance (80-87% F1).

Conclusion: Structured entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently recovered with minimal parameters, as mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling.

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

### [49] [Spatio-temporal Sign Language Representation and Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19413)
*Yasser Hamidullah,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DFKI-MLT's submission to WMT-SLT 2022 for Swiss German Sign Language to German translation using an end-to-end spatio-temporal model that achieved 5 BLEU on dev but only 0.11 BLEU on test.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SLT approaches using seq2seq with video frame features often fail to leverage temporal information effectively, limiting generalization to new datasets.

Method: Developed a single model that learns spatio-temporal feature representations and translation simultaneously, creating a true end-to-end architecture for sign language translation.

Result: Achieved 5±1 BLEU points on development set, but performance dropped significantly to 0.11±0.06 BLEU points on the test set.

Conclusion: The end-to-end spatio-temporal approach shows promise but suffers from poor generalization to unseen test data, indicating need for improved robustness.

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

*Yuan Gao,Suchir Salhan,Andrew Caines,Paula Buttery,Weiwei Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0 is a benchmark that evaluates cognitively inspired models using selective tolerance - testing whether models find naturalistic learner errors more plausible than artificial errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and evaluation of cognitively inspired models by measuring alignment with human language acquisition patterns.

Method: Created benchmark from 2.8M naturalistic learner sentences, providing 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) to test selective tolerance - whether models prefer naturalistic learner errors over artificial ones.

Result: Experiments show selective tolerance is distinct from standard grammaticality, with performance clustering strongly by training paradigm, validating BLiSS as a robust evaluation tool.

Conclusion: BLiSS successfully measures how different training objectives impact model alignment with human language acquisition patterns through selective tolerance testing.

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

*Kailin Jiang,Ning Jiang,Yuchen Ren,Yuchen Li,Yifan Gao,Jinhe Bi,Yunpu Ma,Qingqing Liu,Xianhao Wang,Yifan Jia,Hongbo Jiang,Yaocong Hu,Bin Li,Lei Liu,Yuntao Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MINED is a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating temporal awareness in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across 6 dimensions and 11 tasks, revealing that most LMMs struggle with time-sensitive knowledge and can be improved through knowledge editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LMMs have static representations that struggle with time-sensitive factual knowledge, and existing benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating temporal awareness.

Method: Constructed MINED benchmark from Wikipedia with 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge samples across 6 knowledge types, evaluated 15 LMMs on 6 dimensions and 11 tasks, and investigated knowledge editing methods.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieved highest average CEM score (63.07), most open-source LMMs lack time understanding, LMMs perform best on organization knowledge and worst on sport knowledge, and knowledge editing effectively updates time-sensitive knowledge in single editing scenarios.

Conclusion: LMMs need improved temporal awareness capabilities, knowledge editing shows promise for updating time-sensitive knowledge, and MINED provides a comprehensive evaluation framework for temporal understanding in multimodal models.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

*Yuu Jinnai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MBR decoding outperforms beam search for speech-to-text tasks like ASR and ST, showing promising results for high-accuracy offline applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBR decoding has shown success in text-to-text generation tasks, so the authors investigate if it can also improve performance in speech-to-text tasks where beam search is currently standard practice.

Method: Evaluated MBR decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its derivative models, comparing against beam search.

Result: MBR decoding outperformed beam search in most experimental settings for both ASR and ST tasks.

Conclusion: MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST tasks that require high accuracy.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

TL;DR: VideoAgentTrek automatically mines training data from screen-recorded videos to train computer-use agents, eliminating manual annotation by using an inverse dynamics module to extract GUI actions and parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual annotation of GUI interaction data for training computer-use agents is prohibitively expensive, creating a need for scalable automated data generation methods.

Method: Developed Video2Action inverse dynamics module with video grounding model for temporal action detection and action-content recognizer for extracting structured parameters like click coordinates and typed text. Applied to 39,000 YouTube tutorial videos.

Result: Generated 1.52 million interaction steps automatically. On OSWorld-Verified, task success rates improved from 9.3% to 15.8% (70% relative improvement). On AgentNetBench, step accuracy increased from 64.1% to 69.3%.

Conclusion: Passive internet videos can be effectively transformed into high-quality supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to expensive manual annotation.

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

### [54] [Machine Text Detectors are Membership Inference Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19492)
*Ryuto Koike,Liam Dugan,Masahiro Kaneko,Chris Callison-Burch,Naoaki Okazaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper demonstrates strong transferability between membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text detection methods, showing they share the same optimal theoretical metric and that methods from one task can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the other.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIAs and machine text detection have been studied independently despite sharing methodological foundations based on language model probability distributions, potentially missing valuable insights and stronger methods developed in the other field.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving the same optimal metric for both tasks, and large-scale empirical experiments with 7 MIA methods and 5 machine text detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, plus introduction of MINT evaluation suite.

Result: Strong rank correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance, with Binoculars (originally for machine text detection) achieving state-of-the-art on MIA benchmarks, confirming transferability hypothesis.

Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between research communities, facilitated by the MINT unified evaluation suite.

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

*Suchir Salhan,Richard Diehl Martinez,Zébulon Goriely,Paula Buttery*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper examines optimal sequence length for BabyLM pretraining, finding that longer isn't always better - optimal length depends on task type and model architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many BabyLM Challenge submissions use shorter sequence lengths than typical transformer models, prompting investigation into what sequence length works best for training Baby LMs.

Method: Compared 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models using 100M-word training data with fixed compute budgets across different sequence lengths.

Result: Longer sequences are often better but optimal length depends on task and architecture. Shorter sequences suffice for grammatical generalization, while longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning.

Conclusion: Sequence length optimization should be task-specific and architecture-aware rather than simply using the longest possible context window.

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

### [56] [Lookahead Routing for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19506)
*Canbin Huang,Tianyuan Shi,Yuhua Zhu,Ruijun Chen,Xiaojun Quan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lookahead is a routing framework that predicts potential model outputs to guide model selection, outperforming existing methods by 7.7% across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM routing approaches treat routing as classification based only on input queries, missing valuable information from potential outputs and failing to capture implicit intent that emerges during response generation.

Method: Lookahead "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, implementing two approaches based on causal and masked language models.

Result: Empirical evaluations across seven benchmarks show Lookahead consistently outperforms existing routing baselines with 7.7% average performance gain over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Lookahead framework enables more informed routing decisions by predicting potential outputs, addressing limitations of query-only routing approaches for complex or ambiguous queries.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) routers improve the efficiency of multi-model
systems by directing each query to the most appropriate model while leveraging
the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

### [57] [Which Evaluation for Which Model? A Taxonomy for Speech Model Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19509)
*Maureen de Seyssel,Eeshan Gunesh Dhekane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper proposes a unified taxonomy for evaluating speech foundation models across different tasks and model types, defining three axes: evaluation aspect, model capabilities, and task requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of speech foundation models is disjointed across tasks and model types, with different models excelling at different aspects of speech processing, requiring a systematic framework for appropriate evaluation selection.

Method: Develops a taxonomy with three orthogonal axes: evaluation aspect being measured, model capabilities required, and task/protocol requirements. Classifies existing evaluations and benchmarks along these axes.

Result: The taxonomy provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation methods and reveals systematic gaps in current evaluations (limited coverage of prosody, interaction, reasoning).

Conclusion: This work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models, highlighting priorities for future benchmark design.

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

### [58] [Conditions for Catastrophic Forgetting in Multilingual Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19546)
*Danni Liu,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Systematic study reveals that relative scale between model and data size is primary determinant of catastrophic forgetting in multilingual fine-tuning, with instruction-following ability being more critical than architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address ambiguity in literature about when catastrophic forgetting occurs during multilingual fine-tuning, as current results are fragmented.

Method: Controlled experiments across different model architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches using machine translation as testbed.

Result: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers no clear advantage over full fine-tuning; cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting and facilitate positive transfer to unseen languages.

Conclusion: Model's instruction-following ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than architecture, and cross-lingual alignment is effective for mitigating forgetting.

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBBQ is a comprehensive benchmark dataset for evaluating social biases in Persian LLMs, covering 16 cultural categories with over 37,000 questions, revealing significant biases in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in resources for detecting social biases in Persian cultural contexts, as existing bias detection research lacks coverage for Persian language and culture.

Method: Developed PBBQ dataset through questionnaires completed by 250 diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in collaboration with social science experts. Benchmarked several open-source and closed-source LLMs, including Persian-specific fine-tuned models.

Result: Current LLMs exhibit significant social biases across Persian culture. LLMs often replicate human bias patterns, showing complex interplay between learned representations and cultural stereotypes.

Conclusion: The PBBQ dataset provides a foundation for evaluating and mitigating bias in Persian language models, highlighting the need for cultural context-aware bias detection and mitigation approaches.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

*Daryna Dementieva,Evgeniya Sukhodolskaya,Alexander Fraser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: The paper introduces CrossNews-UA, a scalable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity assessment, addressing limitations of manually curated datasets in fake news detection across multiple languages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing cross-lingual news analysis datasets are manually curated by experts, limiting scalability and adaptability to new languages, particularly for fake news detection in the era of rapid misinformation spread.

Method: Developed a scalable, explainable crowdsourcing pipeline to collect CrossNews-UA dataset with Ukrainian as central language and Polish, Russian, and English as relevant languages. Each news pair annotated for semantic similarity using 4W criteria (Who, What, Where, When).

Result: Tested various models including traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures, and large language models (LLMs). Results revealed challenges in multilingual news analysis and provided insights into model performance.

Conclusion: The proposed crowdsourcing pipeline enables scalable cross-lingual news similarity assessment, addressing limitations of manual curation and providing valuable dataset for multilingual fake news detection research.

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Style Attack Disguise (SAD) exploits the human-model perception gap in reading stylistic fonts and emoji to attack NLP models while remaining human-readable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social media users use stylistic fonts and emoji for self-expression, creating a gap where humans can read these texts easily but NLP models process them as distinct tokens, introducing vulnerabilities.

Method: Proposed SAD attack with two variants: light version for query efficiency and strong version for superior attack performance. Tested on sentiment classification, machine translation, and multimodal tasks.

Result: SAD demonstrates strong attack performance across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services. Also shows potential threats to multimodal tasks like text-to-image and text-to-speech generation.

Conclusion: The human-model perception gap in processing stylistic text creates significant security vulnerabilities that can be exploited through style-based attacks like SAD.

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LlavaCode compresses code context into single-token vectors to speed up retrieval-augmented generation for code completion while maintaining quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-augmented generation for code completion suffers from slow inference due to extended sequence lengths from context, which is problematic for interactive IDE settings.

Method: Introduces a framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich single-token representations using a small projector module, reducing context to few compressed vectors.

Result: Achieves 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token on line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines, with improved EM and ES metrics and negligible latency increase.

Conclusion: Compressed context enables faster inference for code completion while enhancing generation quality, making it suitable for interactive development environments.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: This paper compares fine-tuning vs prompt engineering for emotion detection in LLMs, finding fine-tuned models achieve >70% accuracy and that LLMs need structured prompts and emotion grouping for better performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer models have advanced emotion recognition but face challenges with open-ended queries due to contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and complex emotional expressions, making direct application of generalist models difficult.

Method: Compares fine-tuning pre-trained models vs prompt engineering in three scenarios: (i) fine-tuned models vs LLMs with simple prompts, (ii) different emotion prompt designs, and (iii) impact of emotion grouping techniques.

Result: Experimental tests achieved metrics above 70% with fine-tuned pre-trained models for emotion recognition. LLMs require structured prompt engineering and emotion grouping to enhance performance.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning outperforms simple prompt engineering for emotion detection. Structured prompts and emotion grouping are essential for improving LLM performance in emotion analysis tasks.

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

*Xiang Liu,Xuming Hu,Xiaowen Chu,Eunsol Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiffAdapt is a lightweight framework that uses entropy analysis to detect overthinking in LLMs and adaptively selects inference strategies (Easy/Normal/Hard) per question to reduce token usage by up to 22.4% while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate long reasoning traces with unclear utility, leading to inefficient computation. The paper aims to improve efficiency by preventing overthinking on easy problems while maintaining performance on harder ones.

Method: Analyzed entropy patterns in reasoning traces across models, observed U-shaped entropy distribution, and developed DiffAdapt - a framework that classifies question difficulty using a small probe on LLM's final hidden state and selects appropriate inference strategies (prompt, temperature, max tokens) per question.

Result: Achieved comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4% across five models and eight benchmarks, demonstrating efficient reasoning without fine-tuning base LLMs.

Conclusion: DiffAdapt provides a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning by adaptively selecting inference strategies based on question difficulty and entropy analysis, enabling LLMs to reach high performance without overthinking.

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

*Hasan Akgul,Mari Eplik,Javier Rojas,Aina Binti Abdullah,Pieter van der Merwe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSense-LLM is an edge-first framework that converts multimodal sensor data into semantic tokens and integrates with LLMs while maintaining strict latency, energy, bandwidth, and privacy constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable large language model deployments in interference-prone environments by addressing the challenges of latency, energy consumption, bandwidth limitations, and privacy concerns when processing continuous multimodal sensor streams.

Method: The framework consists of four components: SenseFusion (lightweight encoder for sensor-to-language alignment), Edge-RAG (local hybrid retrieval for grounding), PromptRouter (cost-aware policy for edge/cloud routing), and Secure Execution (data minimization and redaction).

Result: Achieves sub-second end-to-end latency, reduces inter-tier token and bandwidth costs, improves factual consistency, enables selective abstention, and lowers energy consumption while preserving privacy by transmitting only discrete codes.

Conclusion: Edge-first design successfully treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co-equal goals for large model deployments in challenging environments.

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

*Addison J. Wu,Ryan Liu,Kerem Oktar,Theodore R. Sumers,Thomas L. Griffiths*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs show basic sensitivity to human motivations but struggle with real-world applications like sponsored ads, though simple interventions can improve their motivational vigilance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if LLMs can critically evaluate content by factoring in source motivations, similar to how humans assess credibility based on intentions and incentives.

Method: Used controlled experiments from cognitive science to test LLMs' ability to discount biased information, then extended evaluation to sponsored online advertisements with steering interventions.

Result: LLMs successfully discount biased information in controlled settings but perform poorly with real-world sponsored ads; simple interventions boosting intention salience significantly improve performance.

Conclusion: LLMs possess basic sensitivity to motivations but need further improvements to generalize effectively to novel real-world settings requiring motivational vigilance.

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

*Cesar Gonzalez-Gutierrez,Dirk Hovy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Prompting affects LM representations but changes don't consistently correlate with prompt relevance to tasks, challenging assumptions about relevant prompts leading to better representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how prompting enables LMs to perform diverse tasks without supervision and study the relationship between prompting and internal representation quality.

Method: Conducted probing experiments on prompt embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot classification.

Result: Prompting affects representation quality but these changes don't consistently correlate with prompt relevance to target tasks.

Conclusion: Challenges the assumption that more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations, with further analysis needed on contributing factors.

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

TL;DR: EUDial is a multi-turn dialogue dataset from EU parliamentary blogs, and LexGuide is a framework using retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topics to improve legal information accessibility for citizens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal information is hard for laypeople to understand despite open access to EU legislation and documents. There's a gap between available legal resources and citizen comprehension.

Method: Created EUDial dataset from 204 parliamentary blogs containing 880 dialogue turns. Proposed LexGuide framework using retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic organization for structured dialogue progression.

Result: Proactive, structured navigation effectively bridges the gap between legal information availability and citizen understanding.

Conclusion: EUDial and LexGuide provide practical resources for advancing proactive legal dialogue systems that make legal information more accessible to citizens.

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

*M. H. I. Abdalla,Zhipin Wang,Christian Frey,Steffen Eger,Josif Grabocka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Zhyper is a parameter-efficient hypernetwork framework that generates context-aware LoRA adapters from text descriptions for LLM conditioning, achieving competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters than SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods for LLM conditioning through fine-tuning require large numbers of parameters, and prompt engineering fails to ensure desired conditioning due to pre-training biases.

Method: Proposed Zhyper framework uses factorized hypernetworks to generate context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions of desired conditioning.

Result: Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x fewer parameters than state-of-the-art baselines, and shows improved generalization to out-of-domain settings and better capture of fine-grained contextual values.

Conclusion: Zhyper provides an effective parameter-efficient solution for LLM conditioning that outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

*Xichen Zhang,Sitong Wu,Haoru Tan,Shaozuo Yu,Yinghao Zhu,Ziyi He,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SmartSwitch is a plug-and-play inference framework that detects and addresses underthinking in LLMs by monitoring reasoning processes, identifying prematurely abandoned high-potential thoughts, and guiding models to explore them more deeply.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the problem of 'underthinking' in LLMs where models exhibit shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient exploration, which limits both performance and token efficiency.

Method: Uses a perception module to detect thought switches and evaluate potential using process reward models, and an intervention module that backtracks and inserts 'deepening prompts' to encourage deeper exploration of promising thoughts.

Result: Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks show significant performance improvements across various LLMs of different sizes.

Conclusion: SmartSwitch effectively enhances LLM reasoning by mitigating underthinking through targeted intervention and deeper exploration of promising thought paths.

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

*Yuezhou Hu,Jiaxin Guo,Xinyu Feng,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSPEC improves speculative decoding by using selective token filtering during knowledge distillation to focus on easier-to-fit tokens, increasing token acceptance rates without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional knowledge distillation methods for speculative decoding are misaligned with the actual objective of maximizing token acceptance rate, leading draft models to struggle with capacity constraints and suboptimal performance.

Method: AdaSPEC incorporates selective token filtering into knowledge distillation using a reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, allowing the draft model to better align with the target model on simpler tokens.

Result: AdaSPEC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DistillSpec method across diverse tasks (arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, summarization) with model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters, achieving up to 15% higher acceptance rates.

Conclusion: AdaSPEC effectively addresses the misalignment between knowledge distillation objectives and speculative decoding goals, improving token acceptance rates while maintaining generation quality across various tasks.

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Model merging outperforms conventional adaptation methods for code-mixed NLP, achieving 2-5 F1 point gains over full fine-tuning and better cross-language transfer than monolingual baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a practical alternative to conventional adaptation strategies for code-mixed NLP that can better leverage unlabeled data and improve performance on low-resource language pairs.

Method: Start with multilingual base model, perform continued pre-training on unlabeled code-mixed text, merge checkpoint with base model, then fine-tune on downstream task data. Evaluated on English-Hindi and English-Spanish sentence classification using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models.

Result: Merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning (2-5 F1 points gain) and CPT->FT (~1-2 points gain). Better cross-pair transfer than monolingual baselines (0.65-0.68 F1 vs 0.61-0.63). Zero/few-shot prompting with larger LLMs lags behind fine-tuned models.

Conclusion: Model merging effectively leverages unlabeled data for code-mixed NLP and provides more reliable knowledge transfer for low-resource language pairs. The paper provides adaptation recipes for different data regimes and discusses scaling considerations.

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

*Saptarshi Sengupta,Zhengyu Zhou,Jun Araki,Xingbo Wang,Bingqing Wang,Suhang Wang,Zhe Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolDreamer improves tool retrieval for LLMs by generating synthetic tool descriptions that better align with user queries, enabling more effective handling of large tool sets without exceeding context window limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing tool retrieval methods perform poorly because user queries often don't match the language of tool descriptions, leading to suboptimal retrieval when dealing with large tool sets that exceed LLM context windows.

Method: Propose ToolDreamer framework that conditions retriever models to fetch tools based on hypothetical synthetic tool descriptions generated by an LLM - descriptions of tools the LLM thinks would be useful for the query.

Result: Applied on ToolRet dataset, ToolDreamer improves performance of both sparse and dense retrievers with and without training, demonstrating flexibility and effectiveness.

Conclusion: ToolDreamer successfully offloads reasoning burden to the retriever, allowing LLMs to effectively handle large tool collections without overwhelming their context window limitations.

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

*David Mora,Viraat Aryabumi,Wei-Yin Ko,Sara Hooker,Julia Kreutzer,Marzieh Fadaee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A lightweight framework for optimizing multilingual prompts through naturalness, cultural adaptation, and difficulty enhancement, achieving significant performance improvements over translation-only baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic data for multilingual LLMs is bottlenecked by translation-based prompts that inherit English-centric framing and neglect cultural dimensions, constraining model generalization.

Method: Introduces prompt-space optimization where translated prompts are systematically transformed for Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement using an off-the-shelf multilingual LLM across 12 languages spanning 7 families.

Result: Achieved substantial improvements: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores XCometXL, and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard under identical data conditions.

Conclusion: Prompt-space optimization is established as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building more robust, culturally grounded, and globally capable multilingual LLMs.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

*Xichen Zhang,Sitong Wu,Yinghao Zhu,Haoru Tan,Shaozuo Yu,Ziyi He,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaf-GRPO addresses the 'learning cliff' in RL training by providing tiered hints when models plateau, enabling them to solve problems beyond current capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the 'learning cliff' phenomenon where models fail on problems far beyond their capabilities, yielding zero-reward signals that stall learning progress in policy optimization algorithms like GRPO.

Method: Progressive training framework that diagnoses learning stagnation and intervenes with tiered in-prompt hints (from abstract concepts to concrete steps), allowing models to construct valid solutions independently.

Result: Boosted pass@1 score of Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on AIME24 benchmark by 44.3% relative improvement over vanilla GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: Provides robust methodology for unlocking models' ability to solve previously unsolvable problems, extending the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

*Johnny Tian-Zheng Wei,Ameya Godbole,Mohammad Aflah Khan,Ryan Wang,Xiaoyuan Zhu,James Flemings,Nitya Kashyap,Krishna P. Gummadi,Willie Neiswanger,Robin Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Hubble is an open-source LLM suite for studying memorization, featuring standard and perturbed models that show memorization risks depend on sensitive data frequency relative to corpus size, and that early exposure helps retention while dilution through larger corpora reduces risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scientific study of LLM memorization by providing controlled datasets with inserted text to emulate memorization risks and understand how different factors affect data retention.

Method: Created 8 models (standard and perturbed variants with 1B/8B parameters trained on 100B/500B tokens) plus 6 additional perturbed models with text inserted at different pretraining phases to study memorization patterns.

Result: Found that memorization depends on sensitive data frequency relative to corpus size, and that data without continued exposure can be forgotten. Early training exposure improves retention while larger corpora dilute memorization risks.

Conclusion: Proposes two best practices: dilute sensitive data with larger training corpora and order sensitive data to appear earlier in training. Hubble serves as a testbed for membership inference, machine unlearning, and broader memorization research.

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Conclusion: The paper identifies opportunities for under-explored dimensionality reduction algorithms and their future applications in Earth observation research, serving as a comprehensive handbook for the field.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,

TL;DR: Ninja Codes are stealthy fiducial markers generated by neural networks that blend into real-world environments, providing 6-DoF location tracking while being visually inconspicuous.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fiducial markers have conspicuous appearances that make them undesirable for aesthetic reasons in many applications like augmented reality and robotics.

Method: An encoder network applies visually modest alterations to arbitrary images to create Ninja Codes. An end-to-end process jointly trains network modules for creation and detection using deep steganography techniques.

Result: Ninja Codes provide reliable location tracking under common indoor lighting conditions while successfully concealing themselves within diverse environmental textures. They can be printed on regular paper with standard printers.

Conclusion: Ninja Codes offer particular value in scenarios where traditional markers are undesirable due to their conspicuous appearance, enabling stealthy tracking for AR, robotics, and motion interfaces.

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that uses multimodal LLMs with camera inputs, temporal history, and chain-of-thought prompting to answer perception, prediction, and planning questions, achieving significant accuracy improvements over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a robust question-answering system for autonomous driving that can handle high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions by leveraging multimodal language models with contextual grounding and carefully engineered prompts.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase-1 uses Qwen2.5-VL-32B with six-camera inputs, temporal history, and chain-of-thought prompting with few-shot exemplars, plus self-consistency ensemble. Phase-2 augments with nuScenes scene metadata and category-specific question instructions for different task types.

Result: Achieved 67.37% overall accuracy, with Phase-1 reaching 65.1% (vs 62.61% zero-shot) and 66.85% with self-consistency. Maintained 96% accuracy under severe visual corruption, significantly outperforming baseline Qwen2.5 models.

Conclusion: Carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance high-level driving QA performance with pretrained vision-language models, demonstrating the importance of prompt design and multimodal context integration.

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D is a novel state-space architecture for longitudinal medical imaging that effectively models sequences of high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals by integrating true time differences into state transitions and using multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods fail to fully exploit spatial and temporal cues in sequential radiological images captured at irregular intervals, often compromising by collapsing spatial information or using inefficient spatio-temporal models incompatible with non-uniform time steps.

Method: A continuous-time selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates irregular inter-visit intervals into state transitions, complemented by a multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module to capture spatio-temporal relationships efficiently.

Result: Superior performance in breast cancer risk prediction benchmark, improving validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to recurrent, transformer, and state-space models.

Conclusion: The model provides a computationally efficient framework for longitudinal image analysis, capable of processing long and complex patient screening histories thanks to its linear complexity.

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A motion-centric alignment framework that disentangles motion features from pretrained video encoders and aligns them with text-to-video diffusion models to improve temporal coherence and physical plausibility in generated videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-video diffusion models often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion due to insufficient understanding of complex motions. Existing methods using pretrained video encoders suffer from entangled appearance and dynamics features.

Method: Proposes learning a disentangled motion subspace from pretrained video encoders optimized to predict ground-truth optical flow, then aligning diffusion model features to this motion subspace.

Result: Improves physical commonsense in state-of-the-art video diffusion models while preserving text adherence, validated on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench, and VBench-2.0 benchmarks and user studies.

Conclusion: The motion-centric alignment framework effectively enhances motion quality in text-to-video generation by leveraging disentangled motion knowledge from pretrained encoders.

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh is a new metric for detailed image description evaluation that uses scene graphs to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, providing better correlation with human judgments than existing metrics. The paper also introduces DOCENT, a challenging new dataset for evaluating detailed image description in the art domain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics like CIDEr and SPICE were designed for short texts and don't effectively evaluate detailed image descriptions, which require sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and localized error detection.

Method: PoSh uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores based on fine-grained errors in compositional understanding. The paper also introduces DOCENT dataset with artwork, expert references, and human judgments from art history students.

Result: PoSh achieves +0.05 Spearman ρ improvement over best alternatives, is robust across image types, works as an effective reward function, and reveals that foundation models struggle with full error-free coverage of images with rich scene dynamics.

Conclusion: PoSh and DOCENT enable better evaluation of detailed image description metrics and establish a demanding new task to measure VLM progress, with potential applications in assistive text generation.

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

TL;DR: UniHPR is a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline that aligns pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses using a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D pose estimation and enabling cross-modal pose retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in multi-modal alignment pipelines for human-centric applications, but limited research on correlating diverse human pose representations (images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models) using contrastive learning approaches.

Method: Proposes UniHPR pipeline with a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss to align more than two data representations simultaneously, specifically aligning human pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D poses.

Result: Achieves MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW with cross-domain evaluation. Enables 2D/3D pose retrieval with 9.24mm MPJPE error on Human3.6M.

Conclusion: UniHPR successfully creates unified human pose representations that bridge different modalities, demonstrating strong performance in pose estimation tasks and enabling effective cross-modal retrieval capabilities.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

TL;DR: This paper proposes an improved 3D U-Net model with attention mechanism for brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans, addressing challenges like irregular tumor shapes and class imbalance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard U-Net models struggle with accurately delineating irregular tumor shapes and ambiguous boundaries in brain MRI scans, and face computational challenges with high-resolution data and class imbalance issues.

Method: Integration of attention mechanism into 3D U-Net model to capture intricate details and prioritize informative regions, combined with a tumor detection algorithm using digital image processing to address class imbalance.

Result: The model achieved excellent performance on BraTS 2020 dataset with dice score of 0.975, specificity of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, outperforming related studies.

Conclusion: The proposed attention-enhanced 3D U-Net model effectively improves brain tumor segmentation performance, offering valuable insights for reliable clinical diagnosis.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Conclusion: FedProx shows promise as an approach for training precise machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets while maintaining privacy.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: X-Ego-CS dataset with synchronized first-person views from Counter-Strike 2 enables multi-agent decision-making research, and Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) improves teammate/opponent location prediction from single egocentric views.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sports video understanding relies on third-person views and overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning in complex 3D environments.

Method: Created X-Ego-CS dataset with 124 hours of synchronized first-person gameplay footage from Counter-Strike 2, and proposed Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL) to align teammates' egocentric visual streams for team-level tactical awareness.

Result: CECL demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing agents' ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS and CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in esports, positioning gameplay understanding as a testbed for multi-agent modeling with implications for spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming.

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning networks applied to detect malaria in blood cell images, with Residual Attention Network and XceptionNet achieving ~97.5% accuracy, outperforming other methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual malaria diagnosis through microscope observation is prone to errors due to lack of expertise and manual involvement, requiring automated computer-aided diagnosis.

Method: Applied six deep convolutional networks (AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention Network, DenseNet-121, Custom-CNN) to extract features from blood cell images and classify them as malaria-infected or healthy.

Result: Residual Attention Network achieved 97.28% accuracy and XceptionNet achieved 97.55% accuracy, surpassing other methods on the same dataset.

Conclusion: Deep learning methods show strong potential for reliable automatic malaria detection while minimizing manual involvement.

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

*Fengyuan Sun,Hui Chen,Xinhao Xu,Dandan Zheng,Jingdong Chen,Jun Zhou,Jungong Han,Guiguang Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PruneHal is a training-free method that uses adaptive KV cache pruning to reduce hallucinations in multi-modal large language models by focusing attention on critical visual tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention to visual tokens, where redundant visual tokens disperse model attention away from informative ones.

Method: Proposes PruneHal - a training-free approach using adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance focus on critical visual information without extra training or inference costs.

Result: Evaluated on several hallucination benchmarks using four mainstream MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that demonstrate effectiveness and superiority.

Conclusion: PruneHal is the first token pruning method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs, is model-agnostic, requires no training, adds minimal inference cost, and works with various decoding strategies.

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Video Consistency Distance (VCD) to improve temporal consistency in image-to-video generation through frequency-domain analysis and reward-based fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional reward functions focus on overall video quality but fail to address temporal consistency issues in image-to-video generation tasks.

Method: Defines VCD in frequency space of video frame features to capture temporal information, then fine-tunes video diffusion models using this metric in a reward-based framework.

Result: Experimental results show VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading other performance metrics compared to previous methods.

Conclusion: VCD effectively addresses temporal consistency limitations in I2V generation while maintaining overall video quality.

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive is a synthetic data generation framework that creates multi-view photorealistic videos for autonomous driving perception tasks by decomposing videos into 3D-aware guidance maps and rendering 3D assets, significantly improving corner case detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing driving world models focus on generation quality metrics but overlook downstream perception task evaluation, which is crucial for autonomous driving performance. Current synthetic data methods require double training epochs compared to real-only baselines, making their benefits questionable.

Method: Dream4Drive decomposes input videos into 3D-aware guidance maps, renders 3D assets onto these maps, and fine-tunes a driving world model to produce edited multi-view photorealistic videos. It includes DriveObj3D, a large-scale 3D asset dataset for driving scenarios.

Result: The framework enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. Experiments show Dream4Drive effectively boosts downstream perception model performance under various training epochs.

Conclusion: Dream4Drive provides a novel approach to synthetic data generation that genuinely enhances autonomous driving perception tasks, particularly for corner cases, without requiring excessive training epochs compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: MoE-GS is a unified framework that integrates multiple specialized experts via a Volume-aware Pixel Router for dynamic Gaussian splatting, improving rendering quality while addressing efficiency through distillation and pruning techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods show inconsistent performance across diverse scenes, with no single approach effectively handling all dynamic challenges in 3D Gaussian Splatting.

Method: Proposes Mixture of Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS) with a Volume-aware Pixel Router that adaptively blends expert outputs through differentiable weight splatting. Also explores efficiency improvements via single-pass multi-expert rendering, gate-aware Gaussian pruning, and distillation to transfer MoE performance to individual experts.

Result: Extensive experiments on N3V and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency.

Conclusion: MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting, achieving superior performance while maintaining efficiency through complementary optimization strategies.

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

### [94] [SFGFusion: Surface Fitting Guided 3D Object Detection with 4D Radar and Camera Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19215)
*Xiaozhi Li,Huijun Di,Jian Li,Feng Liu,Wei Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFGFusion is a camera-4D imaging radar fusion network that uses surface fitting to enhance spatial representation and cross-modal interaction for 3D object detection in autonomous driving.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D imaging radar offers advantages like low cost and long-range detection but suffers from sparse point clouds and low resolution, limiting geometric representation and hindering multi-modal fusion with cameras.

Method: The network estimates quadratic surface parameters from image and radar data to create an explicit surface fitting model. This generates dense pseudo-point clouds to mitigate radar sparsity and guides image feature transformation from perspective view to bird's-eye view. Features from both point cloud branches are transformed to BEV space for fusion.

Result: SFGFusion achieves superior performance on TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft (VoD) object detection benchmarks, effectively fusing camera and 4D radar features.

Conclusion: The surface fitting approach successfully enhances spatial representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling reliable dense depth prediction and improving 3D object detection performance for autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Space objects in GEO are difficult to detect due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference in optical imaging.

Method: Uses wavelet transform to enhance high-frequency features and suppress background noise at single-frame level, then applies multi-frame temporal trajectory completion with Hungarian algorithm for cross-frame matching, plus post-processing steps including temporal matching, interpolation, noise filtering, and trajectory refinement.

Result: Achieved an F1 score of 90.14% on the public SpotGEO dataset, demonstrating effective detection performance.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses GEO object detection challenges through wavelet-based feature enhancement and multi-frame trajectory optimization with robust post-processing.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

*Yuheng Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Quang Tau,Zhengzhong Tu,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead is a collaborative perception framework that learns to encapsulate background context into compact foreground features, enabling effective information sharing under bandwidth constraints without transmitting background data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current collaborative perception methods discard background information when sharing foreground features due to bandwidth constraints, but background encodes essential context that improves perception reliability.

Method: Uses a curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early in training but progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into foreground representations without transmitting background itself.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks show FadeLead outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings.

Conclusion: Context-enriched foreground sharing through FadeLead's curricular learning approach effectively overcomes bandwidth limitations while maintaining essential background context for collaborative perception.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

TL;DR: This paper presents a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, focusing on 4D representations that model 3D geometry evolving over time with motion and interaction. It takes a selective approach to highlight desirable properties and challenges of different representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a unique perspective on 4D generation and reconstruction by focusing on 4D representations rather than exhaustive enumeration, helping readers select appropriate representations for their tasks.

Method: Organizes 4D representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction. Covers popular representations like NeRFs and 3DGS, as well as under-explored ones like structured models and long-range motions. Includes discussion of LLMs and VFMs in 4D applications.

Result: Provides a comprehensive survey that helps readers understand how to select and customize appropriate 4D representations for different tasks, while highlighting current limitations and available datasets.

Conclusion: The survey offers practical guidance on 4D representation selection and customization, identifies current limitations in the field, and discusses dataset availability to drive future developments in 4D generation and reconstruction.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-off between computational cost and perceptual quality in real-world image super-resolution, particularly the structural inaccuracies in one-step diffusion models caused by distillation artifacts.

Method: Enhances one-step diffusion model using ControlNet mechanism for semantic edge guidance, with hybrid loss combining L2, LPIPS, and edge-aware AME loss for pixel accuracy, perceptual quality, and geometric precision.

Result: Effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining one-step generation efficiency, achieving superior balance between output quality and inference speed.

Conclusion: The proposed framework successfully addresses structural inaccuracies in one-step diffusion models through semantic edge guidance, providing an optimal solution for real-world image super-resolution that balances quality and speed.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

TL;DR: Proposes MobiAct, a lightweight MAV action recognition framework using MobileNetV4 backbone with knowledge distillation and attention mechanisms to achieve high accuracy with low computational cost for resource-limited MAV platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MAV motion recognition approaches rely on large, computationally intensive models unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, creating a trade-off between accuracy and inference speed.

Method: Uses MobileNetV4 backbone with Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD) to transfer features from ResNet18 teacher, integrates parameter-free attention mechanism, and employs hybrid loss training strategy for stable optimization.

Result: Achieves 92.12% average accuracy across three datasets, consumes only 136.16 pJ energy, processes 8.84 actions/second, and decodes actions 2x faster than leading methods with comparable accuracy.

Conclusion: MobiAct enables low-energy, low-computation MAV action recognition with superior efficiency, making it suitable for real-time perception in autonomous aerial swarms on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing

### [100] [D2D: Detector-to-Differentiable Critic for Improved Numeracy in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19278)
*Nobline Yoo,Olga Russakovsky,Ye Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2D is a framework that transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics to improve object counting accuracy in text-to-image diffusion models without compromising image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I diffusion models struggle with generating the correct number of objects specified in prompts, and existing approaches are limited to differentiable regression-based counting networks, excluding superior detector-based models.

Method: Design custom activation functions to convert detector logits into soft binary indicators, then use these to optimize noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models.

Result: Substantial improvements in object counting accuracy across multiple benchmarks (up to 13.7% on D2D-Small), with minimal degradation in image quality and computational overhead.

Conclusion: D2D successfully bridges the gap between non-differentiable detection models and T2I generation, enabling superior counting guidance while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the

ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

TL;DR: Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL) is an efficient training algorithm that combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning to create lightweight VLMs that can compete with large-scale models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress but their large scale makes them impractical for resource-constrained environments, creating a need for efficient, lightweight alternatives.

Method: RIL combines reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning using an LLM-based discriminator to distinguish between student and teacher outputs, with guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs for diverse learning.

Result: Extensive experiments show RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and surpasses them in several instances.

Conclusion: The unified learning strategy of reinforcement and imitation enables student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs while being more resource-efficient.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

*Hai-jie Yuan,Heng Zhang,Fei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TS-GATR is a novel dynamic signature verification method that combines Graph Attention Networks and GRU to model spatial-temporal dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance with lower EER on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten signature verification is crucial for identity authentication but faces challenges due to intra-user variability and forgery risks. Existing methods struggle with modeling complex spatial-temporal relationships in dynamic signature data.

Method: TS-GATR represents signatures as graphs with dynamic features (position, velocity, pressure) and uses Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) with k-step and k-nearest neighbor graphs for local/global spatial modeling, combined with GRU for temporal dependencies.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on MSDS and DeepSignDB datasets show TS-GATR surpasses state-of-the-art approaches with consistently lower Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Conclusion: TS-GATR effectively addresses signature verification challenges by modeling both spatial and temporal dependencies through graph attention mechanisms and recurrent networks, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net is a unified multi-task framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and seabed classification from remote sensing imagery, outperforming traditional methods and single-task approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches treat depth estimation and seabed classification as isolated tasks, missing the synergistic benefits of their interaction and hindering deep learning adoption in shallow-water mapping.

Method: Uses dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and seabed classification, integrates cross-task features via Attention Feature Fusion module and windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives through dynamic task uncertainty weighting.

Result: Achieves up to 75% lower RMSE than traditional methods, reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, and improves seabed classification accuracy up to 8%. Shows enhanced spatial consistency and sharper habitat boundaries.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling depth with substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains, providing a robust solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing crowd localization approaches suffer from significant performance degradation due to scale shift (discrepancies in head scale distributions) between training and testing data in domain generalization scenarios.

Method: The authors conduct systematic examination of scale shift influence, establish ScaleBench benchmark, reproduce 20 DG algorithms, provide theoretical analysis, and propose Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) method.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate limitations of existing algorithms, reveal the importance and complexity of scale shift, and show the effectiveness of the proposed Catto method in mitigating scale shift influence.

Conclusion: The paper establishes Scale Shift Domain Generalization as a novel research direction, provides four significant insights for future research, and emphasizes the importance of addressing scale shift in crowd localization domain generalization.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP is a parameter-efficient fMRI-to-image decoder that aligns brain activity from different visual areas to corresponding CLIP layers, eliminating the need for VAE pipelines while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fMRI decoding methods that map to CLIP's final layer overlook rich object information in intermediate layers and contradict the brain's functional hierarchy. VAE-based approaches add parameter-intensive pipelines.

Method: Multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system hierarchy, aligning fMRI signals from low/high-level visual areas to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers. Uses Cross-Reconstruction strategy and multi-granularity loss.

Result: Achieves highly competitive performance, excelling on high-level semantic metrics and matching/surpassing SOTA methods using VAE pipelines. Reduces parameters by 71.7% compared to VAE-based methods.

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP effectively captures visual details missed by CLIP-only approaches, balancing semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring separate VAE pipeline, demonstrating parameter efficiency while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

TL;DR: Training-free open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition framework using EfficientNetB0 for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP for object recognition via vision-language alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a training-free approach for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition that doesn't require labeled training data.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: 1) Unsupervised segmentation using EfficientNetB0 features with SVD decomposition and hierarchical clustering, 2) Segment-level recognition using CLIP's vision-language alignment with SVD projection for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC benchmarks in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability for open-vocabulary segmentation and recognition tasks without requiring training.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: DaMo effectively addresses the challenge of determining optimal data mixtures for multitask learning in Mobile Phone Agents, demonstrating significant performance improvements, strong generalization, and scalability across various benchmarks and model architectures.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large

in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask

compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong

efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image

TL;DR: AegisRF is a framework that protects Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) intellectual property by injecting adversarial perturbations that disrupt unauthorized applications while preserving rendering quality through learnable sensitivity constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As NeRFs become powerful tools for 3D scene representation, protecting their intellectual property from unauthorized use is crucial. Existing methods avoid geometric perturbations due to quality degradation concerns.

Method: Proposes AegisRF with two components: Perturbation Field that injects adversarial perturbations into pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density), and Sensitivity Field that learns spatially varying sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations.

Result: Experimental evaluations show generalized applicability across diverse downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Conclusion: AegisRF effectively protects NeRF IP by disrupting unauthorized use through adversarial perturbations while preserving rendering quality via adaptive sensitivity constraints.

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are

TL;DR: MV-RoboBench is a new benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning in vision-language models for robotics, showing current models significantly lag human performance despite advances in single-view tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM evaluations focus on single-view settings, leaving multi-view capabilities underexplored despite multi-camera setups being standard in robotics to handle occlusion and depth ambiguity.

Method: Created MV-RoboBench with 1.7k manually curated QA items across 8 subtasks in spatial understanding and robotic execution categories, evaluating diverse VLMs including open/closed-source models and CoT-enhanced versions.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform far below human level, with key findings: (i) spatial intelligence correlates with robotic task execution in multi-view scenarios, (ii) strong single-view spatial performance doesn't translate to robotic spatial tasks.

Conclusion: MV-RoboBench reveals substantial challenges in multi-view robotic perception for VLMs and provides an open resource to foster progress in spatially grounded vision-language models and vision-language-action models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a

### [113] [Multi-Camera Worker Tracking in Logistics Warehouse Considering Wide-Angle Distortion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19432)
*Yuki Mori,Kazuma Kano,Yusuke Asai,Shin Katayama,Kenta Urano,Takuro Yonezawa,Nobuo Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-camera system using 19 wide-angle cameras to track workers in logistics warehouses, with improved accuracy through foot-position alignment to reduce distortion effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve warehouse operation efficiency through digital twins, which requires accurate worker position tracking. Single cameras have limited field of view, necessitating multi-camera systems.

Method: Used 19 ceiling-mounted wide-angle cameras looking down at warehouse floor. Aligned camera coordinates with actual positions based on floor surface. Addressed wide-angle distortion by aligning detected worker positions based on foot positions rather than full body.

Result: Achieved over 20% improvement in tracking accuracy. Compared multiple appearance feature utilization methods and validated effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: Foot-position alignment effectively reduces distortion from wide-angle cameras and enables accurate multi-camera worker tracking in warehouse environments.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

*Xueqi Ma,Yanbei Jiang,Sarah Erfani,James Bailey,Weifeng Liu,Krista A. Ehinger,Jey Han Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICK is a multi-step framework using MLLMs for psychological analysis of drawings, specifically the House-Tree-Person test, through hierarchical decomposition and knowledge injection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs excel at objective multimodal tasks but struggle with subjective, emotionally nuanced domains like psychological analysis, which remains largely unexplored.

Method: Hierarchical decomposition of drawings into sub-drawings at three levels (single-object, multi-object, whole), analysis with targeted focus, HTP knowledge base with feature extraction module trained via reinforcement learning, and integration of multi-faceted information.

Result: PICK significantly enhances MLLMs' capability in psychological analysis and is validated as a general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

Conclusion: The approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and specialized expert domains, providing a structured and interpretable framework for understanding human mental states through visual expression.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

*Hao-Chiang Shao,Chun-Hao Chang,Yu-Hsien Lin,Chia-Wen Lin,Shao-Yun Fang,Yan-Hsiu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses IC defect classification challenges in real-world scenarios with highly imbalanced data, introduces the IC-Defect-14 dataset, and proposes ReCAME-Net with multi-expert framework and specialized components to handle intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world IC defect classification faces two main challenges: extreme data imbalance due to high yield-rate requirements, and complex sample characteristics mixing class-specific and domain-related features, making existing imbalanced classifiers ineffective.

Method: Proposes ReCAME-Net with multi-expert classifier framework integrating regional channel attention module, metric learning losses, hard category mining strategy, and knowledge distillation procedure to handle intra-class diversity and inter-class similarity.

Result: ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance on general public datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses the unique challenges of real-world IC defect classification with highly imbalanced data and complex sample characteristics, demonstrating superior performance on the introduced dataset.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

*Ali Sadeghkhani,Brandon Bennett,Masoud Babaei,Arash Rabbani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-conditional GAN framework generates representative pore-scale images with controlled porosity and depth parameters, addressing subsurface heterogeneity and data scarcity challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate from core-measured values, compounded by data scarcity where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.

Method: Multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) trained on thin section samples from carbonate formations, simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a single unified model.

Result: Achieved exceptional porosity control (R^2=0.95) with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197. Generated images showed superior representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% vs 36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images.

Conclusion: The framework provides transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management where representative pore morphology is critical for digital rock physics.

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

*Juhyung Park,Rokgi Hong,Roh-Eul Yoo,Jaehyeon Koo,Se Young Chun,Seung Hong Choi,Jongho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel predictive imaging framework for accelerating MRI by using generative AI to predict target contrast images as data-driven priors for reconstructing highly under-sampled data, outperforming traditional reconstruction methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput, creating a need for faster imaging methods. The study aims to shift from traditional image reconstruction to proactive predictive imaging using generative AI capabilities.

Method: A generative model predicts target contrast images conditioned on diverse data sources (other contrast images, previously scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information). These predicted images serve as data-driven priors for reconstructing highly under-sampled MRI data. Demonstrated with two applications: FLAIR reconstruction from T1w/T2w scans, and T1w reconstruction from previous T1w scans.

Result: Evaluated on internal and multiple public datasets (14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices) with multi-channel k-space data. The prediction-prior reconstruction method significantly outperformed other approaches at high acceleration factors (x4, x8, x12), including methods with alternative or no prior information.

Conclusion: The framework introduces a fundamental shift from image reconstruction to a new paradigm of predictive imaging, demonstrating superior performance in accelerating MRI acquisition while maintaining image quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

### [118] [PRGCN: A Graph Memory Network for Cross-Sequence Pattern Reuse in 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19475)
*Zhuoyang Xie,Yibo Zhao,Hui Huang,Riwei Wang,Zan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRGCN introduces cross-sequence pattern reuse for 3D human pose estimation, using a graph memory bank to store pose prototypes and dynamically retrieve them via attention, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-based methods process sequences in isolation, failing to exploit structural regularities and repetitive motion patterns across sequences in human movement.

Method: Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network (PRGCN) with graph memory bank storing pose prototypes, attention-based retrieval, memory-driven graph convolution with anatomical constraints, and dual-stream architecture combining Mamba-based state-space models with self-attention.

Result: Achieved MPJPE of 37.1mm on Human3.6M and 13.4mm on MPI-INF-3DHP, establishing new state-of-the-art with enhanced cross-domain generalization capability.

Conclusion: Cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal for advancing 3D human pose estimation, shifting from per-sequence optimization to cumulative knowledge learning.

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

*Julia Wąsala,Joannes D. Maasakkers,Ilse Aben,Rochelle Schneider,Holger Hoos,Mitra Baratchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper addresses representation bias in methane plume detection caused by systematically missing pixels in satellite images. It evaluates imputation and resampling methods to remove spurious associations between image coverage and labels, improving detection in low-coverage images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Satellite images often have missing pixels (MNAR) due to clouds, leading to representation bias in automated feature extraction models. This causes models to associate image coverage with labels, resulting in under-detection of plumes in low-coverage images.

Method: Evaluated multiple imputation approaches and proposed a weighted resampling scheme during training that enforces class balance in each coverage bin to remove the association between label and coverage.

Result: Both resampling and imputation significantly reduced representation bias without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Debiased models showed higher chance of detecting plumes in low-coverage images in operational scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed debiasing techniques effectively address representation bias in methane plume detection from satellite images with missing data, improving detection performance particularly in challenging low-coverage conditions.

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cauvis method addresses spurious correlation issues in single-source domain generalized object detection by using cross-attention prompts and dual-branch adapters to disentangle causal-spurious features, achieving significant performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SDGOD methods suffer from models falling into spurious correlations due to domain shift and limited domain knowledge, causing over-reliance on simplistic features rather than essential domain-invariant representations.

Method: Proposes Cauvis with Cross-Attention Prompts module to mitigate bias from spurious features, and dual-branch adapter that disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via high-frequency feature extraction.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD datasets, and exhibits significant robustness advantages in complex interference environments.

Conclusion: Cauvis effectively addresses spurious correlation challenges in SDGOD through causal feature disentanglement and domain adaptation, demonstrating superior generalization capability and robustness.

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

*Moshe Kimhi,Nimrod Shabtay,Raja Giryes,Chaim Baskin,Eli Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARES is a lightweight module that predicts the minimal sufficient image resolution for VLMs, reducing compute by up to 80% while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-resolution images in VLMs inflate visual tokens to 97-99% of total tokens, causing high compute and latency even when low-resolution images would suffice.

Method: CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to extract features and predict when a target VLM's response converges to its peak ability, interpolating continuous resolutions at inference.

Result: Across five multimodal benchmarks and diverse target VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Conclusion: CARES enables efficient VLM inference by dynamically selecting minimal sufficient image resolutions without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoseCrafter improves pairwise camera pose estimation for sparsely overlapping images using hybrid video generation and feature matching selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods struggle with image pairs that have small or no overlap, and current approaches using video interpolation produce blurry frames with inefficient selection strategies.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) combining video interpolation with pose-conditioned novel view synthesis, and Feature Matching Selector (FMS) for optimal frame selection.

Result: Extensive experiments show PoseCrafter significantly enhances pose estimation performance, especially on challenging cases with small or no overlap.

Conclusion: The proposed method effectively addresses the critical challenge of camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs.

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

*Simone Alghisi,Gabriel Roccabruna,Massimo Rizzoli,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle with visual reasoning tasks like counting due to issues in mapping representations to outputs. Fine-tuning just the output layer can improve counting accuracy by up to 21%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models have limitations in visual reasoning including difficulties with spatial relations, temporal sequences, and object counting. Current evaluations focus on scores rather than understanding the underlying failure causes.

Method: Studied 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on counting tasks under controlled conditions. Conducted layer-wise analysis and performed targeted fine-tuning of just the output layer.

Result: VLMs are highly sensitive to object count, type, spatial arrangement, and distractors. Layer analysis shows errors occur in mapping last-layer representations to outputs. Fine-tuning only the output layer improved accuracy by up to 21% with consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: VLMs' counting failures stem from output mapping issues rather than representation quality. Targeted fine-tuning of the output layer is an effective and efficient approach to improve visual reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

### [124] [The Intricate Dance of Prompt Complexity, Quality, Diversity, and Consistency in T2I Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19557)
*Xiaofeng Zhang,Aaron Courville,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates how prompt complexity affects synthetic data utility from text-to-image models, finding that increased complexity reduces diversity but improves distribution alignment with real data, and that prompt expansion achieves the best performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically analyze how prompt complexity impacts the quality, diversity, and consistency of synthetic data generated by text-to-image models, as previous work has underexplored this relationship despite prompt engineering being the primary interaction method.

Method: Conducted synthetic experiments with theoretical derivations, introduced a new evaluation framework comparing real and synthetic data utility, and performed large-scale empirical analysis across CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI datasets with various inference-time intervention methods.

Result: Increasing prompt complexity leads to lower conditional diversity and prompt consistency but reduces synthetic-to-real distribution shift. Prompt expansion consistently achieves the highest performance in image diversity and aesthetics, even surpassing real data.

Conclusion: Prompt complexity significantly influences synthetic data utility, with trade-offs between diversity and distribution alignment. Current inference-time interventions can enhance diversity but may move outside real data support, while prompt expansion emerges as the most effective method.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper investigates the temporal awareness of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, revealing that temporal information forms a low-dimensional manifold in embedding space, and proposes methods to extract explicit timeline representations for temporal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess VLMs' ability to understand and position visual content in time, given their generalizable multimodal representations and open-vocabulary capabilities from large-scale training.

Method: Introduced TIME10k benchmark dataset with 10k+ temporally annotated images, evaluated 37 VLMs using novel methodology, and proposed methods to derive explicit timeline representations from embedding space based on discovered temporal manifold structure.

Result: Found temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear manifold in VLM embedding space. Timeline approaches achieved competitive to superior accuracy compared to prompt-based baselines while being computationally efficient.

Conclusion: VLMs possess structured temporal awareness that can be leveraged to create explicit timeline representations, enabling effective temporal reasoning tasks through computationally efficient methods.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

### [126] [HAD: Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation to Bridge Spatio-Temporal Gaps in Event-Based Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19560)
*Yao Deng,Xian Zhong,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu,Jingling Yuan,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAD is a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that addresses spatio-temporal asymmetries between RGB and event cameras to improve object tracking under challenging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB and event cameras have complementary strengths (texture details vs. temporal resolution/HDR), but their different imaging mechanisms create spatio-temporal asymmetries that hinder effective multi-modal integration for object tracking.

Method: Proposes Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD) with a hierarchical alignment strategy that minimizes information loss while maintaining computational efficiency and parameter compactness in the student network.

Result: Extensive experiments show HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of each component.

Conclusion: HAD successfully addresses spatio-temporal asymmetries between RGB and event cameras, enabling improved multi-modal object tracking performance.

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

### [127] [Can You Trust What You See? Alpha Channel No-Box Attacks on Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19574)
*Ariana Yi,Ce Zhou,Liyang Xiao,Qiben Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: α-Cloak is a no-box adversarial attack on object detectors that uses the alpha channel of RGBA videos to hide malicious content, achieving 100% attack success rate without model access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object detection models are widely deployed in cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles, but video-domain adversarial attacks in no-box settings remain unexplored, especially using alpha channels.

Method: Exploits alpha channel to fuse malicious target video with benign video, creating fused videos that appear normal to humans but fool object detectors. No model architecture, parameters, or outputs access required.

Result: Achieved 100% attack success rate across five state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and Gemini-2.0-Flash, with no perceptible artifacts.

Conclusion: Reveals unexplored vulnerability in video-based perception systems through alpha channel manipulation, highlighting urgent need for defenses that account for alpha channels in adversarial settings.

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

### [128] [VGD: Visual Geometry Gaussian Splatting for Feed-Forward Surround-view Driving Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19578)
*Junhong Lin,Kangli Wang,Shunzhou Wang,Songlin Fan,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VGD is a feed-forward framework for surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction that uses geometric priors from VGGT to ensure consistency and improve novel view quality through Gaussian parameter prediction and semantic refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods fail to ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views in surround-view autonomous driving due to minimal overlap regions between views.

Method: Uses a lightweight VGGT variant for geometric priors, a Gaussian Head for predicting Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, and multi-scale feature integration with semantic refinement through feature-consistent learning.

Result: Significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on nuScenes dataset in both objective metrics and subjective quality under various settings.

Conclusion: VGD demonstrates scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction by explicitly learning geometric information and using it to guide semantic quality improvement.

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

*Francisco Mena,Dino Ienco,Cassio F. Dantas,Roberto Interdonato,Andreas Dengel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-modal co-learning framework for Earth Observation that enables single-modality inference by structuring model manifolds into modality-shared and modality-specific information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in Earth Observation where access to same sensor modalities at both training and inference is complex due to real-world constraints on remote sensing platforms.

Method: Combines contrastive and modality discriminative learning to guide single-modality models to structure internal model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information.

Result: Demonstrates consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and regression tasks across different sensor modalities.

Conclusion: Validates the framework's effectiveness in single-modality inference scenarios across diverse EO applications.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most uncertainty estimation research focuses on scene understanding or medical imaging, leaving a gap for remote sensing applications. Semantic segmentation uncertainty presents unique challenges requiring scalable per-pixel estimates.

Method: Extensive evaluation using Stochastic Segmentation Networks and ensembles with various neural architectures and uncertainty metrics on two remote sensing datasets (PASTIS and ForTy) that differ in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence.

Result: The study provides practical recommendations based on findings about which uncertainty estimation methods work best for identifying prediction errors and noise-corrupted regions in satellite imagery segmentation.

Conclusion: The paper establishes benchmarks and practical guidance for uncertainty estimation in remote sensing semantic segmentation, addressing the specific needs of Earth observation applications.

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

both clinical and research applications. The framework is validated on 37,191

*Su Ho Han,Jeongseok Hyun,Pilhyeon Lee,Minho Shim,Dongyoon Wee,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecAF is a training-free method that converts MLLM attention maps into video segmentation masks through decomposed attention fusion and SAM2 prompting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable video reasoning segmentation without retraining by refining noisy attention maps from multimodal large language models for better object localization.

Method: Proposes Decomposed Attention Fusion with contrastive object-background fusion and complementary video-frame fusion, plus attention-guided SAM2 prompting for fine-grained masks.

Result: Outperforms training-free methods and achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on referring and reasoning VOS benchmarks.

Conclusion: DecAF demonstrates effective training-free video segmentation by refining MLLM attention maps through decomposition and fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at
https://github.com/HYUNJS/DecAF.

### [134] [CBDiff:Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Models for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19597)
*Zhou Lei,Pan Gang,Wang Jiahao,Sun Di*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CBDiff introduces a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model for Image Forgery Localization that generates multiple diverse localization maps instead of single deterministic predictions, addressing uncertainty in tampered regions through Bernoulli noise and time-step cross-attention mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IFL methods produce single deterministic localization maps that lack precision and reliability for high-stakes applications like forensic analysis and security surveillance. There's a need to enhance prediction credibility and mitigate error risks by accounting for uncertainty in tampered regions.

Method: CBDiff uses a Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model that generates multiple diverse localization maps. It incorporates Bernoulli noise to reflect binary and sparse properties of forgery masks, and introduces Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention) to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps for improved manipulation detection.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in Image Forgery Localization performance.

Conclusion: CBDiff shows strong potential for real-world deployment by providing more comprehensive forgery distribution representations and addressing the inherent uncertainty and variability in tampered regions.

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper presents XBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability of vision-language models in chest X-rays, revealing limitations in reliable grounding for medical applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models show strong zero-shot medical image understanding but their grounding ability (alignment between textual concepts and visual evidence) remains underexplored, which is essential for clinical interpretability and adoption.

Method: Generated visual explanations using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and quantitatively assessed their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across multiple pathologies using seven CLIP-style VLM variants.

Result: (1) VLMs perform well for large/well-defined pathologies but degrade substantially for small/diffuse lesions; (2) Chest X-ray-specific pretraining improves alignment; (3) Recognition ability and grounding ability are strongly correlated.

Conclusion: Current VLMs fall short in clinically reliable grounding despite strong recognition ability, highlighting the need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before medical deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

### [136] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper introduces a denoising estimator using scattering coefficients that achieves minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images with unknown Lipschitz exponents α≤2, bridging harmonic analysis and deep learning approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional sparse estimators in frames (wavelets, curvelets) are suboptimal for cartoon images with unknown Lipschitz regularity α≤2, while deep neural networks show better performance but lack mathematical understanding.

Method: Joint minimization and maximization of ℓ¹ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients, which are computed by applying a second wavelet transform to the modulus of wavelet coefficients.

Result: Numerical experiments show the denoising estimator reaches minimax asymptotic bounds for cartoon images across all Lipschitz exponents α≤2, though this is stated as a mathematical conjecture.

Conclusion: The approach provides a new harmonic analysis method for noise suppression and geometric regularity specification, creating a mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and deep convolutional network denoising.

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenComm enables seamless perception across heterogeneous multi-agent systems through feature generation without altering original networks, achieving 81% reduction in computational cost and parameters when adding new agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for multi-agent collaboration fail in heterogeneous settings due to intrusive retraining that disrupts semantic consistency and high computational costs when accommodating new agents, limiting scalability.

Method: Uses Generative Communication with Deformable Message Extractor to extract spatial messages, Spatial-Aware Feature Generator with conditional diffusion model to generate aligned features, and Channel Enhancer for refinement before fusion.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods on OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets, with 81% reduction in computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents.

Conclusion: GenComm provides a practical solution for heterogeneous multi-agent collaboration that maintains semantic consistency while enabling scalable integration of new agents with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

*Zhengxuan Wei,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR is a zero-external-dependency framework that addresses moment retrieval bottlenecks through data augmentation and two-stage training with cold-start curriculum learning and distillation adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three critical bottlenecks in moment retrieval: data scarcity forcing shallow keyword associations, boundary ambiguity in transition regions, and insufficient discrimination of fine-grained semantics.

Method: Two-stage training framework: (1) Cold-start stage with curriculum learning on augmented data for foundational boundary/semantic awareness, (2) Distillation stage with dual query sets (Original Queries for DETR-based localization and Active Queries for real-data adaptation) and cross-stage distillation loss.

Result: AMR achieves improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed AMR framework effectively resolves boundary ambiguity and semantic confusion without additional data, preserving discriminative capabilities while enabling real-world generalization.

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedReason-R1 is a medical vision-language model that improves CT disease diagnosis by incorporating explicit reasoning processes and zoom-in disease regions, achieving state-of-the-art performance without costly manual annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General-purpose VLMs perform poorly in medical domains due to lack of specialized datasets and neglect of diagnostic processes that progress from coarse to fine-grained analysis.

Method: Created CT-RATE-VQA dataset (84K QA pairs) and developed MedReason-R1 with explicit reasoning, embedding zoom-in disease ROI areas into images, and using GRPO reinforcement learning framework.

Result: MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in CT disease diagnosis while maintaining generalization capabilities, outperforming both general-purpose and medical VLMs.

Conclusion: The proposed approach effectively addresses medical VLM limitations through specialized datasets and explicit reasoning processes, demonstrating significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-GS struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction artifacts like local blurring and needle-shape distortions, caused by gradient magnitude dilution and primitive frozen phenomenon where Gaussian densification gets inhibited.

Method: ReAct-GS uses: (1) importance-aware densification criterion with α-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to reactivate stalled primitive growth, and (2) reactivation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive parameter perturbations.

Result: Comprehensive experiments show ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on novel view synthesis metrics while preserving geometric details. The method also improves other 3D-GS variants like Pixel-GS.

Conclusion: The reactivation mechanism successfully addresses fundamental limitations in 3D-GS and demonstrates broad applicability across different Gaussian splatting variants.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

*Zhida Zhao,Talas Fu,Yifan Wang,Lijun Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Policy World Model (PWM) integrates world modeling and trajectory planning in autonomous driving, using action-free future state forecasting and collaborative state-action prediction to improve planning reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving world models are mostly used for simulation and decoupled from planning, lacking synergistic integration between world modeling and trajectory planning.

Method: Proposes PWM with action-free future state forecasting, collaborative state-action prediction, dynamically enhanced parallel token generation, context-guided tokenizer, and adaptive dynamic focal loss.

Result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art approaches using only front camera input, outperforming methods that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Conclusion: PWM successfully integrates world modeling and planning, demonstrating human-like anticipatory perception and reliable planning performance with efficient video forecasting.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

*John Burden,Jonathan Prunty,Ben Slater,Matthieu Tehenan,Greg Davis,Lucy Cheke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper adapts visual search paradigms from cognitive psychology to test if multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit human-like "pop-out" effects and capacity limits in visual processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box evaluations of MLLMs focus on task accuracy but reveal little about underlying visual processing mechanisms. The authors want to understand if MLLMs process visual information in ways similar to human perception.

Method: Used controlled visual search experiments targeting color, size and lighting features, adapting classic cognitive psychology paradigms. Also employed targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic interpretability analyses.

Result: Advanced MLLMs show human-like pop-out effects in color or size-based disjunctive search, capacity limits for conjunctive search, and incorporate natural scene priors like lighting direction into object representations.

Conclusion: Visual search serves as a cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in MLLMs, revealing similarities between MLLM and human visual processing mechanisms.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CST is a framework that preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired image-to-image translation in medical imaging by integrating structure consistency into training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing unpaired image translation methods often distort fine curvilinear structures like microvasculature, which undermines diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis in medical imaging.

Method: CST augments baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological supervision, integrating structure consistency into training. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods like CycleGAN and UNSB.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities (OCT angiography, color fundus, and X-ray coronary angiography) shows CST improves translation fidelity and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging by reinforcing geometric integrity in learned mappings.

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

*Rashik Shadman,M G Sarwar Murshed,Faraz Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Ensemble-CAM technique is proposed to provide visual explanations for deep learning-based face presentation attack detection systems, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Presentation attacks using fake biometric data pose serious security threats, and while DL-based PAD systems are effective, they function as black boxes with opaque decisions. Explainability techniques are needed to understand model behavior and identify key regions that determine if biometric images are real or fake.

Method: Proposed Ensemble-CAM technique for generating visual explanations of DL-based face PAD system decisions, aiming to identify the key regions that influence classification as real or fake.

Result: The method provides visual explanations that help understand the behavior of DL-based face PAD systems, though specific quantitative results are not detailed in the abstract.

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM enhances transparency and trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems by providing better understanding of their decision-making process through visual explanations.

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

*Kuai Yu,Crystal Su,Xiang Liu,Judah Goldfeder,Mingyuan Shao,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LyTimeT is a two-phase framework that extracts interpretable dynamical variables from videos using spatio-temporal attention and stability constraints, achieving robust latent representations and accurate long-term predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extracting true dynamical variables from high-dimensional video is challenging due to distracting visual factors like background motion, occlusions, and texture changes that obscure the underlying dynamics.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase 1 uses a TimeSformer-based autoencoder with global attention to focus on dynamically relevant regions. Phase 2 probes the latent space, selects meaningful dimensions via linear correlation, and refines dynamics with Lyapunov-based stability regularization.

Result: Achieves best mutual information and intrinsic dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background perturbations, and delivers lowest analytical mean squared error compared to CNN-based and transformer-only baselines across synthetic and real-world systems.

Conclusion: Combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields predictive models that are both accurate and physically interpretable for extracting dynamical variables from video data.

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ADQ is a mixed-precision quantization framework that addresses non-uniform activation distribution and static weight codebooks through adaptive weight quantization with quantile-based initialization, online codebook adaptation, and sensitivity-informed mixed-precision allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing QAT methods face challenges with highly non-uniform activation distributions and static, mismatched codebooks in weight quantization, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Method: Proposes Adaptive Distribution-aware Quantization (ADQ) with: 1) quantile-based initialization for codebook alignment, 2) EMA-based online codebook adaptation for dynamic tracking, 3) sensitivity-informed mixed-precision allocation, and 4) hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping for activations.

Result: On ImageNet, ADQ achieves 71.512% Top-1 accuracy for ResNet-18 with average 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies on CIFAR-10 validate individual component contributions.

Conclusion: ADQ effectively addresses key quantization challenges through adaptive distribution-aware techniques, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency for deep neural network deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMotion-X is a unified multimodal framework for whole-body human motion generation using autoregressive diffusion transformers, supporting diverse tasks like text-to-motion, music-to-dance, and speech-to-gesture with enhanced consistency and control.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the need for versatile and consistent whole-body human motion generation across multiple modalities and tasks in a unified framework, overcoming limitations of existing specialized approaches.

Method: Uses autoregressive diffusion transformer in sequence-to-sequence manner with reference motion conditioning and progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. Constructs OmniMoCap-X dataset with 28 MoCap sources standardized to SMPL-X format and GPT-4o generated hierarchical captions.

Conclusion: OmniMotion-X provides a comprehensive solution for versatile multimodal human motion generation with superior performance and enhanced consistency through unified framework design and large-scale dataset construction.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

TL;DR: CPL-NC is a lightweight test-time adaptation framework for Vision-Language Models that addresses prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between similar classes through class-aware prototype caching and negative contrastive learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs suffer performance drops when deployment distribution diverges from training, and existing TTA methods fail to address prototype degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically similar classes.

Method: Uses Class-Aware Prototype Cache Module with dynamic capacity adjustment and rejuvenation mechanism, plus Negative Contrastive Learning Mechanism to constrain hard negatives. Employs asymmetric optimization refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.

Result: Outperforms prior TTA methods across 15 benchmarks on both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: CPL-NC effectively enhances VLM generalization under distribution shifts by addressing key challenges of prototype degradation and class confusion through lightweight test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

Conclusion: The paper addresses the standardization gap in monocular depth evaluation by providing new metrics and tools that better capture human-perceptible errors, particularly for curvature-related distortions.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how

their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing

Method: Using optimal transport to align sentences in multilingual news articles, applied to 140,000+ pairs of Bloomberg English and Japanese news articles covering 3500 Tokyo stocks from 2012-2024.

Result: Aligned sentences are sparser, more interpretable, and show higher semantic similarity. Return scores from aligned sentences have stronger correlations with stock returns, and trading strategies achieve 10% higher Sharpe ratios.

Conclusion: Optimal transport-based sentence alignment improves cross-lingual news analysis and enhances financial trading strategy performance.

Abstract: News spreads rapidly across languages and regions, but translations may lose
subtle nuances. We propose a method to align sentences in multilingual news
articles using optimal transport, identifying semantically similar content
across languages. We apply this method to align more than 140,000 pairs of
Bloomberg English and Japanese news articles covering around 3500 stocks in
Tokyo exchange over 2012-2024. Aligned sentences are sparser, more
interpretable, and exhibit higher semantic similarity. Return scores
constructed from aligned sentences show stronger correlations with realized
stock returns, and long-short trading strategies based on these alignments
achieve 10\% higher Sharpe ratios than analyzing the full text sample.

TL;DR: The paper examines how people interact with LLMs for health questions and finds that proactive context-seeking by AI improves conversational dynamics and user satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenges of navigating health information using LLMs, which can provide tailored information but risk being inaccurate or misleading.

Method: Conducted 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), including qualitative research and a randomized blinded study comparing a "Wayfinding AI" that proactively solicits context with a baseline AI.

Result: Participants rated the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns compared to baseline AI. Context-seeking was valued even when it delayed answers.

Conclusion: Proactive context-seeking significantly impacts conversational dynamics and suggests design patterns for conversational AI to better navigate health topics.

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information
landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible
information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present
insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people
interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed
the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific
details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs
was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several
turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to
proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated
the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns
compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of
proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design
patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

Motivation: Address critical data scarcity hindering practical deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical
deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a
context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate
expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the
efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to
generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to
enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment
results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these
synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the
data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this
work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for
human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate

TL;DR: Performance evaluation of MLX framework for transformer model inference on Apple silicon devices, comparing with PyTorch on NVIDIA GPU.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for frameworks that can deploy LLMs on smaller devices like laptops and mobile phones, taking advantage of on-device hardware.

Method: Created MLX-transformers framework with transformer implementations in MLX, converted PyTorch checkpoints to MLX format, benchmarked BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa models on Apple Silicon MacBooks vs NVIDIA CUDA GPU.

Result: MLX shows potential for efficient on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem, enabling seamless execution of transformer models from Hugging Face.

Conclusion: MLX demonstrates capability for enabling efficient and accessible on-device machine learning applications on Apple silicon devices.

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

### [158] [BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18927)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BAPO addresses RL optimization challenges in off-policy settings by dynamically adjusting clipping bounds to balance positive/negative contributions and preserve entropy, achieving state-of-the-art performance on language model benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL is crucial for aligning LLMs but faces challenges in off-policy settings: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization becomes unstable, and may collapse due to negative-advantage sample dominance and fixed clipping mechanisms blocking entropy-increasing updates.

Method: Proposed BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO) - dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization.

Result: BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training across diverse off-policy scenarios. 7B model surpasses open-source counterparts like SkyWork-OR1-7B, and 32B model achieves SOTA results, outperforming proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking on AIME 2024/2025 benchmarks.

Conclusion: BAPO effectively addresses RL optimization challenges in off-policy settings through adaptive clipping, enabling stable training and superior performance compared to both open-source and proprietary systems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

### [159] [MetaCluster: Enabling Deep Compression of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19105)
*Matthew Raffel,Adwaith Renjith,Lizhong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster is a framework that compresses Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) by using a meta-learner to map embeddings to coefficient vectors, clustering them via K-means, and replacing per-edge vectors with shared centroids, achieving up to 80x parameter reduction without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs replace scalar weights with per-edge vectors of basis coefficients, increasing expressivity but also significantly multiplying parameters and memory usage, creating a need for efficient compression methods.

Method: A lightweight meta-learner is trained jointly with the KAN to map low-dimensional embeddings to coefficient vectors, shaping them onto a low-dimensional manifold. K-means clustering is then applied in coefficient space, replacing per-edge vectors with shared centroids. The meta-learner is discarded after clustering, and the centroid codebook is fine-tuned to recover any accuracy loss.

Result: On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets, across standard KANs and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves up to 80x reduction in parameter storage with no loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: MetaCluster effectively compresses KANs by exploiting the vector nature of their parameters through clustering and shared centroids, enabling significant parameter reduction while maintaining model accuracy across various benchmarks.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

*Zhi Zhang,Yixian Shen,Congfeng Cao,Ekaterina Shutova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroAda is a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that combines selective parameter adaptation with bypass connections to achieve fine-grained adaptation while maintaining high memory efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the trade-off between addition-based methods (memory efficient but limited representational capacity) and selective in-situ adaptation (precise adaptation but high memory consumption).

Method: First identifies important parameters like selective adaptation, then introduces bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the bypass connections are updated while original model parameters remain frozen.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on 23+ tasks with ≤0.02% trainable parameters, reducing CUDA memory usage by up to 60%.

Conclusion: NeuroAda successfully enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory efficiency, outperforming existing PEFT methods.

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Enhanced Species Distribution Modeling for frogs using deep learning and data imputation techniques, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy through data balancing and multimodal ensemble approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations in traditional species monitoring methods by improving Species Distribution Modeling accuracy for biodiversity conservation, especially when dealing with sparse or incomplete data.

Method: Applied deep learning and data imputation techniques, used data balancing to handle class imbalance, performed feature selection to identify key environmental factors, and developed a multimodal ensemble model integrating land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs.

Result: Data balancing reduced MAE from 189 to 29 in frog counting; multimodal ensemble model achieved 84.9% accuracy with AUC of 0.90; model showed robust generalization across unseen regions and outperformed individual models.

Conclusion: Multimodal learning combined with data preprocessing techniques like balancing and imputation can significantly improve ecological modeling accuracy, enabling more precise and scalable biodiversity monitoring despite data limitations.

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

TL;DR: The Ring-linear model series introduces hybrid attention architectures that combine linear and softmax attention, achieving significant reductions in inference costs while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the high I/O and computational overhead in long-context inference scenarios by developing more efficient attention mechanisms that reduce costs while maintaining performance.

Method: Developed Ring-mini-linear-2.0 (16B parameters) and Ring-flash-linear-2.0 (104B parameters) with hybrid attention architecture combining linear and softmax attention. Systematically explored attention mechanism ratios and used self-developed FP8 operator library (linghe) for efficiency improvements.

Result: Reduced inference cost to 1/10 compared to 32B dense models and over 50% reduction compared to original Ring series. Achieved 50% training efficiency improvement. Maintained SOTA performance across multiple complex reasoning benchmarks through stable RL optimization.

Conclusion: The hybrid attention architecture successfully balances efficiency and performance, demonstrating that systematic optimization of attention mechanisms can achieve substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

*Kemou Li,Qizhou Wang,Yue Wang,Fengpeng Li,Jun Liu,Bo Han,Jiantao Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper identifies a 'squeezing effect' in language model unlearning where probability mass shifts to semantically related rephrasings, proposes a bootstrapping framework that suppresses both target responses and model beliefs to achieve more thorough forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning methods using gradient ascent cause probability mass to redistribute into semantically related rephrasings of target responses, leading to spurious unlearning that automated metrics often misreport as successful.

Method: Proposes a bootstrapping (BS) framework that explicitly links the squeezing effect with model beliefs, jointly suppressing both target responses and model beliefs through BS-T (token-level) and BS-S (sequence-level) approaches.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the approach achieves more thorough forgetting while preserving utility compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The bootstrapping framework effectively counters the squeezing effect in language model unlearning by incorporating model beliefs into the unlearning objective, enabling more comprehensive forgetting of sensitive content.

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: Diffusion Caching is a training-free, architecture-agnostic method that reduces computational overhead in diffusion models by reusing intrinsic computational redundancies through feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models suffer from prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency due to multi-step iterations and complex backbone networks, creating bottlenecks for real-time applications. Existing acceleration techniques face limitations in applicability, training costs, or quality degradation.

Method: Diffusion Caching identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in the diffusion process through feature-level cross-step reuse and inter-layer scheduling. It evolves from static reuse to dynamic prediction, enabling caching flexibility across diverse tasks and integration with other acceleration techniques.

Result: The method reduces computation without modifying model parameters and can be integrated with sampling optimization and model distillation techniques. It provides a unified framework for efficient inference in multimodal and interactive applications.

Conclusion: Diffusion Caching will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of Efficient Generative Intelligence by providing a training-free, architecture-agnostic acceleration paradigm.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

*Anand Choudhary,Yasser Sulaıman,Lukas Mauch,Ghouthi Boukli Hacene,Fabien Cardinaux,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP is a sparse fine-tuning method that selectively tunes parameters with large gradients on downstream tasks but small pre-trained magnitudes, improving performance while reducing catastrophic forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse fine-tuning techniques need optimal parameter selection to be effective. The goal is to prioritize task-relevant parameters while minimizing disruption to pre-trained knowledge.

Method: GaLLoP fine-tunes parameters that have the largest gradient magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes, focusing on highly task-relevant but minimally disruptive parameters.

Result: Experiments with LLaMA3 8B and Gemma 2B show GaLLoP consistently improves or matches performance of other PEFT techniques (LoRA, DoRA, SAFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, while mitigating catastrophic forgetting and task data memorization.

Conclusion: GaLLoP stabilizes performance, robustly generalizes across random seeds, and maintains pre-trained knowledge by keeping important parameters unchanged, making it an effective sparse fine-tuning approach.

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

*Rohith Kuditipudi,Jing Huang,Sally Zhu,Diyi Yang,Christopher Potts,Percy Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether Alice can prove Bob is using her language model by testing for statistical dependence between Bob's model/text and the randomized training order of Alice's model, using palimpsestic memorization as evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if model creators can detect unauthorized use of their models by others, addressing intellectual property protection in open-weight language models.

Method: Formulates the problem as independence testing using palimpsestic memorization. In query setting: estimates likelihoods of training examples via prompting and correlates with training order. In observational setting: uses two approaches - text overlap with training data and likelihood comparison with retrained models.

Result: In query setting: achieved p-values ≤1e-8 for most fine-tunes across Pythia and OLMo models (1B-12B parameters). In observational setting: second approach reliably detects with few hundred tokens; first approach requires hundreds of thousands of tokens.

Conclusion: The proposed statistical framework can effectively detect unauthorized model usage through palimpsestic memorization, with different approaches suitable for query vs. observational settings.

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: StutterZero and StutterFormer are the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting transcriptions, achieving significant improvements over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, but current automatic speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances. Existing methods use multi-stage pipelines that separate transcription from audio reconstruction and amplify distortions.

Method: StutterZero uses convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with attention, while StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both are trained on paired stuttered-fluent data from SEP-28K and LibriStutter corpora.

Result: StutterZero achieved 24% decrease in Word Error Rate and 31% improvement in semantic similarity compared to Whisper-Medium. StutterFormer performed even better with 28% decrease in WER and 34% improvement in BERTScore.

Conclusion: The results validate the feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic
speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them
accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature
extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech
(TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and
often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer,
the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert
stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription.
StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with
attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with
shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on
paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter
corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across
all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a
31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading
Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%
decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the
feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering
new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and
accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: ColorAgent is an OS agent that enables long-horizon, robust interactions with mobile environments through reinforcement learning and multi-agent framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Android benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With advancements in hardware, software, and LLMs, human-OS interaction is evolving from command-line to AI agents. The goal is to build an OS agent that can execute user instructions faithfully and become a collaborative partner rather than just an automation tool.

Method: Uses step-wise reinforcement learning and self-evolving training for long-horizon interactions. Develops a tailored multi-agent framework for generality, consistency, and robustness. Explores personalized user intent recognition and proactive engagement.

Result: Achieved 77.2% success rate on AndroidWorld and 50.7% on AndroidLab benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Current benchmarks are insufficient for comprehensive OS agent evaluation. Future work should focus on evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security aspects.

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model
technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved
from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions.
Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions
and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical
report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,
robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and
proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the
environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise
reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a
tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and
robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent
recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an
automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on
the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%
and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we
note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of
OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly
in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our

TL;DR: AutoPage is a multi-agent system that automates the creation of interactive project webpages from research papers through a hierarchical pipeline, addressing hallucination with verification agents and human oversight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers spend significant time manually creating project webpages to make dense papers accessible. While automation exists for static content, dynamic interactive webpages remain a challenge.

Method: AutoPage uses a multi-agent system with coarse-to-fine pipeline: narrative planning, multimodal content generation, and interactive rendering. It includes "Checker" agents to verify against source papers and optional human checkpoints.

Result: AutoPage generates high-quality, visually appealing pages in under 15 minutes for less than $0.1, as validated by the PageBench benchmark.

Conclusion: AutoPage transforms from a mere tool into a collaborative assistant that efficiently automates webpage creation while maintaining accuracy and alignment with author vision.

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency
in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at
$\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

### [170] [$\nabla$-SDF: Learning Euclidean Signed Distance Functions Online with Gradient-Augmented Octree Interpolation and Neural Residual](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18999)
*Zhirui Dai,Qihao Qian,Tianxing Fan,Nikolay Atanasov*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ∇-SDF is a hybrid method combining explicit gradient-augmented octree interpolation with implicit neural residual for efficient, differentiable, and non-truncated SDF reconstruction from point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SDF reconstruction methods face trade-offs: volumetric methods lack differentiability and continuity, while neural methods are inefficient, suffer from catastrophic forgetting, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs in large environments.

Method: Combines explicit prior from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with implicit neural residual, creating a hybrid approach that leverages strengths of both volumetric and neural methods.

Result: Achieves non-truncated Euclidean SDF reconstruction with computational/memory efficiency comparable to volumetric methods and differentiability/accuracy comparable to neural methods, outperforming state-of-the-art in accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: ∇-SDF provides a scalable solution for robotics and computer vision tasks by offering the best of both worlds - efficiency of volumetric methods and differentiability/accuracy of neural methods.

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

*Matteo Bortolon,Nuno Ferreira Duarte,Plinio Moreno,Fabio Poiesi,José Santos-Victor,Alessio Del Bue*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRASPLAT is a novel grasping framework that uses RGB images and 3D Gaussian Splatting to predict successful grasp poses for multi-fingered robotic hands, achieving significant improvements over existing image-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing grasping methods rely on complete 3D scans which are difficult to acquire in real-world scenarios, creating a need for approaches that can work with more accessible RGB data while maintaining 3D understanding.

Method: The framework synthesizes physically plausible images of hand-object interactions using 3D Gaussian Splatting, then regresses hand joints for successful grasps. It incorporates photometric loss to refine predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9% over existing image-based methods.

Conclusion: GRASPLAT demonstrates that effective dexterous grasping can be achieved using only RGB images by leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-fidelity view synthesis and photometric refinement.

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

TL;DR: GigaBrain-0 is a Vision-Language-Action foundation model that uses world model-generated data to reduce reliance on expensive real robot data while improving cross-task generalization and policy robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the challenge of expensive and time-consuming collection of real-world robot data for training VLA models, which limits scalability and generalization capacity.

Method: Leverages world model-generated data (video generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real transfer) and improves policy robustness through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought supervision.

Result: Achieves superior generalization across variations in appearances, object placements, and camera viewpoints, with substantial gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving cross-task generalization, and an optimized lightweight variant (GigaBrain-0-Small) is presented for efficient deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, there is a critical need to safeguard them against unsafe, malicious, or privacy-violating content to ensure responsible AI deployment.

Method: Uses a unified large model for content-safety and model-manipulation detection, and a separate lightweight NER pipeline (Presidio-style models or regex-based detectors) for data-leakage identification and redaction. Can be deployed as a security gateway or API-based service.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety benchmarks, excelling in both prompt and response classification across English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks.

Conclusion: OpenGuardrails provides enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options and all models are released under Apache 2.0 license for public use, offering comprehensive AI safety protection.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, safeguarding them against unsafe, malicious, or
privacy-violating content is critically important. We present OpenGuardrails,
the first open-source project to provide both a context-aware safety and
manipulation detection model and a deployable platform for comprehensive AI
guardrails. OpenGuardrails protects against content-safety risks,
model-manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking,
code-interpreter abuse, and the generation/execution of malicious code), and
data leakage. Content-safety and model-manipulation detection are implemented
by a unified large model, while data-leakage identification and redaction are
performed by a separate lightweight NER pipeline (e.g., Presidio-style models
or regex-based detectors). The system can be deployed as a security gateway or
an API-based service, with enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options.
OpenGuardrails achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on safety

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing data volumes make protecting sensitive information challenging, especially when sharing with multiple users having different roles and permissions.

Method: Integrates four modules: automated sensitive region detection, post-correction, key management, and access control. Uses hybrid encryption (symmetric for efficiency + Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement) with isolated key storage.

Result: Effective PSO detection with 5% increase in macro-averaged F1 score and 10% increase in mean Average Precision. Average policy-enforced decryption time <1 second per image.

Conclusion: The system demonstrates effectiveness, efficiency and scalability for fine-grained access control in data sharing scenarios.

Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting
sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly
challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles
and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data
sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of
sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture
integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive
regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions
are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for
efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system
supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen
overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on
visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically
detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data
repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO
detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision
(10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1
second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.

Motivation: To evaluate LLMs' ability to assess clinical trial reporting according to CONSORT standards and understand their cognitive and reasoning strategies in healthcare applications.

Method: Applied behavioral and metacognitive analysis with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two representative LLMs under three different prompt conditions.

Result: Clear differences emerged in how models approached CONSORT items and prompt types, with variations in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty expression, and alternative interpretations shaping response patterns.

Conclusion: Current LLMs have limitations in clinical compliance automation, highlighting the need to understand their cognitive adaptations and strategic behavior for developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,

### [176] [The Zero-Step Thinking: An Empirical Study of Mode Selection as Harder Early Exit in Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19176)
*Yuqiao Tan,Shizhu He,Kang Liu,Jun Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Mode Selection is identified as a more challenging variant of Early Exit for reasoning models, requiring decision-making at the start of reasoning using zero-step thinking rather than during inference, with current methods showing limitations in handling limited information scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the computational overhead caused by overthinking in reasoning models, where step-by-step thinking leads to unnecessary computational burden.

Method: Proposes Mode Selection as an approach that decides between Long-CoT or Short-CoT using Thinking or No-Thinking modes at the beginning of reasoning, relying on pre-defined fake thoughts without explicit reasoning (zero-step thinking).

Result: Empirical studies on nine baselines show prompt-based approaches fail due to limited classification capabilities, while internal information approaches perform better but lack stability. Existing methods are insufficient for effective Mode Selection in limited information scenarios.

Conclusion: Mode Selection presents ongoing challenges as existing methods relying solely on model information are inadequate for handling this task effectively, particularly in scenarios with limited information.

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code

### [177] [Memo: Training Memory-Efficient Embodied Agents with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19732)
*Gunshi Gupta,Karmesh Yadav,Zsolt Kira,Yarin Gal,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo is a transformer-based architecture for RL that creates and retrieves memory using periodic summarization tokens, enabling efficient handling of long-horizon tasks while being more compute and storage efficient than naive long-context transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transformer-based policies for embodied agents struggle with visual inputs overwhelming context limits, while humans can maintain compressed lifetime memories. Existing approaches either use recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with full-context reliance, lacking efficient memory compression.

Method: Proposes Memo architecture that incorporates memory creation and retrieval by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with model inputs during training, enabling efficient memory management for long-horizon tasks.

Result: Memo outperforms naive long-context transformer baselines on gridworld meta-RL and multi-object navigation tasks, while being more compute and storage efficient. It also generalizes better to longer contexts and remains robust in streaming settings with truncated historical context.

Conclusion: Memo provides an effective transformer-based solution for memory-intensive RL tasks, addressing the limitations of current approaches by enabling efficient memory compression and retrieval while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

*Yiqian Yang,Tian Lan,Qianghuai Jia,Li Zhu,Hui Jiang,Hang Zhu,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSCodeComp is a new benchmark for evaluating deep search agents on hierarchical rule application, specifically for predicting 10-digit Harmonized System Codes from product descriptions. Current agents perform poorly (46.8% accuracy) compared to human experts (95.0%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks overlook the critical capability of applying complex rules with vague boundaries and implicit logic relationships, which is essential for real-world applications like legal clauses, medical manuals, and tariff rules.

Method: Created HSCodeComp benchmark using real-world e-commerce data with 632 product entries spanning diverse categories, annotated by human experts. Evaluated various state-of-the-art LLMs and agents on predicting 10-digit HSCodes from noisy product descriptions.

Result: Best agent achieved only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, significantly below human expert performance of 95.0%. Test-time scaling failed to improve performance, highlighting the challenges of hierarchical rule application.

Conclusion: There is a substantial performance gap between current AI agents and human experts in hierarchical rule application tasks, indicating the need for improved methods to handle complex rule-based reasoning in deep search agents.

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.
