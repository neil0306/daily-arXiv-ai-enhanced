While recent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a promising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a variety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich conceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they exhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the phrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is due to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are trained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore this linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors superficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but important aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and tends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more local. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders (T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent activations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet powerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic features in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models, T-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing reconstruction quality.

Meanwhile, fine-tuning remains the default operation for adapting LLMs to new domains and tasks. Despite their widespread adoption, these two post-training interventions have been studied in isolation, leaving open a crucial question: if we fine-tune an edited model, do the edits survive? This question is motivated by two practical scenarios: removing covert or malicious edits, and preserving beneficial edits. If fine-tuning impairs edits as shown in Figure 1, current KE methods become less useful, as every fine-tuned model would require re-editing, which significantly increases the cost; if edits persist, fine-tuned models risk propagating hidden malicious edits, raising serious safety concerns. To this end, we systematically quantify edits decay after fine-tuning, investigating how fine-tuning affects knowledge editing. We evaluate two state-of-the-art editing methods (MEMIT, AlphaEdit) and three fine-tuning approaches (full-parameter, LoRA, DoRA) across five LLMs and three datasets, yielding 232 experimental configurations. Our results show that edits decay after fine-tuning, with survival varying across configurations, e.g., AlphaEdit edits decay more than MEMIT edits. Further, we propose selective-layer fine-tuning and find that fine-tuning edited layers only can effectively remove edits, though at a slight cost to downstream performance.

However, such a cascaded pipeline fails to leverage the feedback from both steps for mutual refinement, and, meanwhile, the embedding-only clustering overlooks nuanced textual semantics, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes NILC, a novel clustering framework specially catered for effective NID. Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering assignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and text embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models (LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic centroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the Euclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment hard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via rewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision signals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more accurate NID in the semi-supervised setting.

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text.

However, the Mambaout model and its variants prove that the SSM module, which is the core component of the Mamba model, is unnecessary for the vision task. Therefore, we hope to prove the feasibility of using the Mambaout-based module to remotely learn the heart rate. Specifically, we propose a novel rPPG algorithm called uncomplicated and enhanced learning capability rPPG (TYrPPG). This paper introduces an innovative gated video understanding block (GVB) designed for efficient analysis of RGB videos. Based on the Mambaout structure, this block integrates 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN to enhance video understanding for analysis. In addition, we propose a comprehensive supervised loss function (CSL) to improve the model's learning capability, along with its weakly supervised variants. The experiments show that our TYrPPG can achieve state-of-the-art performance in commonly used datasets, indicating its prospects and superiority in remote heart rate estimation.

The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories.

This entire process operates in a textual gradient space, enabling iterative and interpretable optimization.

Purpose: To evaluate the DINOv2-based Medical Slice Transformer (MST) for ruling out significant findings (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System [BI-RADS] >=4) in contrast-enhanced and non-contrast-enhanced abbreviated breast MRI. Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved retrospective study included 1,847 single-breast MRI examinations (377 BI-RADS >=4) from an in-house dataset and 924 from an external validation dataset (Duke). Four abbreviated protocols were tested: T1-weighted early subtraction (T1sub), diffusion-weighted imaging with b=1500 s/mm2 (DWI1500), DWI1500+T2-weighted (T2w), and T1sub+T2w.

Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies.

Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA.

HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations. Experiments on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks show that HiMo-CLIP consistently outperforms strong baselines, particularly under long or compositional descriptions.

In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification.

To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes.

This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations.

The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations.

Vision-based gesture recognition suffers from high computational cost, sensitivity to lighting conditions, and privacy leakage concerns. Acoustic sensing provides an attractive alternative: by emitting inaudible high-frequency signals and capturing their reflections, channel impulse response (CIR) encodes how gestures perturb the acoustic field in a low-cost and user-transparent manner. However, existing CIR-based gesture recognition methods often rely on extensive training of models on large labeled datasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot VR scenarios. In this work, we propose the first framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for CIR-based gesture recognition in VR/AR systems. Despite LLMs' strengths, it is non-trivial to achieve few-shot and zero-shot learning of CIR gestures due to their inconspicuous features. To tackle this challenge, we collect differential CIR rather than original CIR data.

Recent video generation models can synthesize photorealistic visual demonstrations from language commands and images, offering a powerful yet underexplored source of training signals for robotics. However, directly retargeting pixel motions from generated videos to robots neglects physics, often resulting in inaccurate manipulations. PhysWorld addresses this limitation by coupling video generation with physical world reconstruction. Given a single image and a task command, our method generates task-conditioned videos and reconstructs the underlying physical world from the videos, and the generated video motions are grounded into physically accurate actions through object-centric residual reinforcement learning with the physical world model. This synergy transforms implicit visual guidance into physically executable robotic trajectories, eliminating the need for real robot data collection and enabling zero-shot generalizable robotic manipulation. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks demonstrate that PhysWorld substantially improves manipulation accuracy compared to previous approaches.
